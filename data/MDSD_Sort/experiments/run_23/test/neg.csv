 I had liked The Mother of All Pregnancy Books and decided to try this one. But I don't find it nearly as complete or helpful as "What to Expect the Toddler Years". I haven't read it cover to cover, but so far I find that the sections don't delve deeply enough into topics or offer unique suggestions/advice 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 This is a pathetic, shallow movie that insults person's intelligence. It is quite anti-semitic, by showing Jews not the way they are, but the way Jew-haters want to see them: as heartless bullies, obsessed with vengeance. The scene of an Israeli Mossad agent killing an Arab man on the street in Turkey before the eyes of his wife and little son elicits sympathy for the victim. We have been told that this was a Hamas leader, but this does not get much emphasis in the movie. The effect would be very different, if they would show first mass murder of innocent Jews done by such types as this Hamas leader. In this the movie is very manipulative. All three Mossad agents shown in the movie are caricature-like, made very cruel and unattractive. It is emphasized that the motivation for Mossad is vengeance and inability to forgive, but the truth is the vengeance is not a main motivation for Jews, but justice is.  If those Hamas murders are left alive, they will cause many more murders, and it is immoral to let them live. As to the part of the movie showing the pursuit of an old ex-nazi, it is totally stupid and unrealistic, and again vengeance is wrongly emphasized as motivation.  To sum up, this is a sad and un-artistic creation of degenerate secular Israeli culture, done by people without any healthy self-respect and any knowledge about their rich, beautiful and eternal Jewish tradition, which always did and still provokes hate from enemies of civilization 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 Apparently William Bennett is unfamiliar with the myriad wonderful books for children written in the last thirty years.  The only exception are "famous" people writing now like Barbara Bush.  Why not draw on the terrific current literature?  My guess is because Bennett would have to pay for that, whereas the older work is in the public domain.  What a lost opportunity to speak to kids in terms they can better relate to and to introduce parents to some fine contemporary writers.  Of course, this book is actually pitched to parents, not kids, so I doubt appealing to kids is actually his real aim 
 I rarely write reviews, especially for strategy guides, but once I got my hands on Mortal Kombat: Deception's strategy guide, I was spurred on by a suddenly active sense of decency and concern for the well-being of MK fans the world over.  Simply put: do NOT spend $15, or $10, or even tree-fiddy for this guide.  No amount of financial savings will make up for the fact that this guide is useless.  The first thing I realized was that the fatalities were missing for nearly all of the characters.  Only a few random fatalities were shown, I'm guessing because they needed to fill a blank space on a page with a screenshot of some sort.  Same goes for the hara-kiri moves.  Everything was incomplete, except for the voluminous move lists.  Like players would rather have access to all 400 moves for every player, but not the fatalities.  They're called priorities, people!  The Konquest mode walkthrough (or should I say, stumblethrough) is also poorly designed and confusing in its own way.  I found myself wondering where the hell I was and looking for an Outworld gas station.  (At this point, I'm above any potential humiliation from asking directions to a hidden character.)  Lastly, and this may be geek me talking, but the guide was littered with an ungodly amount of grammatical and spelling errors on every page.  A couple of random ones I can understand, but honestly, I think this was either poorly translated from another language, or the editing department wasn't paid enough to care if it looked any good.  So long story short, get the moves/fatalities/hara-kiris/whatever from a reputable gaming site.  You'll save money, and you'll get what you were looking for 
 I have to say, this is the first time that I couldn't read past the second chapter of a book. It's absolute trash! I have to say though, this is an excellent topic choice for a book, but I will never read another Charles Johnson book. Also, I don't know what the heck the National Book Committee is smoking, but I sure don't want any 
 Although a cursory look at the contents look comprehensive, a close look at the chapters are disappointing I know lots of scientist friends that devote their life studying LBP & pain generators like Dr Panjarbi In the section on pain generators in this book, instead of giving a good description of spinal segmental innervation, the works of Panjarbi etc, the author seemed to suggest that many previous writings & literature on this important aspect of LBP are 'conjectures at best' - though downgrading the hard works of others, the same author cannot give a good discussion of pain generators himself There is a hint there is inadequate respect of other people's work over the decades. Extremely disappointing attitud 
 Intellectual garbage on the subject of intellectual garbage 
 The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again 
 Readers can easily expect that an anthology of poetry about anarchism might be difficult to assemble given that few identify themselves as anarchists or write about anarchist themes.  Yet somehow Visions of Poesy: An Anthology of 20th Century Anarchist Poetry manages to cobble together 267 pages of versification.  I say "versification" because many of the entries do not qualify as "poetry" by any reasonable definition of the term except for their end-stopped lines.  The tragedy is the anthology's evident lack of poetic values unintentionally reinforces the erroneous notion that anarchism promotes chaos.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Anarchism promotes the order that results from mutual and fully-informed consent.  It opposes imposed order.  Apparently, in their zeal to create the impression that anarchy generates considerable poetic activity, the editors have left the impression that anarchism hasn't produced much poetry that is worthwhile.  A much shorter work retaining the few gems this anthology contains would have benefited this work and anarchism better. 
  This the way Jacqueline Rose describes the relationship between a suicide bomber and the victum "unbearable intimacy shared in their final moments by the suicide bomber and her or his victims. Suicide bombing is an act of passionate identification--you take the enemy with you in a deadly embrace." The difference between the west and the Islamofacsists is that we do not see the innocent as the enemy. To the suicide bomber innocent women and children are the enemy just as much as the soldiers. 
 I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame up the hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to make  their form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's a  tragic time we live in when all that matters is using religion for power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakes the United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess we in now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it's  people like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islam  hating war mongers 
 The review on the cover of the DVD reads "A snappy, sexy thriller..." I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.  Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.   The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about 
 This book has been, unfortunately, my first introduction to numerical analysis. I wish that I could have chosen a superior book myself, but this is the one prescribed by the university I attend.   The examples in this book are mostly short and insufficient, especially when they are most needed. The lack of good examples wouldn't be so much of a problem, however, if the text itself were better. Unfortunately, many topics are poorly explained. The notation used in this book is often awkward and confusing.   I'm used reading math textbooks and understanding them. Unfortunately, Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires expects the reader to understand concepts that aren't even fully explained in the text. Avoid if you can 
 TV does not work, whilst I get the picture, it is in black and white and there is no voice or sound apart from hissing noise 
 The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 Your conpany is a group of irresponsibil unprofesional amature.

 More theory than action.  No real benefit to my junior agents or experienced agents 
 This book does not go well with the class, I would suggest to any university that is using this book for IT 645 class, to find a different author. 
 I was unimpressed and also left quite uniformed on several issues concerning me. A lot of words here, the authors seem quite verbose, but the words ring empty. I would say I found it difficult to find anything I wanted to locate in this work. In all actuality there was truly nothing of substance to find. Metaphorically I was left empty handed.  
 Every track on this 2-disc compilation represents the best of the early work of Neil Young as selected by the one who knows best: Neil Young himself.  The liner notes are also written by the man himself.  Too bad about the sound quality though which is one of the worst that I've ever heard and believe me, I've heard many, many, many cds.  The volume levels are so low and the sound so muddy that you can only describe this album as a waste of plastic.  This a great shame though as quite clearly the quality of the tracks and the performance of Neil Young are first class.  My recommendation is to wait for a properly-remastered version of this must-have album for all lovers of early Young and great music in general to be released.  Hopefully, we'll get an mlps gatefold version with either HDCD or at least a 24-bit remastering done from the best available tapes from Warner's vault.  Perhaps the good folk at Rhino would like to try their hands at this project.  Just don't get this very, very poorly mastered and recorded version 
 I really NEEDED this printer.  I even overlooked the 'shaking' of the printer and table it sat on during printing.  In less than a year-the scanner errors began and the ink catridge symbols are a problem.  I have always loved HP but now will try a Canon printer 
 The book contains some interesting winemaking tips.  Unfortunately, the quality of said information gets lost in the twisted tangle of grammatically challenged pages.  Two stars for the information and zero stars for the presentation 
 Alas.......A good friend recommended this book for me. He really enjoyed the heck out of it, but I guess I didn't get the same thrill out of reading it. In fact, it was like a big sleeping pill for me to try and finish this book. Sorry 'bout that Steve......but like any book I've ever read, there are always some tidbits of information that makes a person smarter, so I'm not unhappy that I read it. If a person is really into environmental issues, then this just might be the kind of book some other reader is looking for.  	Basically the author tells of his 20+ years as a park forest ranger on the north-western coast of California, Sierra Nevada of California, Wyoming's Grand Tetons, and a couple of other locations. His primary focus was the government-owned land of the American River that is condemned to be covered by a dam some day. In his mind it is doomed land that will eventually be flooded over and never to be enjoyed by human kind again. It will be a home that will be taken from the existing animals that now preside there. The flora and fauna will eventually be covered by water too. Of course, whatever good might come from the dam such as a new water supply for the ever-expanding human population, new wildlife in the form of fish, water fowl, underwater plant life, etc. aren't considered as a positive tradeoff. Instead, a new dam is just more human exploitation of mother nature.    	Smith spends some time talking about the human element of being a park ranger and the kinds of people that spend time in the public park system, but mostly his focus was on the negative side of the human experience (the armed miners, wild druggies, alcohol-crazed losers, squatters, motorcyclists, gangs, bridge jumpers, etc.). Not much was mentioned about the vast majority of the public (families, campers, and nature lovers) who visit the national forests and treat it with respect.   	Smith gives his reader lots of history and geography lessons throughout the book. What it was like to be a park ranger really took the back seat to the author pressing his environmental and political agendas.  Instead, we are given a big dose of environmental politics and conservationist history which I found to be mostly dry and uninteresting. In my mind, Smith made 'Man' the bad guy. I also felt that he was a rather bitter person as he looked back on his years as a ranger.   	Sooooooo........the bottom line is that this book didn't quite do it for me. 
 This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion.  
 I found this textbook to be utter garbage and a complete and confused mess.  Easily the worst text book out of my recent courses.(Campbell's Biology and Pasachoff's Physics are world's better.  I find it difficult to believe this is about as good of a book as an organic chem professor can write.  Very sad if this were true.)  A dearth of example problems make learning this far more difficult than it need to be.  This is made worse given the fact the problems for students at the end of the chapter don't build up bit by bit from earlier portions of the chapter until it ties it all together.  That's not even discussing just how few of these problems have any answer in the back of the book.(Since it's so easy to get a completely wrong but reasonable looking answer that's a big problem and pretty much means the solution manual has to be bought with it.  Almost seems like a scam to trick students out of over $200 by splitting the cost between two books.)  Also I get the impression that the authors have a crippling phobia of math and equations.(Just look at the end of chapter 7 where 2 pages of text could have been replaced by the equation for doing a SODAR calculation.)  Just utter garbage which isn't good given that organic is trying enough as it is 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 I read this book about 20 years ago in high school and hated it. I just tried to read it again for a book club discussion. I thought that 20 years of life experience and growth may have changed my attitude toward this classic. It didn't. I made it half way through and decided to quit wasting my time. The characters are self-serving, and I just didn't care about them. The stream of consciousness style of writing is not my thing. 
 This movie really stinks! I would not recommend it to anyone. Really stupid and short on plot. Not very interesting. Not even funny. Don't waste your money 
 I understand the fascination with this 'book.' People want to make changes in their lives, find love, money, family, happiness etc - but people want to do it the cheapest way possible! Come on guys, are you kidding me? What do you actually expect for $5 dollars? This book attempts to show you how to use goal setting to change things in your life, but there are so few pages, each with a tiny amount of information. I have seen one extended review here on amazon by a man called Brad Jenson. The pamphlet isnt much longer!  If you want to change your life then you have to INVEST in your future. Two books i have to recommend are 'THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO COSMIC ORDERING' by Andronicos Andronicou. Its expensive, but its worth it. A really fantastic book that expects you to go 'out there' but trust in it and you will get some amazing results. The other book is 'ASK AND IT IS GIVEN' by Ester and Jerry Hicks. The book will help you to find balance in your life.  If you are still wondering if this pamphlet will work for you let me give you a little bit of advice. Go outside, take a 5 dollar bill from your wallet, and set it on fire with a cigarette lighter. You may wonder 'what is the point in that?' my answer is that i just saved you a 2 day wait for an amazon delivery.  There is so much better stuff out there, go find what interest you, buy it, and change your life 
 I love good thrillers, and am willing to put up with a few flaws for the sake of a good story. But I had to stop reading this one. There were just too many situations where the characters behaved in completely implausible ways. For example: when the main character Nina's 11-year-old son goes missing, her brother tries to get her to go out to dinner. I cannot imagine that idea even crossing the mind of any actual human I have ever met. Later, while the son is still missing, Nina is attacked and her belongings destroyed by her erstwhile client. In a piece of truly extraordinary dialogue, our heroine declines to inform the police who did it and asks the client whether she did it "because of the case." (A case which Nina had just won for the client.) The client proceeds to verbally attack Nina, who backs down. What?? I am inclined to think the heroine should have been named Ninny--no one that spineless could have made it past the first two weeks of law school, or at least not the one I attended. My capacity for suspending disbelief was pushed far past the breaking point with this silly book 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 The author gives an important perspective on chronic, undiagnosed pain.  As in _Vinegar Hill_ , her knowledge of Catholism is incorrect 
 The jewish tradition about parables are an effort to defigure  the Christ meaning. Rabi's wisdom never will be the same of Jesus, the Messiach, Son of God 
 This DVD is awful, with the director commentary at points in the movie and no way of turning it off without mute and reading sub-titles. It disrupts the scenes including some of the chase and shooting scenes esp the ending.  Avoid this at all costs.  Totally annoying 
 There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English 
 I couldn't believe that this was a real story with real people acting in real ways for a moment. The acting, writing, and directing were as hokey as hokey gets. To hear John Wayne utter his lines is to watch the most one dimensional performance ever, and his characterization is a characature of a tough-guy, bravadolike cowboy. It was like watching Saturday Night Live. The other characitures were equally bad, playing on the most superficial level.   The story is nothing more than a hodgepodge of western cliches, and no amount of desert sunsets and boulders can rescue this unbelievable, laughable film from the world of make-believe! I couldn't wait until the film ended because for me it was an ongoing ordeal. Also, It was way too long, with lots of unnecessary subplots--just useless padding!   Unless you like comic book charicatures--without depth or believability--and cornball dialogue (that you've heard in a million other westerns), don't waste your money on this. Better go with High Noon or Shane, which have believable characters, a courageous hero, a suspenseful story, credible dialogue and are not longer than they should be 
 I seen these guys live, not a kid, just too lazy to create an account. The guitar, bass and drums were rumbling like a freight-train. I was ready for the singer to start howling like so many of the other great stoner/sludge bands but then it happened. The vocalists opened his mouth and all I heard was grrr-rooooraoora-grrrr. Come on man the death metal thing has died. It's plenty heavy, the music is great but the singing kills it. I'll go listen to Orange Goblin, Fu Manchu, Nebula, I may find a use for High on Fire but it will probably be when I am pushing some weights. Outside of that it is too grrrro oorrrror arrra for any other use 
 Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months.   I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player. 
 I have no problem with 'difficult fiction.'  My two favorite authors are Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace.  I tend to gravitate back to "Gravity's Rainbow" over and over because every time I re-read it I find something new.  I have only thrown a book against a wall twice in my life.  The first time was when I read the "Lena" chapter in Stephen R. Donaldson's "Chronicles of Thomas Covenant vol 1" (I did however continue reading that book and ended up enjoying it), and the second time was when i finished the first chapter of this book by Rick Moody.  The opening with the endless and endless and endless list of the sun sweeping across the world was bad enough, but following that with a chapter about a woman with the backdoor trots?  I didn't have a problem with the subject matter (I also happen to love reading hard core horror fiction-- Ed Lee, Jack Ketchum, etc) but it was just too much of a bad thing.  I intend on picking up another of Moody's books and having a crack at it.  I'll just make sure I check it out from the library, which, luckily, I did with "The Diviners. 
 As a VP of Sales & Marketing for a company with a complex sales process, I recognize the importance and difficulty of lead generation. Unfortunately, this book gives absolutely no quality information or insights into how to generate leads more efficiently. The tone of the book is academic - it strives to sound important but ends up in most instances saying nothing. Here's an excerpt from a section headed "Iterative Approach with Tactics": "By manipulating tactics to perform just a little bit better, it is hypothetically possible to double the response rate for a program without increasing spending. That said, the appropriate action is to optimize your tactics continuously and incrementally as performance dictates..." I think the author is saying that you can generate twice as many leads if you improve your lead generation program, especially if your current program isn't very good. In terms of content, the first 80+ pages pretty much make two points over and over: (1) that sales and marketing have to work together for successful lead generation, and (2) you need to define what a "lead" is. The other 120 pages of the book skim lightly over various methods of lead generation - none of the methods are new or imaginative; they are the same methods any marketing professional is already familiar with. If you are brand new to the idea of lead generation, this book will give you an overview, but if you're experienced and looking for new and imaginative insights, look elsewhere 
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 I bought this book hoping to get clear, technical know-how from its authors.  These other reviewers here helped to solidify my purchase.  What a huge mistake.  Chapter 1 thru 6 are CONSTANT repeating of the same points, over and over.  I swear, chapter 2 is like chapter 1, as are the next few chapters.  How many times do I need to be told about "transitive properties between forests, and compatibility with Windows NT and 2000... "?  I kid you not, many many pages are repetitive. Chapters are repetitive.  Did the proof reader not compare chapters between the various authors and red-line?  It's as if they did not compare amongst each other, if indeed that's how the book got compiled.  Ok... Worse: I think this book is for the human administrative guy who needs to learn some concepts so that he does not appear like a complete idiot when speaking with Network gurus in the coffee lounge.  This book is like trying to help people who know little about Networking to make a plan on how to migrate and create policies that should be enforced, etc.  I feel like I'm in a mixed class of Psyche 101 and Business Relations 202 when reading this.  I have not yet read past chapter 6 but I have definitely skimmed ahead to see of the content seems any deeper and I'm disappointed.  Are there many scanned images of the Windows 2003 Server screens?  No.  Very few.  To me, this is not a book for people who want to know the ins & outs of how to make the OS fly like lightning and all the tips & tricks one comes to expect for a book of this size 
 I was really disappointed with this book. Most of it is written in a " it is known to have been" style which sounds like guessing. The info is basically a list of styles. The photos are terrible 
 I've subscribed to Self on-and-off for about 15 years, but have recently been feeling like I've outgrown the magazine. The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers.  Fine, but not for me anymore!  Also, their subscription department is terrible!  My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together.  
 This book is possibly the stupidest book I have ever read. The stories are boring with no plot or character development. Do not read this book 
 I have the 1995 British edition of this book - same cover, same authors, presumably the same text inside, but with the title "Postmodernism for Beginners". I think that title falls foul of the U.K's Trade Description Act, but so, I think, does the present one. I know a little about Postmodernism from a much better short book (Christopher Butler's "Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford 2002), and I found particularly the first half of the Appignanesi book absolutely impenetrable. That first half, unlike Butler's, includes Structuralism in Postmodernism; but on Structuralism you would do much better to read John Sturrock's short "Structuralism" (Paladin), which is much more lucid and accessible, even if it doesn't have pictures in it! The second half of the Appignanesi book does at least have some suggestive ideas about the contemporary world.  
 I never quite understood why everyone seemed to love this book so much. I read it, along with my entire grade, in seventh grade, and found the book to be annoying. I was especially annoyed by flawed characters, and a not very impressive writing style. Many people are impressed by this book, saying it is an accurate portrayal of life then. I understand and respect that. Many books are accurate. That does not make them good. In this case, it's a book that is reasonable (not terrible, no), and at the same time has many deep flaws, the chief of which is the characters. To put it simply, I was unimpressed by the book, and don't understand why it is considered something so incredible. It is just an ordinary, okay-quality book 
 I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes.  Has anyone used this 
 Even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product (as described), I still would have returned the item.  The mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it wasn't really suitable for the intended purpose 
 I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one.  Some Dream System.  The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well.  After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas.  I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!!  And i haven't even watched a movie ye 
 I hated this Van Damme movie. I own all his others but I could not bring myself to add this to my Van Damme collection. I found this to be a very bad movie with very low production values. There was nothing in this movie for me other than annoyance. Very poor direction, cheap and laughable special effects, particularly the exterior train sequences where the train looks like it is made of wood, illuminated with a light bulb from the inside and pulled along by a piece of string. Bad lighting, badly filmed, executed and edited martial arts and action sequences. Laughable acting performances from all including Van Damme. Very bad audio post production special effects to such an extent that at times you can't hear character dialogue. I got the impression that a lot of this was filmed in very low lighting conditions to hide the cheap sets and obvious poor special effects. Basically the movie is a cheap rip off version from a mix of Under Siege 2 with Steven Seagal and The Cassandra Crossing with the late Richard Harris. I would say to anyone thinking of buying this to go and rent it on the cheap first before splashing out your cash. You might be thankful you did. 
 Wolf's attempt at an analogy between psychological change and his confused interpretation of physical transformation is just silly. I would recommend Satinover and McTaggart if you're interested in the new science 
 My son expected the tie to be maroon and it is definately purple so we were extremely disappointed and returned it! Amazon was VERY prompt in refunding out money 
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 If you suspect you or your child has ADHD ("A.D.D." is not the correct acronym), please look elsewhere for treatment and practical strategies.  Any ADHD intervention book worth its salt includes a variety of approaches to treatment.  If you want to avoid medication, there are plenty of options - this book is nothing novel.  However, medication does work best for many children and adults and the benefits definitely outweigh the "costs" (which are relatively minor - these medications are considered quite safe).  Stimulant medications do not "change" children's personalities or "break" their spirits - they help them improve their ability to function academically, emotionally, and socially.  Why wouldn't you want these things for your child?  Please talk to a physician or psychologist and ask for book recommendations.  This book is a waste of time! 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I love my HoMedic diffuser, esp. the gurgling brooke sounds, but after trying each of the four "aromatherapy" beads, I much prefer to use a round cosmetic cotton pad with a few drops of pure essential oils. The beads are kind of stinky, and though they claim to contain essential oils, any experienced nose will tell you that they definitely include synthetic fragrance oils, as well.  If you want to fragrance your room, you'll do better with a candle or spray, but I would never use those things personally.  Aromatherapy isn't based on fragrance. It's based on specific traits of specific plants and flowers, which are incredibly concentrated and potent in their distilled form. If the substance you're smelling isn't a pure essential oil, or is adulterated with synthetic perfumes, it's not therapy. It's just aroma.  A good, inexpensive alternative is to pick up 2 or 3 pure EOs from your local health store. A good start- Lavender, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lemon. Learn about the qualities of these oils, from a basic book or Google search, and experiment with a drop or two on a cotton pad in your diffuser.  You'll enjoy the pure aroma and it will indeed be therapeutic 
 I rented this movie tonight, having vaguely remembered the trailer from 2003.  The synopsis on the box was intriguing enough, although I realized the potential for a hackneyed portrayal of an all-too-common family comedy theme.  I was hoping for a cleverly-written dark dramedy along the lines of a Charlie Kaufman or Wes Anderson film.  What I experienced was a trite presentation of your textbook dysfunctional family.    The film had its moments, but those moments were far too rare.  There was little in the way of character development; in fact, the character who experienced the most development was the dead one.  As screwed up as this family is, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and I couldn't bring myself to care about their lives even a little bit.  Even the big revelation at the burial service, perhaps the most interesting moment in the film, was somewhat of a ho-hum moment.    I really had high hopes for this one, but in the end it just fell flat for me 
 This time out,a group motocross racers on their way to a tournament,and their bus breaks down conventially in the desert where Pluto(who was killed by the dog in the first movie)and the Reaper are hiding in the hills waiting to terrioze those unlucky enough to end up in their neck of the woods.The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is an unessecary sequel,Pluto was only human and the family dog killed him,he can't come back to life hello!The group of teens tries to fight off Pluto and the REaper.Worthless waste of time,I have saw movies that were a lot a worse,but this one should still be passed up 
 The book was confusing and not helpful.  You may like it if you are an English professor, otherwise don't buy it.  
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 Budget compilations are by definition lacking, usually leaving out major hits in favor of obscure numbers that don't appear on more "proper" greatest hits albums.  This one is an exception in that EVERY song on here also appears on the far superior "Ratt N' Roll 8191", which has many more songs.  The only benefit to this one is the remastering, but I'll take more songs over slight sound improvement any day.  Get RNR8191 instead, you can't go wrong 
 I love these whacky kind of comedys, and when I heard about this one I tried to track it down for about 2 years. Finally after it's release here for under $5 aus. I was highly disapointed by waiting in anticipation for what I was sure was going to be histerical 'cause of what other reviewers wrote about it..  It was a complete bore for about 30 minutes. I didnt think what they where doing was funny at all. The only funny bits where a couple of the sketches Chevy Chase was in and an amusing puppet. But the 4 or 5 laughs I had during this movie didnt save it.  I'd recomend you watch Kentucky Fried Movie instead of this snore fest. Even it's attempt a stoner humour failed. Beleive me, i love these kind of movies, but this is by far one of the biggest piles of $#!% I have ever seen that so many have said is a classic. It doesnt compete with goof satire movies like... - Kentucky Fried Movie  - Airplane / Flying High 1 & 2  - Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3  - Repossessed  - Silence Of The Hams  - Spaceballs  - HotShots 1 & 2  - Loaded Weopen - Scary Movie  - History Of The World - Young Frankinstein - Anything by Monty Python  check out one of those instead 
 It is Friday, moast Christians cannt eat the FLESH of Christ this day. I  am eating fish instead. I especially like PIKE. But fish is the symbol of  Christ too. I'm confused about this. Thank you 
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag 
 Not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with Freeway. I am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out, it has reese witherspoon after all, how bad could it be? Well, really bad. First of all on a good note, reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie, although her character isn't all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much. But Reese does a good job with what shes given.  My main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy. It's more like a comedy that also wants to be dark, graphic and serious, or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny. The result is that it's a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it's trying to do. Both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen.  But hey, if you find being shot in the neck, or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny, you just might like this movie 
 I'm addicted to bad movies. Really bad movies. Ones that make you laugh at its pure inadequacy and the ones that are so cheesy that you can't help but be entertained. Then there are ones that are so bad you would have to be a masochist to sit throughout the entire duration of it. Ed Wood's "Bride of the Monster," "Burial Ground," and "Manos: Hands of Fate," are three classic horrible movies that I have had the dishonor of seeing and will never forget the pain and boredom that I felt while suffering through the viewing of them. "Hell of the Living Dead" is definitely one terrible zombie flick that certainly and positively belongs among the worst movies ever made. First of all, it basically covers all of the zombie cliches ever created throughout the history of zombie movies. Jungle savages, mad scientists, a little gore, a little blood, extremely fake looking special effects, a random soldier dancing in a green tutu, top hat, and cane, and really really bad zombie make up makes this movie well worth watching. Also, I can't understand why this movie is on the video nasties list. "I Spit on your Grave" and "The Last House on the Left" are much more disturbing than this movie. In any case, you should check this movie out if you want something to make you fall asleep quickly or if you are a true masochist and desire great amounts of suffering and pain 
 I have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it wasn't the same movie I have. This movie in no way represents the life of La Cosa Nostra. There are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic. It's present day and the guys are "running numbers". Hello, ever hear of the Lottery. They start up a "bookie buisness". Besides calling it a bookie buisness, which is just plain retarded, how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster. Then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him. I guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over. Then again that might have been a good thing. The acting was terrible except for the late Ray Serra and Joe D'Onofrio. Even Joe Viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed Tons of work. Rent the HBO film Gotti if you want to see what it's really like. Just to include Wannabees and William DeMao in the same breath as Goodfellas and the great living legend Robert DeNiro is an insult. Now DeMao is making "Searching for Bobby DeNiro", he could only wish. The only reason I gave it a star is because I had to, they dont let you give it none 
 While I much rather prefer to read about the U.S. Civil War and The Second World War, it seems that I have read this book in bits and pieces elsewhere. None of the information presented by Mr. Fromkin came through as especially enlightening to me and the majority of his main thesis - A localized dispute between the Hapsburg Empire with Serbia being used as a pretext for the German Military to incite a continent wide war - was not all that shocking. That coupled with the redundancy with which the author presented his argument would have me advise you to check elsewhere for another book on this topic 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 Donald O'Connor was great in Singing in the Rain. Der Bingle. Mitzi Gaynor. A Cole Porter score. P.G. Wodehouse on the script. How can anything go wrong? The arrangements were too dull for a memorial service. O'Connor and Gaynor danced on the deck of a cruise ship, but they tried to copy Astaire and Rogers and failed. And the love scenes? They missed the part in the script where the protagonists interact in a way that is a prelude to romance. They are suddenly just in love. Then the two females get headaches, but they weren't the only ones. Don't try to make sense of this one. It is simply a footnote in movie history to show how and why musicals disappeared from production schedules by the 1960s 
 This work represents all that is wrong with certain elements of the liberal establishment.  Instead of acknowleding what's good in the Church, they insist on continuing their campaign of hatred against one of the remaining bastion of decency in this world...But again it is so fashionnable to be anti-catholic in certain groups nowadays.. 
 Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit 
 Well, while I enjoyed the biochemical explanations for sugar addiction, the 'diet' itself is like so many out there now.  Basically, stay away from sugars and white foods (except for that potato)..  It also seems to embody some of the glycemic index theories..  All in all, I wasn't impressed..  It's helped so many people though, it might be worth a shot for someone else.. GOOD LUCK 
 What a waste of time. Such boring dialogue, it made me fall asleep 
 I found this book sophomorically disorganized, rambling and the author's obvious lack of concern for the reader presumptuous if not insulting.  He pretentiously ambles from one discussion to the next, most having little if any relation to the purported topic and almost all of it useless in a more general sense.  I would say the title is an apt description and the author thoroughly convinces his reader though probably not in the intended way 
 I wrote Osprey Publishing and pointed out that in the chapter on Coral Sea and Midway; TBD Devastators were identified as TBF Avengers. The 35 Torpedo Bombers that were slaughtered at Midway were not all Avengers(Except for a small Midway detachment.) There were NO TBF's at the Coral Sea. How does this get through the editing and printing stages????? They said they would correct the error in future printings, I am stuck with a DUD copy. This is POOR publishimg at its best. I own thousands of dollars of Osprey books and I am mortified to say the least. 
 This is nothing like the classic dead you've heard about.  Far from it.  The sound is too polished.  "Alabama Get Away" and "Althea" are okay but the rest is junk.  I think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the Deads' best music.  Really... The Grateful Dead with a polished sound??  Just doesn't seem to fit.  Save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations,plus American Beauty, Worjing Man's Dead, Europe '72 and "Dead Set"

 I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances.  I'm not the only one.  Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways.  It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product.  Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend.  On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking 
 Great Product but shame on Amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software.  Kudos to Acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10.  Acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful 
 But at the end of the day, Leach believes in scheduled feeding, scheduled sleeping. She's opposed to the family bed. She encourages  short duration breastfeeding for everyone, but her feeding schedule and her solid foods introduction quite clearly are opposed to breastfeeding for longer than a few weeks. It's great that she puts such an emphasis on sustaining the adult relationship. It's a pity that her strategy is so at odds with including the child in the adults' lives.  If you plan to breastfeed for more than a month or so, be very wary. If you plan to do a family bed, you'll find no support here. If you intend to include your baby in your evening, you'll have to go somewhere else 
 I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware 
 This item sucks, got it, broke second time I tried using it. Simply do not buy this overpriced piece of plastic 
 There are no magic wands, including this book.  I can say what I want, and it won't get published.  Not everyone who experiences the elephant becomes broken.  Sometimes we learn to make friends with it because it's not as scary as professionals make it out to be as in this book.  Society creates PTSD, not war.  Essays won't help men cope.  They must believe, individually, deep within, that what they did was acceptable, however horrific.  When men and women do this, professionals have no idea what to do with such souls, so they write books--like this one--with their nice and neat ideas of how to unsee a seen perception by treating the man or woman in order to fit them in a normal bell-curve in which such men and women don't even belong.  Ph.D.s et al, who write such beautiful prose and theories with all their citations for proof, as this book has succeeded in accomplishing, will never understand the truth of war and its consequences from the outside looking in.  As long as such professionals remain steeped in their safe academe, continuing to write about supporting a societial perceptual norm of "what is healthy after war," completely sanitizing the soldier's mind for civil consumption, such books as this one will read as a magical elixir for the men and women painted with the acronym: PTSD.  Such works, are themselves, illusions of the truth 
 It is the year 2005. The 21st Century. We've put men on the moon. We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets.  But we can't design a simply on/off button.  The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off.  It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off.  Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 So my girlfriend made me read this book. I almost broke up with her  because of it. I mean, come on people! Nothing happens in the book, the cats who are supposed to help solve the "mystery" don't lift a paw, the whole thing is so bad and convoluted that at the end, the author has to explain to you all the things that happend that she couldn't manage to fit into the book somehow, so there was no way for you to even have any clue at all what was happening.  Look, I love cats. They're cool. This book made me want to kick cats and the author. Don't waste your time unless you like falling asleep in the middle of scenes that are supposed to be "action" or getting really angry that you paid for this book. (I didn't...my girlfriend loaned me hers. I gave it back. Good riddance. 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give  hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes  after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists!  The fact that  she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is  divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective  her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must  read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't 
 The book works around a sample database which supposedly could be downloaded from a link in the book.  The link proved to be outdated and no sample database could be found.  This is a serious flaw, as the beginner has no visual reference point 
 This blender died after 4 months of light use. I never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous. I only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries. After two months the motor started to have that burned smell when I used it. After three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack. At four months, the motor started making funny noises, it smelled terrible, and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use. All in all, this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash. I will NEVER buy a Hamilton Beach product again 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 ACTIONABLE SPECIFICS.  This book was so laden with sales pitches for Hicks' newsletters and seminars, so padded with testimonials, and so vague as to courses of action as to be almost useless.  Also missing:  Information on property valuation, handling tenants and leases, using the Internet to find properties and financing, and more...  On the good side:  It did give me a bit of introduction to the jargon of the real estate business, but most of all, it gave me a list of features to avoid in other books, starting with the name Tyler Hicks 
 Seeing so many used discs (of Chaos & Creation) selling cheap should've been a tipoff, but i plunged ahead - straight into the toilet; buying one, and trying really hard to find some depth, some quality, SOMETHING worth listening to. But, alas, i found little. Very little inspiration here at all. Maybe these songs could've used his BAND to inject some drive, some spunk, some imagination. Boring string arrangements (if playing one note can be called an arrangement), stale guitar parts, drum machines. God, what a bollocks from such a talented songwriter and musician. Paul, re-hire your band before they get away! Please 
 This book had some interesting half-baked ideas about society, but it felt like a bunch of stories thrown together, straining for connection.  I didn't really like or relate to anyone in the book, and felt vaguely depressed upon finishing it.   I wish I had stopped reading in the middle.. 
 As a collector of the entire series, no one awaited this book more than I.  I feel let down.  Of the 13 stories, (and it's only 318 pages, not 352), seven are fiction.  These were not well chosen: selections from Treasure Island and Moby Dick are not even set at sea, but are the land-based openings of the books.  The non-fiction does not live up to the billing of the editorial reviews that preceded it on this page.  There is not much shipwreck or survivial: several are more like philosophical essays as opposed to stories with an edge.  The story on diving the Andrea Doria is perhaps the best in the book, but many of us will have seen it elsewhere, as it is recent.  Why a fictional account of the Titanic and not a true one?  For a book on treasure, why nothing of Mel Fisher and the Atocha?  If you want sea adventure, the earlier book in the series, Rough Water, delivers a bigger punch.  This volume, regratably, is one that you can put down between stories 
 This book helped me a great deal, however the 501c3 application in it is old therefore when you are using the step by step guide in the book on how to fill out the 501c3 application the steps are off and dosen't match the current application. Some steps in the book miss a lot of questions the new application has. My advice, by the new 7th edition instead then you'll get your monies worth. By the time you buy this book and pay shipping it's best to buy the newer version 
 The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back - said he'd had it too long.  I will never buy this product, nor work with this seller again.  HORRIBLE. 
 I, like a lot of others was kind of annoyed when I saw another issue out.  I own the extended and theatrical releases already.  BUT, I had to buy them to see the "Never before behind the scenes documentary". To be honest, I wasn't impressed.  A few funny things, but all in all...I could have lived without it.  It's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason.  The Extended version extra material is so far superior.  That's my opinion. But like me, you may just have to have it! Shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us! If you don't own the movies and are generally not into the extras, this is definitely a good way to go,  You get both versions and in a very smart package 
 This has been called a Viking version of Beauty and the Beast. They had the sets, props, costumes, and boats..... but they could have used some actors and a script. They were about as Viking as the Egyptians were Egyptian in the 1940s era movies. They stole their actors from B rated '80s glam rock. This movie is to Beauty and the Beast what a soap opera version of Men in Tights would be to History. It may be good for a laugh, especially when trying to do it justice in a review 
 What a great idea for a book. Three runners from different backgrounds and countries each competing to be the first man to run a four minute mile.  I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  After many, many pages detailing training, training, adn more training I began to skim in ernest. By the time the featured race was run, I was all out of steam.  I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong with the book other than it is really dry and boring.  Maybe if the author had gotten more into the personalities and less into the training regimens.  Anyway, somewhere they say it is "soon to be a major motion picture".  Mabye the movie will be better.  
 I was immensely disappointed by this film. The "avant-garde" style of the film has been done better by other filmmakers (specifically Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, and Harmony Korine), and the film is mostly about Jonathan, not about his mother. The critics made this film sound like it was an attempt by Jonathan to bring him closer to his mother, to try and understand her by making a film about her, and to bring "closure" to their relationship. Well, the film isn't really about Jonathan's mother, it's strictly about him. We hear and see tons of information (with annoying title cards) about Jonathan's life, career, and loves. It feels like an episode of "this is Jonathan's life", as if Jonathan is this absolutely fascinating, brilliant individual that we must all pay attention to. He may become a great artist someday, but he isn't there yet. Jonathan uses his mother merely as an excuse to make a very self-indulgent, narcissitic film about himself. He doesn't really seem interested in her, other than as an excuse to show how much HE'S suffered, not really about her suffering. While Jonathan had a horrendous childhood, I felt very little sympathy towards him, as he is constantly mugging for the camera in a "feel sorry for me, I'm gay and my mother is insane" way. The man has been taping himself since he was in grammar school, so he's just a tad in love with himself, methinks. Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy is a film that deals with a schizophernic, and it is much more interesting and artistic than this film (Korine's uncle is a schizophernic). Derek Jarman shot his films in multiple formats similar to this film, like 35mm, 16mm, video, and super8, and weaved the images into an artistic and fascinating tapestry. Kenneth Anger, as well as Jarman, infused a gay sensibility into their films, which Jonathan doesn't do very well. Overall, disappointing, considering critics said it was absolutely brilliant....   
 This book is rediculously boring. How a person can actually put their name on a piece of writing that so bad leaves me dumb founded. If anyone can find me anything similar to Cliff's Notes for this book, I'd love you forever, because in 1 month I've read 100 pages, and I'm 1 of those that actually enjoys reading. It had facts, but that's about it. Wow a summer well wasted.. 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 You bet he does! If you want to read a book by a notorious homophobic, right wing, friend of Dr. Laura then go right ahead. Know your authors!!! If I could, I'd have given him zero stars. Blah 
 There are some good pointers that will be familiar to those who have studied strategy, but the authors' attempt to dress up existing knowledge using the "hardball" metaphor is just a gimmick.    The authors laud "hardball players" such as Dell, WalMart, and Toyota.  These are the companies that pursue competitive advantage "with a single-minded focus."  As if on cue, the "softball players" are trotted out -- those companies that "aren't intensely serious about winning."  Wouldn't it be nice if it were this simple?  The truth is that many businesses play hardball but lose anyway.  Think about it.  The "hardball" sports analogy implies that the goal is to defeat one's competitors and, by doing so, win the game.  As somebody who has built a successful business, experience tells me that this is not accurate.  Truly innovative businesses learn how to change the game, or play their own game, and thereby deliver superior value and results.  Defeating your competitor might be a by-product of success, but it is not the main objective.  After all, Toyota didn't have to defeat BMW to become the powerhouse of the auto industry.  This book is too simplistic to be useful to anybody who already has a rudimentary grasp of corporate strategy 
 I didn't find this book interesting because all it talks about is Stacey and guys. This series never even talks about the Baby-Sitters Club anymore.I didn't get my moneys worth. In the story, Stacey's ex- boyfriends all come to see Stacey in Stoneybrook. The five of them all colide at this big party.It's the most dullest book I've read in my life. I agree with the person below me. DON'T READ THIS BOOK 
 She has the sensibilities and personality of someone from the 19th century. Completely without wit or charm or intelligence. The reader is *told* that Molly's smart because she's been to university, but there's absolutely no evidence of it. In fact, she's perhaps one of the stupidest heroines I've every had the displeasure of reading about. Not to mention that fact that she's spineless. I felt like kicking her 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD 
 Mr Dahl claims he does not intend to propose changes to the Constitution, but, rather, changes in how we think about it. Since he appears ignorant of his subject, I find him unqualified to suggest either.  Howbeit disrespectful of the powers of the States - and the people's rights as citizens of the States - the Framers were, they still knew of those powers and rights, and much of what they did and said - and what they did not do or say - was affected by that knowledge - a knowledge Mr Dahl either lacks or disrespects.  Many of the faults found with the Constitution share a source: the fact that many powers that have been arrogated by the "federal" government belonged to the States, at the time of the Constitutional Convention. The franchise, for example, was defined and controlled at the state level and the central government had no business trifling with it. Slavery was a matter of property law - a body of law over which the central government had no power. (Indeed, the amendment eventually adopted as the fifth prohibits expropriation except as accompanied by compensation or due process; even with compensation or due process, the property must be taken for public use - an eventuality unlikely to appeal to the average slave of the time.)  The time to discuss this separation of power - this check on central power - was in an early chapter of Mr Dahl's effort, and he failed even to hint at the power of the States, let alone to comment on their importance in balancing the power of the central government.  While Mr Dahl's book may have a certain curiosity value, to those who need to know how not to write political history, I found it worthless to anyone with an honest interest in his stated subject 
 With out a doubt, this has to be one of the darkest movies ever made. Once you get past the woodland creatures things, that were very well done, the movie gives you very graphic scenes of blowing peoples brains out, to torturing individuals that was also very graphically done. If you enjoy the horror of human suffering and pain, then this is the sick movie that you have been waiting for.    Hope you enjoy watching a movie all in subtitles.  
 Touching in parts, but I thought only character that was close to being well done was the little boy/protagonist; others were too sketchy or incomplete, although author tried but just didn't get there. You knew people were in pain, but it was like you could only observe them through a window, not reach out and touch them...Perhaps not my cup of tea. Any 9/11 novel deserves a better effort than this... 
 Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short.  It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution.  But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate.  Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator 
  Everything about the cover of Profoundly Disturbing - the shaky letters, the posed fright on the creased poster, the phony rating, the chapter titles mimicking credits, the dirty-looking border, and the display copy's warped cover, making it look used - fairly screams, "DON'T PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS BOOK!"  (Fortunately, amazon has discounted it.)  When did paperbacks start costing $24.95?  Especially one by Joe Bob Briggs - has he abandoned his working-class supporters?  His earlier paperbacks were less than $10; even hardcover editions of Cosmic Wisdom and Iron Joe Bob weren't $20.  Why is this book's price so high?  A look inside shows where some of the cash goes.  Glossy pages that reflect the light's glare make it hard to find a comfortable reading position.  The text is split into two columns, divided and almost surrounded by red borders.  Little red movie-related symbols cross the top of each page.  Why the obsession with red?  Has Joe Bob gone Communist on us?  Movie posters introduce each chapter.  And some awful fonts are chosen for the first paragraph of, and various statements from, each chapter.  In short, style trumps substance.  Why does Joe Bob require special effects?  He IS a special effect.  Well, he was.  Here, he makes his case for the movies that most influenced public tastes and later film making, some of which are known more for promotional antics than artistic merits.  He discusses how the idea for each movie originated, summarizes the plots (revealing each ending so that if you've never seen the films, you'll not be interested now), attempts to interpret those movies that make no sense, tells why he thinks the movie is important, and goes over the careers of the key actors, directors and/or writers involved, scattering trivia throughout.  At the end of each chapter, a guide covers related movies, often repeating information from the chapter.  While competent, the writing rarely rises above standard research reporting, and often failed to maintain my interest.  For example, I took 3 breaks while reading about And God Created Woman.  Why would any red-blooded American man make Brigette Bardot boring?  In his Reservoir Dogs chapter, Joe Bob condones plagiarism.  Does it follow that he steals from other writers?  If so, who?  I thought his style and outlook were unique, but if not, I'd like to read what his victims wrote.  Citing sources is common courtesy:  copying for profit or glory is theft.  For the money, too much is missing from this book - say, about 150 pages.  The index is incomplete.  It lists only movies, ignoring all of the people involved, as well as the innovations introduced.  Maybe Joe Bob felt that his coverage of Deep Throat was getting (ahem) long, but he fails to note that Linda Lovelace's nipples are never shown in the movie.  He doesn't explain the 1969 Naked Came the Stranger hoax.  He claims that, other than Linda, Carol Conners and Harry Reems, Throat actors had no later roles:  he completely overlooks Dolly Sharp, who, as Gloria Leonard, appeared in several X-rated movies through the 1970s, including one that he mentions, The Opening of Misty Beethoven.  (She also published the glossy adult magazine High Society, and hosted an adult cable TV show in New York City.)  Deep Throat was probably Gloria's best performance, though; she subsequently refused any on-screen anal scenes.  Now that's disturbing!  Joe Bob asserts that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced the chain saw as a weapon.  Not so - it was used a year earlier in Last House on the Left (granted, in self-defense).  He notes Saw's influence on metal bands, but neglects its effects on punk:  Johnny Rotten enjoyed the movie, and the first Ramones album includes a song about it.  Several more movies could have added bulk to this book, including The Birth of a Nation (1915), Birth Control and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (both 1917), Triumph of the Will (1935), M (1951, or the 1932 German version), Night of the Living Dead (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), Carrie (1976 - Joe Bob mentions a 1977 movie called Ruby, also featuring Piper Laurie, which reads like a Carrie rip-off), Caligula (1980), and Basket Case (1982).  Night of the Living Dead was mentioned in early promotions of this book, but that chapter must have been cut.   The most glaring omission, though, is Joe Bob himself.  After he temporarily quit writing in 1997, he seemed to have undergone a humor removal operation.  Where is the social commentary laced with his acerbic wit?  Where are such characters as Bobo Rodriguez, Cherry Dilday, and Rhett Beavers?  Where is his uncommon wisdom, so desperately needed in this country?  Apparently, they're all in his distant past.  H. L. Mencken estimated that a good writer has about 10 years of worthwhile work before he burns out.  Perhaps, then, we're lucky that Joe Bob provided a solid 15 years of refreshing, opinionated literature.  His writing used to provoke my delightfully shocked reaction, "Did he just SAY that?"  Throughout Disturbing, I kept wondering, "Why am I still reading this?"  Film scholars might find this book interesting.  To me, Profoundly Disturbing is primarily disappointing. 
 I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)  Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.  If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.  2.0 is about as useful as a football bat.   
 This is one of the least enjoyable books on films you will ever come across.  Totally dry and bland, Haskell just runs through women's history in motion pictures with thumbnail descriptions of classic films and the like, never really giving us the essence of any major female stars or even good analysis on specific films.  Don't take my word for it - check it out at the library and read it for yourself.  Bet you don't finish it!! 
 One great ballad, Evermore Without You, doth not a musical make. That song is stunning, slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding. The rest of the show is simply dreadful. Some is downright irritating." A secret, a secret.....", that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails. Horrible. I have a secret, stay away from this ridiculous mess. The plot is ludicrous, and the performances dull. They all sing it like they know how awful it is. And Michael Crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career.  Hopefully someone like Barbara Cook or John Barrowman will record Evermore Without You, so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash.  Sir Andrew, c'mon, surely you can come up with something better than this 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 The techniques described in this book are not something to play around with. If someone seriously attempts to follow these practices, there is the real possibility of becoming severely, phsycologically unbalanced. These  practices are meant to serve a purpose, but the author of this book NEVER  mentions that purpose. Without a use for the 'cultivated energy', energy  levels WILL build up to dangerously high levels. Be warned 
 I did not think this was an appropriate book for my 5 year old son.  It talked in some detail about eating the liver and lung of Snow White.  It ends with a description of the demise of the Queen, "But they had  already put iron slippers over a fire of coals, and they brought them in  with tongs and set them before her.  Then she had to put on the red hot  slippers and dance till she dropped down dead."  Need I say more?   This is not for small children!  The pictures are beautiful giving the book  a few stars, but there are only pictures on every other spread.  My son  continued to try to turn the page while I was reading the pages with only  words while I am trying to anticipate what to skip over 
 I was dismayed to discover Walker's acidic tone towards the Judeo-Christian religious tradition in this book. She seems to think that the fact that many Jewish and Christian symbols happen to have origins in Pagan cultures is somehow discrediting to Christianity and Judaism. In this and in some of her other writings, she makes it clear to the reader that it is her opinion that Judaism and Christianity are nothing more than a bastardized form of pseudo-Paganism in which the role of the woman has been subordinated. Merely because Judaism and Christianity borrow heavily from Pagan tradtions does not mean that they are not valid forms of spirtuality. It is all well and good to be proudly Pagan, but it is entirely unacceptable to denigrate other religions to be so. A true scholar must be strive to be as objective and unbiased as possible in their work, and Walker fails spectacularly in this respect. I do not reccommend this book to anyone, as Walker's blatant bias makes me highly suspicious of her scholarship, and my suspicions seem to be confirmed by other reviewers. 
 A relatively enjoyable book.  The numerous narrow escapes and quasi-scientific plot is a little thin.  Most of the stuff is not beleivable.  His first books were a bit better thought out.  He needs a break and a strong effort on his next book 
 Well, may be it's just my over-expectations :) Seriously - I am still chopping vegetables manually. This thing is good to make a mess or puree of anything you have. You can use it sometimes if you cook for yourself only and don't mind the look of results, although even in this case you will arguably spend more time cleaning the chopper. So, honestly, you don't want this. Buy a good knife or a grater. 
 I have wanted to read this book since I first heard of it. A timely Christmas present solved the first part of the problem; I eagerly jumped in immediately. And found many many problems.  The book is badly organized, repetitive, tedious, cliche riddled, prone to tarring with very broad brushes, and outrageously oversimplified. In fact, the book tells a great story in a terribly flawed way, much as the history books she reviews do. But she has no one to blame but herself. I could list many examples, but some of the other reviewers have done a good job on that. Let me just tackle one.  When knocking the attacks that originate on the "right", she lumps all manner of wildly divergent groups together. Names are strung together as if they all believe the same things, seek the same limitations, oppose the same passages. The "right" is a block of thinkers all trying to squelch evolution (which she blithely dismisses), ugliness, Satanism, secular humanism, on an on, blah blah blah. She never addresses whether the objections of some might be more valid than others. Whether the virulent anti-Christianity she so properly complains about later in the book might not be worth questioning and opposing  No, she knows the perfect answer to every problem, she knows the proper amount of negotiation required, she arrogantly can determine just where the proper "middle" path is.  Just as the windbag authors she excoriates know. It is hard to keep your voice out of the discussion when you feel passionately.  A limitation I didn't see mentioned elsewhere is pedagogical. The kind of teaching she imagines cannot happen in high school. Read two textbooks? As a former teacher, if I could have gotten my students to read one book I would have been thrilled. But two different books describing the same facts? In a single year? With students three to five years below reading level? Whoa...not in 50 minutes a day, lady. Not happening 
 I gave this 1 star because that's as low as Amazon will let you go. Where does this lady get her information? What really upsets me is the way she approaches the "West Memphis Three". I've got news for you Katherine...they were not a "satanic cult". Why don't you and HarperTorch publishing get your s#@!t together and get your facts straight before you decide to print this garbage 
 I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography. It has been nothing but a headache from day one. We have yet to be able to download any pictures. All of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them. The one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in English seem to be in a foreign language.  The directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties. You are suppose to call the phone #, but good luck getting through. I've tried for 2 days straight. They apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this "Educational camera".  As I am shopping for another camera, I will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera-  Sakar 
 I have yet to actually watch more than the first 10 mins. The quality is so bad I refused to go any further. For the life of me I can see how any Studio worth its salt could release anything so poor; where has "Pride In Your Work" gone. I could hardly make out the actors in this movie. I skipped forward by chapters just to see if some change had taken place, but to my dismay there was none. I am not one of those critics always writing bad reviews, in fact this is probably my second ever. I just had to warn other buyers so they don't get shafted like I did. In all fairness the movie itself may actually be great but for me what is the use if its un-watchable. Its almost like a bad bootleg movie (I refuse to watch those too). I am sure they could have spent some more time and money to remaster it and get all the graininess out and bring clarity to this film. All in all this is just my opinion and I hope it helps someone save their money, however if you don't mind the picture quality get it because I love the Trinity Saga 
 Ugh.  This is an example of how academia has invaded and pillaged modern music writing.  This woeful treatise on Dai Griffiths's random thoughts on pop music and the question of "classic status" uses Radiohead's OK Computer as an unfortunate jumping off point.  Most of the book is devoted to the study of pop music, the lexicon of recording conventions, and a labored breakdown of songs, not by sensible musical breaks, but awkwardly by minutes and seconds.  Reading this book is about as much fun as parsing a calculus equation.  Indeed it reminded me of why I am so glad to be out of school.  It's intellectual masturbation (or wanking, I suppose) of the worst kind.    A choice quote:  "...OK Computer might in time be a focal point for historians of life at the close of the twentieth century.  'This is what was really going on.'  You want to know what 1997 felt like?  OK Computer: tracks six - eight.  Pushed for time? - track seven."  Track seven of course is "Fitter Happier."  Yep.  That song sums up the end of the 20th century, according to Griffiths, and naturally, this record.  Point of fact, more time is spent discussing "Fitter Happier" in this book than for any other song on the album, a very strong indication of worthless dissection by a rhetorical bore.    Another great quote: "Thom Yorke is less a songwriter to my mind than a peculiar thing, an 'idea-led word-producer,' the words important as things in themselves rather than necessarily for their place in the song."  That from the section in the book, "Words."  And from the section, "Those pesky sound-effect openings and endings":  "I'm not sure about those bits, though they certainly pad out the time."    In other words, the sound design of each song's opening, ending, and/or transitions exist merely to support the author's argument that CD albums are typically longer than albums recorded for vinyl release.  Yes, those sonic orchestrations: time killers.  OK Computer is a remarkable album because of its ground breaking and remarkable music and lyrics.  This is a solid basis for a book of this kind.  Instead, this book is built upon the argument:  OK Computer is an album made up of sound effects, music with key and tempo changes, words about animals, death, moods, and electronics, and is remarkable only in that it was recorded for a CD, not a vinyl LP.  In fact, in time it will probably be remembered for being not very remarkable at all.  A note to the editors of 33 1/3: Next time hire a writer who actually enjoys the album he/she is writing about 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 I was very disappointed that the version of "Paper Roses" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated "Paper Roses.&quot 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 Yes, the album title is quite appropriate because everything that made this band amazing on previous releases (the shining example being Determination) is far beyond gone.  God Forbid traded all of their originality for popularity and a new streamlined sound.  Gone are the amazing and catchy two-part guitar harmonies and the incredible breakdowns.  Gone are the amazing lyrics that used to accompany thier music.  Gone are God Forbid as far as I'm concerned.  I gave this album two stars for effort.  The band is still and incredibly talented band, and I can respect the risks involved in introducing clean vocals into music that used to have almost none.  The vocals are quite impressive, and the instrumentalists are still rather talented.  This album is far too streamlined and hackneyed for this fan.  If you want to hear a really stellar album, check out Determination 
 I bought this book at the recommendation of my favorite magazine...Good thing I used a gift certificate and didn't waste my own money.  I gave it 2 stars, but maybe it's worth 2.5 stars-just for the effort. It does have some good ideas, but for the people like me, who love to organize but just don't have the space, it's not that useful. I was expecting more ideas about how to use the space I have. Unfortunately, I usually have better and more creative ideas than the author. Another major "-" is that the book talks a lot about throwing stuff away; well, what I have to say to that is that I periodically do that anyway, and I still am space challenged. That's not the solution to every problem 
 The sound is clear, but carries no base. I have a pair of Sony MDR-CD180 I paid $20.00 for that I was going to replace; I needed more volume and not loose sound quality for my MP3 player. These headphones are not it! Even at low volume all you get are the highs, there is no depth to the sound at all. I guess it all depends on what you want them for. If you listen to Heavy Metal, save you money, on this series anyway. The more expensive series may be better but I'm not going spend more money on something that may or may not give me sound quality I want. They look good sitting on the shelf though 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 I  liked Yate's novel "Revolutionary Road" very much, but found Easter Parade  disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life.  Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters.  When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed.  "The Easter Parade" is readable, but it is not good literature. 
 Yes, this book does have a few good stories to tell, but I was truly upset by the book's summary as it was usurped from the Museum of Neon Art's neon tours of Los Angeles. Almost word for word, Wallace has taken the Los Angeles history lesson of the tour's guide and used it for himself without citation or proper credit. This fact has diminished the value and integrity of book and I cannot recommend it. 
 It is truly ironic that a novel whose plot and characters culminate in a powerful condemnation of intellectual narrowmindedness (here portrayed by a scene of Muslim radicals burning Rushdie's Satanic Verses on a college campus) turns out to be no more than an allegorical book burning in its own right.  Kureishi's characters are rigid and simplistic proto-types of good and evil that appear to draw their inspiration from vulgar popular stereotypes rather than the imagination of a literary genius.  The protagonist's Muslim friends are befitting of what George Bush today calls "terrorists," while his secular mistress embodies all the excitement of intellectual and physical freedoms which, oddly enough, remain unadulterated in the writer's mind by the fact that she also happens to be a junkie and a nymphomaniac.  It could even be said that the author revels in her worldly vices which emerge as virtues in comparison with the excesses of religious fervor.  The final scene in which the protagonist's mistress and Muslim friend physically struggle for him, each pulling him by one arm in the opposite direction is a ludicrous and exaggerated portrayal of his inner struggle to compromise his faith and worldly passions.  This and other "key" scenes of the book (not to mention the dialogue) are so lacking in subtlety that they would do well in an elementary school reader where the audience cannot see beyond the obvious.  As is to be expected of a novel thoroughly colored by an (ironically) anti-intellectual aversion to religion, worldly passions hold sway and all good is ultimately on their side - including freedom of thought.  Unfortunately, Kureishi leaves his readers very little room to think in a story-line that categorically and unjustly rejects compromise between faith and intellectual illumination, forcing one to take sides in what ultimately ends up being a thoroughly anti-intellectual and propagandistic exercise in writing.  Though I treasure books that range from authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez to Marquis de Sade, this was the first that I had to relegate to the bin.  It did not deserve a place in what I consider to be an open-minded and intelectually stimulating literary collection 
 Ignatieff's credibility, particularly in the field of human rights, is forever tarnished by his marked appeasement of Serb ethnic cleansers in Bosnia several years ago. It is only because Bosnia was ignored, and those responsible never held accountable, that their appeasers still publish and get read. I recommend, for those who want some perpective on Ignatieff, to read his works pertaining to the Balkans written during the period 1992-1995 
 If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power.  What a noble guy!  Rage against the oppressed - what a man!  This book is insane.  I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....  why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure.  I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol.  
 Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right?  At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid 
 This CD does not have the songs that are listed on this site. "Here I Am" and "The Things You Do" aren't on this CD. Beware, the "Red, Red Wine" version is cut short also. Don't buy it unless your really know what it is you're getting 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here. 
 Simultaneously examining the first, second, and third waves of American feminism in her unprecedented volume, Sara M. Evans unwittingly squanders the tremendous potential from her initially good intentions.   Falling into the same 'post-feminist' trap readers are ironically warned against throughout the text, this book cannot unify second and third wavers. I certainly appreciate and have benefited from the work accomplished during this time period and am personally/professionally friends with individuals, but cannot see how a book ignoring my own generation's political activism is supposed to unify the two generations at large  Sharply contrasting with the glowing treatment given to herself and other second wavers, Evans only introduces the third wave as "recent participants in a world transformed by their mother's generation" (p. 213). In addition to implying that myself and others are really only interloping guests at 'somebody' else's social justice movement, this remark overlooks the critical perspectives we bring precisely as a consequence of growing up without legal segregation, with Title IX, Special Education, and many other programs which were only a dream for her generation.   While giving the 'riot grrrl' movement only one paragraph, she is oddly eager to devote much more book space to the faux feminists who made their public names attacking previous feminist theory (p. 221). Agreeing that it made for great mass media sensationalism, I do not accept this latter category as representative of my generation of feminist theorists, and am disappointed by Evans's stereotypes.   After ironically establishing how bias keeps women from being aware of their past (p. 38) she then specifically minimizes a feminism (which unlike the drivel by Roiphe, Summers, and Hoff) represented a major public resurgence of progressive ideas. Riot Grrrl theory argued that all forms of oppression are connected although patriarchy under girds this society. Just because something is different from her own generation does not excuse Evans from taking it seriously during the research process.      Other truly intergenerational feminist authors previously have argued the movement needs to make genuine efforts either to fully become or remain multigenerational, but Evans is blissfully oblivious to this necessity. In it's current state the book has no academic or personal redeeming quality and substantial revisions are needed to accord equal respect to all feminist generations.     
 I couldn't get into this movie. It was boring, too long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. George was annoying and he should've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo. The only thing I liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning 
 If you haven't read Adele Davis's groundbreaking work Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit, have not come across other low glycemic, whole food diets and aren't familiar with Dr. Christian Northrup's work, I suppose this book is helpful. Otherwise, I'd put my money elsewhere.  The book is written well enough and it does have alot of information. The problem is that the information has been around a long time.  Most of us are now quite familiar with the benefits of low glycemic impact, whole foods, "good" fat, etc. I don't see the value of yet another book on the subject.  One of my main problems with the work, however, is the large number of supplements (which Dr. Perricone sells, of course) that one is supposed to take in order to reap the full benefits of his "promises." While each may offer some benefit, just the logistics of taking all of them in the proper combination (some need to be taken with food, some not) at the proper time (some can't be taken after a certain time because they interfere with sleep) would daunt even the most determined.   Not to mention the expense! They can be purchased at discount stores but they're still extremely expensive.   But perhaps I'm prejudiced. I prefer books that offer information without the contamination of vested interest. This one comes across as much less informational than infomercial, heavy on the "mercial", light on the "info."  A much better choice in my opinion would be Peter D'Adamo's Eat Right 4 Your Type. Published in 1996 it's as valid today as it was 10 years ago. It's an interesting read and a good all-around book on individualized nutrition.  
 I bought this book for $3.00 at a clearance. (Should have known then). The author includes innumerable cases of "encounters", "abductions", "implants" and "sightings" but at the same time , makes disclaimers about all of them leaving you feel that he is not sincere about what he is writing and wondering why he bothered with the book. I've read that his other books are much better. This must have been one of the "lost time " episodes he describes during an abduction. This is strictly for the Mulders out there who have "I want to believe" posters on there office wall. These are all the typical alien suspicions you have already read  and left you laughing 
 Weber's book was groundbreaking when it was first published.  Even today, it is considered a classic.  However, the reader should be informed that Weber's book is full of white Germanic Christian bias, a bias so strong at  times that it harms the author's credibility.  However, if read in tandem  with later works which critique it, Weber's "Sociology of  Religion" provides a glimpse of early 20th century sociological  methodolog 
 The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio", "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic.  
 I couldn't read past the second chapter.  Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.  It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".  "Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.  I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks.  
 Mark Galli's book helps to shed light upon Jesus's character -- instead of the "warm and fuzzy" Jesus some people follow, Jesus is portrayed as "not always nice", "demanding", "fear and shame-maker", "forsaker", "desire unfulfiller"....  Galli chooses to base each chapter on a different aspect of Jesus from 1-2 verses taken from the Gospel of Mark.  Some of what Galli writes fits with the verses chosen, but more often than not found that what he writes was really out of context with the entire passage the verses came from.    Many of the chapters made me feel uncomfortable -- not because the book was doing it's job of changing my perspective of Jesus -- but rather the author's stretching of the truth.  For example, he wrote "So we struggle with Jesus in such moments because he so willing employs shame and fear and physical intimidation to motivate people."  His quote refers to Mark 11:15-17.  None of the versions of the Bible mention this scenario with Jesus actually using "shame" tactics; it's the author's own interpretation.  My main concern is that someone who takes Galli's ideas to heart will become demanding, impatient, guilt-driven, mean followers of Jesus.  And not in a good way. 
 Come on, Mark.  8 editions. Still no singers. Have Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Holiday, et al. contributed nothing to the art 
 There's not much to say.  The book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as Hamilton's Law, but no examples on its applications are put forth.  I find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook.  It also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for Campbell.   
 While it is true that Brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking.  I returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife.  I'm very tender when it comes to wildlife, and while I know that death is a natural part of the life cycle, I am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures.  For anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos, then this IS NOT the book for them.  Otherwise, I would recommend it 
 This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced.  I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card.  Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed.  Tried it with the other disc, failed again.  Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them.  Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund 
 Like many of you Argento fans, I had heard a lot about "Deep Red" and some people even considered it to be Argento's best work.  So, I just had to buy it.  However, after viewing the movie, I respectfully disagree with the opinion about "Deep Red" being Argento's best work.  While it is true that "Deep Red" is a bit more coherent with regard to plot development, the movie's atmosphere is no where near as effective as Argento's superior work in his true masterpiece named "Suspiria".  "Deep Red" is about a pianist who observes part of a murder and becomes obsessed with figuring out the identity of the murder and the mystery behind the killings.  Unfortunately, the movie drags on and on, way too long to keep one's interest consistently with respect to a typical plot development with a beginning/introduction, rising action, climax and falling action.    In "Deep Red", you have a murder in the beginning that is fairly impressive, but the subsequent murders, mystery and investigation by Marc Daly are not equally as impressive.  Unlike "Suspiria", the score and music that is utilized to create a chilling atmosphere and horror movie like theme is rather ineffective and I would argue that the movie that is played during the kills is more akin to the kind of music that is played during a trash pornographic film rather than a horror movie...the effect is damaging to the movie's ability to inspire a horror like theme within a sophisticated horror movie audience.     There is a great deal of "much ado about nothing" in the body of this movie called "Deep Red".  For that reason, the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.  There are parts of the movie that are good and there is a kind of horror like atmosphere at times, but overall, the movie works more like a mystery and suspense thriller without the thrills necessary to make it work as such.    Overall, the kills aren't that impressive (notwithstanding the first murder) really and as the movie drags on, the viewer becomes disinterested and frustrated at times.  The identity of the killer, while somewhat unexpected, is really a downer when one considers the prowess or lack thereof associated with this villain.  I agree with a previous reviewer that "Deep Red" is too long and drawn out...there are periods of time when nothing really happens and the result is a fairly dull movie.  While there are times when a horror movie like atmosphere could be argued to be present in this movie, it is nowhere near as effective as the horrifying atmosphere present in Argento's stylish "Suspiria".    In short, I highly recommend the classic "Suspiria" as Argento's true horror masterpiece over that of the dull and often insipid "Deep Red".  To be honest, TWO STARS might be a bit generous for "Deep Red" as with regard to its merits as a horror movie.  
 This is a typical Diana Palmer book in that it has the innocent girl who is wronged by the tough guy who is just misunderstood.  Ok, for some reason I keep reading Diana Palmer even when I am disappointed in her books time after time.  Honestly, it is the male characters that typically annoy me, and this was no exception.  However, I will say that Sabrina wasn't as weak-willed as some of the other heroines, but she wasn't great either.  However, this is just my personal opinion.  What annoyed me the most about the book was Colby's total attitude and behavior, especially from the past.      The best character was by far Bernadette, without her this book wouldn't have been near as good.  Anyway, if you like other Diana Palmer books, you will probably like this one.  Also, if you like books with very strong alpha characters and a "softer, more 'traditional'" woman, you will probably like this book as well 
 There isn't a fact or bit of advice in this poorly written book that you can't easily find and read on the Net for free. Written by yet another patient that thinks she can write and has something to say 
 The initial concept of the book seemed interesting but the author definately tried to hard to make it work.  I understand that she is a scholar, but some pages I just wanted to skip because it seemed as though Turnipseed was trying to impress readers with her extensive knowledge of African, American, European and Caribbean history and culture.  She stated unnecessary facts and "trivia" that was sometimes a stretch to connect with the story line.  The word choice was also confusing at times.  I had to read several passages twice or three times to understand the meaning of a sentence or paragraph that could have (and should have) been written in more simple syntax.    On a more positive note, I'm glad to witness a novel about of successful black people interacting in society.  Without all the extra hoopla, this is a love story about a black man and woman who overcome their predispositions and the expectations of others.    Turnipseed put out a decnet effort but, it was only an okay read. 
  Trashy magazine, it only focuses on sex. Like if sex is going to solve your emotional problems. This culture is so obssesed with sex. If you really want to read about relationships, I recommend "save your marriage before it starts" it gives you real info from two psychologist why marriage is going downhill and how you can save it 
 I was very disappointed with Feed Your Kids Well. This is an Atkins/Low Carbohydrate type diet that excludes most fruits and vegetables. The book is filled with list of "off limit" foods and only 6-7 time consuming recepies. All meals must be made from scratch and everyday  children should be eating eggs for breakfas! What if your child does not  like eggs?  The author is unclear on what children should be eating. His  suggestions seem unrealistic (especiall for working parents) and his  exclusion of most fruits and vegetables seems more of a "fad  diet" than a healty solution to a difficult problem many parents with  little time face 
 The common trend in this author's publications is that they devoid of most basic features of responsible writing. Although the author's intent is clearly commercial, he does not strive to earn credibility or integrity that are crucial to successful business. This book does not differ form his other book, "Relax into Stretch", yet bears the same sloppiness and emptiness of all the author's books. With large font, plenty of white space, and a hundred pages of text and figures, the book spins the same mundane drills that all yoga folks practice. Yet, this book is full of hot air. With 64 references to Russian and soviet figures and cultures, you would not find a single traceable reference other than bragging about the greatness of Russia and its research.   The book is split arbitrarily into two parts, mobility and flexibility drills, and strength  and flexibility drills. The 17 mobility drills target each joint in the body and spans more than half of the book with many Russian anecdotes that are meant to fill the white space. The photographs are not properly labeled, nor does the text describe any critical hint for throwing most of the photographs there.   The second part of the books entails compound drill such as the windmill, bridge, etc. Most of the drills lack logical description of progression or inclusion in a reasonable workout plan.     
 I was so excited when I got this book. I love stories about Presidents. However, everything in this book I had read somehwere else. Same old boring stuff. No new pictures. Basically, I thought it was awful 
 I deeply regret having lost a few hours reading this book. The first few pages can be entertaining, but later you simply can't believe how everything gets absurd and the plot becomes illogic. The scientific details are irritating because they are abundant but wrong, but the worst of all is the unbearable ethics behind the author's thoughts. Some pages seem to be written by Torquemada and the most evil catholic people that ever lived 
 Daniel Dennett's excellent book Consciousness Explained extracts a very funny cartoon from Scientific American, in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra. In the middle of the formula appears the sentence, "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS". One professor points to the statement and says to the other, "I think you should be more explicit here in step two."  Roger Penrose isn't just any old boffin: he is the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University and has been knighted for his services to Science. The Emperor's New Mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut, the Consciousness/Artificial Intelligence problem. Penrose's view is that Strong AI is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate (functionally or actually) what we know as "consciousness".  Right. Take a deep breath here. For it's a scary thing for a mere mortal (with a decidedly ordinary bachelor's degree in the humanities) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet, but I can't see any way around it: In this book Roger Penrose completely, totally, misses the point. Insofar as it's considered an entry on the Consciousness/AI debate, The Emperor's New Mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless.  There. I said it.   Then again, nearly 500 of those pages don't even purport to be about consciousness, so perhaps all is not lost. Instead, they contain an extremely dense, at times fascinating, but uniformly (and I use the word deliberately) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics, physics and cosmology. While Penrose thinks it is necessary background, it isn't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority:  One is left with the firm impression that the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is a very, very smart chap, and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes. This is no small irony, given the title of his book. For if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see, it's Roger Penrose.  Here's where I think he goes wrong. Firstly, his attempt to undermine the AI position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning. Pure mathematics is a closed logical system. Its truths aren't falsifiable, so by themselves have no explanatory force. Mathematical statements (such as "1+1=2") are necessarily true for all time and all universes so, ipso facto, they can't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe. Yet that is just what Penrose asks them to do. He invokes Gdel's theorem of undecidability, perhaps to counter the argument I have just made, but it isn't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set (even though you know they are true) is very different from being able to falsify them. Without that power, you have no explanatory traction in the outside world.  Penrose's entire attack on Strong AI is based on an unfalsifiable, and therefore non-content carrying, argument.  Another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used, and must work perfectly to be of any use. Natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case. An algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products, and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level: take Newtonian mechanics as a good example. We've known for a century it isn't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine.   Which brings me to my next point: for all the learning Penrose includes on Mandelbrot sets, phase space, entropy and Hawking Radiation, The Emperor's New Mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out: The bibliography contains no reference to Karl Popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/AI question: Daniel Dennett is barely mentioned (Dennett's writing probably represents the "forefront" of the consciousness debate), nor is Richard Dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection. Indeed, Penrose doesn't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong AI, but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day, and that AI doesn't present a significant challenge. Douglas Hofstadter is given a little space, and John Searle and his largely discredited Chinese Room Experiment a fair space, but other than that the only philosopher Penrose seems to be aware of is Plato.  Another thinker Penrose doesn't seem familiar with is William of Occam. Instead of doing some background reading (and applying a little common sense), Penrose has launched a theory which (as he proudly proclaims) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain (in ways he freely admits he doesn't understand) an everyday, prosaic (but still extremely hard to grasp) phenomenon. In its interstellar journey Penrose's theory drifts very close to dualism, and close (but not quite so close, perhaps) to positing (or needing) some sort of God to work. That will give succour in some quarters, but not the ones Penrose has in mind, I suspect.   Occam's Razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available. Penrose would protest there are none; Dennett, Dawkins, Hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents (including me) would beg to differ, and point to a lot of literature that Penrose hasn't read. In any case one would think that Penrose's own intuition (which he claims helps him to see truth despite Gdel undecidability!) ought to help him see his theory is, as Jeremy Bentham would say, "nonsense on stilts".   Ultimately, when Penrose says "quantum theory explains consciousness" he is really saying no more than "something magic happens!" or even "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS".  Mr Penrose, I think you should be more explicit here in step two.  Olly Buxton 
 Overly confusing and limited to really one system - Stargate. The book reads like an amateur wrote it. Perhaps the author knows what he is doing, but he relates it poorly to those of us who want to be shown what to do and don't have the kind of knowledge it takes just to decipher it. 
 This book was disappointing.  It's title lead me to believe that it would be an extensive and thorough compilation of most, if not all of the bikes Schwinn produced;  not so!    I own a 1970 Schwinn Twinn Tandem bike, and was hoping I would read and see information on tandems.  They picture one tandem, and have very little information about it.   They also fail to depict several other models.  If you look at an orignal Schwinn catalog,  you'll find that they built dozens of models each year!   Do a google search and you'll find it.    One of Schwinn's more popular models was the "Typhoon", and I don't even see a mention of it!   What a crock!  I have a Standard Catalog of Corvette, and it's is much more thorough than this one for the bike.   
 The reviews listed on Amazon don't begin to address the fact that for most historians, and those living during the 1930's and 1940's, Harry Hopkins was Roosevelt's right hand man, and after reading the 1987 biography of Hopkins, it's very easy to come to the unestablished but logical analysis that it was all about Harry from 1935 when Roosevelt was elected until 1946 when Truman came into office. The attempt to discredit Hopkins or write him out of history is a big mistake, and the entire history needs to be done again with a view toward his very large role to prove or disprove the 1987 biography which doesn't say so, but doesn't have to say so, that Roosevelt would have been nowhere without the efforts of this close friend, inhabitant of the White House, negotiator, New Dealer, and operations genius behind the Roosevelt throne 
 I have a friend who loved this book...but, for me, anyone who suggests hot dogs and Splenda in a diet book is off my list 
 I read this book this last year in highschool for English class.  It was awful!  First of all it's really confusing and second of all it's just a stupid plot and ending.  It was so boring and so long.  Don't read it it's a waste of time 
 This set up is a bit flimsy and the tunnels don't have anything to connect them to the tent. My son still loves it but I wish it was a bit more sturdy 
 If you're looking for a "what's new in SQL Server 2005" this book covers that.  If you're looking for a reference book on the product, that goes into how to configure or upgrade from an earlier version--Keep Looking.  The book explains new features in some detail.  But, I want to know how to place the databases in a specific directory, how to set up replication--not mirroring; and how to install the software remotely.  The book does not discuss any of that 
 If you like the fact that his instructions on how to grow anorange tree start with "Purchase an orange variety adapted toyour area" then this book might be what you're looking for. I don't know why Mr W chose to ignore the fact that orange trees can be grown from seed or from cuttings, but he did. I wrote ehow about this two months ago and still they have not addressed the issue. I guess Mr. W has nothing to say on the subject. If his ehow is any indication, I suspect this book will contain likewise unhelpful information for those who wish to grow plants from seed or cuttings, rather than line the pockets of the nearest lawn & garden store owner 
 I thought that this book would be more interactive. Better (and more creative) to draw your own family tree 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 Spongebob IS  making an obscene gesture.  Personally, I don't think it is an appropriate toy for children.  Anyone that thinks Spongebob is merely "pointing" a finger shouldn't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society!! 
 I was truly annoyed by his random writing style and the book's lousy layout. Look at the cover---the inside is just as chaotic. I bailed after 15 pages or so. Too bad, as  he has some good things to say, but it wasn't worth the effort. As a design advocate I'm amazed that his book designs are so ineffective and shoddy. He loves design but not graphic design?.. 
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 ...and unfortunately, this book is shallow as well. Arnoldi's book deals with surfaces and appearances, and she makes a good point from it. The characters are shallow people who destroy their self-indulgent lives.   However, it's a bit too shallow for me. The sexual perversity was probably meant to spice things up, but, oddly enough, it didn't. We're given a throwaway reason for Charles' behaviour (mommy didn't pay enough attention to him) and a laundry list of reasons why he's a weasel. There was no connection, though. I didn't loathe him or find him disgusting or sad...I didn't find anything there at all. He was as thin as cardboard. So was Aurora. They could have used some of the detail that she used on Amy (the daughter) and her old trainer.   The ending was amusing, and it would have been satisfying had there been any depth. I found myself held off by shiny surfaces. This may have been thematically intentional, but it doesn't make for a good read.   I finished it, but wouldn't read it twice. 
 HAHAHA you have to take a look at that  it's the lowest budget film in the history of film 
 This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled 
 who feels this way about this CD.  When I first bought it I bought it because I liked the song "If You See Him" which I had heard on the radio and I thought that maybe Reba had come back to recording country music.  Boy was I wrong!!  The rest of the CD gave me a headache with such pop tunes as "One Honest Heart" and "Invisible".  I think this is my least favorite of all of Reba's albums which I continue to buy whenever a new one is released in the hopes that Reba has gotten rich enough now to where she can go back to the real country music that made her a name and not this pop stuff which I can't stand anymore.  
 I am new to the world of DSLR photography, and searched various internet sites for books that would give me a good introduction to this.  I am happy with the basic layout of the information in this book, yet not so happy with the "quality" of the book.    While it was in a spiral notebook form which I thought would bring ease in studying, all the photographs were in black and white due to the book appearing to be a reproduction.  If you are looking for an instruction manual that has black and white photos, this is for you.  I have since bought Digital Photography for Dummies, which is a great book.  Easily laid out information, as well as "color" photographs 
 Movie Boring... Story Drags... barely any action... if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing... booo 
 I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre.  In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner... 
 This direct to video "sequel" is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler, and another of the countless, and pointless, direct to video sequels to come from Sony/Comlumbia/Tri-Star as of late (Cruel Intentions 2 & 3, Starship Troopers 2, shall I go on?).  Wild Things 2 focuses around a rich girl (Susan Ward) whose stepfather mysteriously dies, and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival (Son of the Beach's hot Leila Arcieri) who claims to be the man's true, biological daughter.  Naturally, just like in the original, there are plot twists aplenty, as learned by an insurance investigator (Isiah Washington, giving a somewhat inspired performance), and naturally, there are double crosses, murders, and a redux of the first film's threesome, only it's not as erotic as the original's.  Wild Things 2 isn't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it's good points, it's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate.  Is it worth seeing?  Depends how much you liked the first Wild Things, but for the rest of us, just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 Este album es menos que basura. Las letras de las canciones no tienen sentido y la música suena horrible. Estos pseudo raperos no tienen idea de lo que es verdadero rap. Son unos pobres diablos imitadores de Cypress Hill, que no tienen nada importante que decir. No pierdas tu tiempo, ni mucho menos tu dinero, en este album que no vale ni un centavo 
 "Welcome to the BSC, Abby" is a fairly good book, but not one you'd want to read over and over again. Abby's the newest sitter in the series, and it will be difficult for her to have a fan base, especially since she replaced Dawn. I don't think it was exactly smart of Ann M. Martin to introduce a new character so late in the series. However, I think Abby is the most realistic characters of the series, and it is her first book, so if you're a fan, it might be a good idea to check it out 
 This book was my first and last that I will read from Shannon Drake.  It  was so boring 
 I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months.  While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture.  For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 The magic of the first 2 seasons of Happy Days was the opening of "Rock Around The Clock" and all the great rock and roll songs of the fifties. Season 2 has been totally altered and the excitement is lost. Shame on Paramount for dumping the great music in favor of generic instrumentals. What an injustice to a great TV show. The video quality for the first episode of the season is awful and the fact that it's out of sequence just makes it even worse. Granted, it may have aired this way, but why not correct the sequence on the DVD? This DVD set is truly a disappointment, especially after the excellent job they did with Season 1. Don't waste your money. Maybe Paramount will pull all these inferior DVD sets and re-release Season 2 the way it really was 
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!   
 This book is good if you want some minor facts that have been exhaustively researched.  I bought my copy in May of 2002.  It makes it seem that the movies are junk and you are wasting your time. A better Bond book is The Essential Bond, by Lee Pfeiffer. This one tells you about gadgets, cars, villians, and the sexy Bond girls.  I rate this one 5 stars! 
 Tom Fenton was a reporter for a broadcast network for four decades, covering Europe and the Middle East. He says much of America depends on the network broadcasters for news about the world. [No mention of news about America.] Since the fall of the Soviet Union networks drastically cut back on foreign news, replacing it with sensationalistic and meaningless news. Fenton doesn't understand the purpose of this: to keep citizens ignorant of the events whether in Washington or in foreign lands. People who know little, like children, are easier to manipulate and exploit. The owners of a network can do as they please, and they please the Government that controls their money-making machine. Do Clinton and Bush really want the American people to know what they're doing overseas? Don't broadcasters want a larger audience, no matter what? Fenton is arguing for a system that would reduce profits and the credibility of the US Government, and that won't happen soon. If Fenton were serious, he would recommend short-wave radio to hear foreign broadcasts in English. But that has its drawbacks. A good solution would be a weekly newspaper devoted to foreign news. But who would own and control it? Was the foreign news broadcast back in the 1970s and 1980s all that great?  The bottom line is this: do the networks, and the Govt., really want us to know there were no "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq? That the 1989 invasion of Panama was not needed for America?That "globalization" is a fraud to impoverish the American people? That Reagan and Bush I supported Osama Bin Ladin?  The American public was not informed ahead of time for many big stories (p.3). This is by design of the networks (p.4). The real truth is that most Americans will not waste their time listening to "talking heads" in a foreign land unless it is relevant. And that eliminates most of the background news that Fenton would want broadcast. You could ask how much of this news is shown on British, French, German, or Italian TV. Could it be that the American voter is irrelevant in a system of fixed and rigged elections, where the Corporations and the President do as they wish? Why did it take so long for the media to break the story of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (p.10)? Has outsourcing damaged the credibility of TV news (p.12)?  There is no entry in the index for "Westmoreland". After CBS successfully defended itself against the General, it was sold to new owners. What changes did they make? [See pages 71-72.] Did the FBI fail to follow up the connections to the 1993 WTC attack (p.21)?. Are the network news the equivalent of junk food (p.22)? Was there really "a massive and damaging cutback in military and intelligence funding" (p.27)? Fenton summarizes the events in Russia on page 30; was this so reported on TV? Fenton says America last saw the horrors of war in 1814; he had overlooked the Civil War, the Indian Wars, even the incursion into 1916 Texas. Fenton uses "60 Minutes" as a showpiece; but you should know that the questions asked are often created in editing to add drama to the subject's answers! Fenton tells about foreign bureaus (p.65), but not of their work product. The events noted on page 81 can be best covered in a magazine article, not in a few minutes of TV. Chapter 4 documents the use and abuse of the press (p.97). Does the rest of the world get better news (Chapter 5)? "Voices Inside the Industry" say the reporting of world news is inadequate (p.143). Chapter 7 says we know little of what our Govt. is doing around the world, and its not in the nightly news. Censorship of foreign news is Washington's policy (pp.207-213). What can be done?  Chapter 9 has his "Solutions". Like other special-interest pleaders, he claims that what benefits him is good for the country. My experience is that 30 minutes with your local newspaper will tell you more than TV news. Your results may vary.  
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 'The Egypt Game' is one of the best books I've ever read. So naturally, I was anxious to see what was next for the kids. If anyone knows their pop music history, this is like 'Bad' following 'Thriller'. It just isn't in the same class as its predecessor. It took the author about 30 years to release this "book", and the time span is painfully obvious. It's like looking at different people. And this whole deal with Toby running away? And when do they ever play the game? My edition of 'The Egypt Game' gives two sample chapters from the Gypsy game, and it looked good to me. I was sorely disappointed. This book places with 'Gigli', 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones', and 'Bad' as one of the most pointless pieces of garbage on the face of this Earth!!! But judge for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 The book provides believable and sometimes fascinating information, and the author is to be commended for getting this hard-sell published. But the writing is stilted and surprisingly flat considering the writer is a professional music journalist with a growing list of book credits.   If the reader is looking for evangelical fervor - and a writing style that can inspire - they will not find it here.   As is always advisable to those who do seek to turn someone on to music - give that person the music of Big Star. Don't give them this book. 
 to try and re create NWA with the west coast best is a good idea but it cant be done. The sound of NWA was so raw loud and straight ghetto that this remake serves as a sorry re mak 
 Isn't this illegal or something?  To write a mystery (or anything for that matter) that simply has no ending? I don't think I've ever encountered anything quite like this before!  It's not that it's left up to the reader's imagination or anything like that.  The book just ends! No resolution of any kind.  Like there were pages torn out! Even if a story is to be continued in the next book of a series, fine but there has to be some explanation for the characters' actions and some kind of ending in order for the reader to be encouraged to come back for the rest of the story.  I actually quite enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book and assumed, stupidly I guess, that the author would pretty much tie things up so it was such a disappointment and actually downright insulting to find that the author simply doesn't care in the least about her readers. At the very least, the author and the reader have a silent understanding that the reader will be willing to excuse some errors or idiosyncratic writing or loose ends so long as the author provides the reader with a work that is sincere, entertaining and professional. I did my part. I paid my 10 bucks for the book, I read it until the very end and then the author let me down.  Not just because I didn't like the ending.  But because the author showed such disrespect for me, the reader, that she didn't even bother with an ending! I will never read another of Ms. Grimes books ever again.  What a cheat 
 I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth 
 There's really not much reason to buy this album.  A year before this was released, Mannheim released an album called "Halloween," which was a two-disc set, with one disc featuring music (mostly Mannheim arrangements of "scary" classical pieces like "Hall Of The Mountain King," plus a few rehases of old Fresh Aire tunes), and the other disc featured spooky sound effects.  "Monster Mix" takes samplings from that two-disc set and gives you the abridged version on one disc for a couple of dollars less.  They also threw in "Full Moon", which was first released on their "Ambience Series" album, "Autumn Song."  Incidentally, I like their "Autumn Song" album quite a bit better than either "Halloween" or "Monster Mix," but you can only get it directly through Mannheim's official website.  For those who aren't familiar with the tracks on this disc-- some of the tracks are decent, though none reached the quality of music that Mannheim put out back in the late 80s/early 90s.  Synthesizers always played a heavy role in Mannheim's music, but here, they get a bit overbearing and everything starts to sound a bit cheap and over-quantized (in other words, it all feels like it was machine generated-- which, I suppose, it was.)    Still, if you like the Steamroller sound, and you want to hear them attempt a holiday other than Christmas, you may find this interesting for a couple of listens.  But then, just pay the extra dollar or two and get the full double-disc set called "Halloween."  Better yet, go to their website (mannheimsteamroller.com) and try "Autumn Song."            
 I found this book rather...well...lame.  To me, and this is just me, the information was nothing that you could not find on most basic websites.  I would look elsewhere 
 I understand why it works because I am very familiar with other low carb diets and I understand the insulin and all the other stuff, but what confuses me big time is the thing about zone blocks and measurements. That totally throws it all off for me. If I could only understand it. It sounds like a great diet and I'm sure it is, but it's too complicated to understand for most people.. 
 To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering.  
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 We bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed.  Because it is tall and narrow, once a few blocks are in it, it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already.  This was a frustrating, not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 I didn't understand it, don't know what it's about and frankly i don't care. what are people thinking when they make tripe like this. what a waste 
 What a disappointment!   This book only covers one discipline, history, ignoring the footnote through other areas of scholarship. The writing is tedious and laboured. The author has loaded it with massive footnotes himself, many of which contain large untranslated quotations. The author arrogantly assumes we can all speak German, Latin and Italian.  How this mess ever escaped from the oblivion of academia it so richly deserves is beyond me 
 This book is impossible, complicated, and confusing. Good luck to anyone who tries to figure it out.  Zizek careens through film history, haphazardly - and sometimes carefully - appropriating examples in order to make various 'post-modern' and Lacanian points. It almost seems like parody, but ... it's not 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 My problem with Rebel Angels is mostly the incredible unlikeability of the main characters. Gemma comes across as incredibly stupid, or just someone who will easily cave if you apply a little peer pressure. She continues to make stupid decisions, just because her friends whine and complain or give her dirty looks. It's like the cheesy horror films where the whole audience is yelling "Don't go in there!" and the ditsy heroine does just that. Also, Gemma is just TOO realistic as a young lady of the Victorian era. Although maybe not as much as her friends, she is still preoccupied with being among the upper class and having a good reputation. She shows nearly no compassion to the unfortunate people she comes across. This especially bothered me when she met Nell Hawkins. At the end of the book, Gemma's character improves, but by then it was too late to salvage what I thought of the book.  The only character I liked at all was Kartik. He was the only relatable character in the entire book. And he was barely included in the story at all. Gemma treated him horribly, even when she didn't mean to. The closure concerning Gemma and Kartik was also horribly done.   Also, the plot was terribly predictable. The only reason I kept reading was for the rushed descriptions of the scenery of the realms. And the hope that Kartik would make a spectacular entrance and sweep Gemma off her feet.  Overall, it was a poorly done follow-up. And that's saying something considering that I didn't like A Great and Terrible Beauty either 
 For the few examples of exponential growth, most notably Moore's Law, there are 10 (battery life, transportation speed, food production per acre, life span, etc) of areas that we have devoted a great deal of effort towards improving without exponential returns.  While this book presents some interesting points it is little more than psuedo science.  Perhaps Kurzweil's most important conclusion, that we are nothing more than biological computers, is the most scary.  The conclusion of this, that he does not raise, is that there is no free will.  Maybe he is correct, I doubt it though 
 I've owned this cookbook for years.  A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism.  There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible.  Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture.  This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests.  I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy 
 ...and I suppose that's what I get for judging it by its cover. I expected the book to be funny bordering on side-splitting since Peck has been compared to Erma Bombeck. But where Bombeck was hilariously wise and self-deprecating without groveling, it's hard to believe Peck is in her 50s. While reading I kept picturing a kid with a copy of "Increase Your Vocabulary Overnight!" trying too hard to be funny -- her writing is often irritatingly choppy and even worse, contrived.   Apparently the book was originally written just for the amusement of family and friends, and perhaps I am being unfair by virtue of my own high expectations. But more often than not, Peck's stories fall flat into that stale silence immediately following what *you* thought was funny, yet wind up red-faced and mumbling, "Well, guess you had to be there... 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 Utter nonsense. How else does one describe this?   A few erudite critics have already pointed out that with which I concur and on which will elaborate slightly: The "math" that's used is set up to find the answer the author desires. The elaboration: You could also find a similar "code" in anything, including, say, the US Constitution, or--hence my title--"Winnie."  This is a classic example of we humans trying desperately to find a pattern where none exist. Don't waste your time with this foolishness 
 This was the required book for the Databases class at the University of Utah Computer Science department. It is a good book if you want to learn the theory behind databases. If you want to actually learn about practical information then pickup "The Practical SQL Handbook" by Bowman and others.  Also note that the E-R diagrams Silberschatz uses is not widely used. I found the book to be poorly written. Buy this book only if you need it for school 
 My 3 dogs recently start fighting and was frantic about what to do since they live inside with me 24/7. I had fights that landed one of my dogs in the ER room so this was a serious problem. I  have obedience trained all my dogs so I am not a novice. I   heard this author on the local radio station where I live and thought his book may be helpful. It was not. It is very basic stuff I already knew. I found Patricia McConnell, PH.D.'s 30 page pamphlett "The Cautious Canine"to be much more helpful than this author's 230 page book. If your problem is strickly aggression and or fearful shy dogs then this book does not address enough detail about what to do.  I think it may be a good book for any new or inexperienced dog owner that covers basics. I have since restored peace in my house with some new ground rules and appointing the right dog to alpha status so it can be done 
 A highly informative book about viruses, how and why they are spread, in some cases their epidemiology and much about their evolution. Thankfully, very little is given over to speculation here, at least as compared to other books I've read on the subject.  The information in this book is offered in a completely straightforward (and sometimes very boring) way.  You will learn some fascinating new facts, but not have to suffer through scare tactics, just a yawn or two. The book put me to sleep a few times, but was still worth the read. The book contains some interesting viral history and global implications to ponder as well. No entertainment here though, it's just the facts 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.  It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.  The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch.  Not a favourite 
 They are messy when they opened. I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much. I don't have much room in my freezer. when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate... it's like $17 for ten :- 
 This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?   The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't 
 I was so disappointed in Theresa Sokyrka's First Album these old charms. I was looking forward in her audition song Gob Bless the Child and purchased this CD just to hear her sing like she sang it in her audition.   What a let down.  Theresa decided to play it safe on this CD and did not let loose.  No emotions. Just another voice and bland at that 
 after the scary and funny "return of the living dead" i couldn't wait to see this one,know what? turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the PITS!!!!!!!! how could they have blown this movie so bad!! not funny,not scary,and not worth the price!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!! 
 Even though I am not a Sophia Loren fan, I thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these 3 different short stories about 3 totally different women. Anyone born before 1940 should enjoy them as well 
 The last image of a grown man in his near to dead mother's lap is more than a little disturbing.  Gets an E for effort.  I know what they were trying to do, but really, it comes off as a bit disturbing, Oedipal even 
 I thought I had never met a book on statistics I didn't like (i.e., find something useful therein), until I met this book. I bought it in spite of other reviews that mentioned glaring errors that had not been fixed. I felt I knew enough about statistics to fix the errors, and I was interested primarily in the application of statistics to toxicology, for which topic few good texts exist. However, I could never have imagined the monumental scale of the corrections needed.  In this book (supposedly in its 3rd edition), in my opinion there is essentially NOTHING in the text without errors and omissions, except possibly the SAS programs given, which are possibly useful to the neophyte in SAS. Formulae are unintelligible, missing parentheses and using improper symbols and typesetting. Symbols are referenced that are never defined, etc. Apparently the author just created a montage of clips from other works without regard to antecedent explanation and had zero concern for correctness (he should be ashamed).   Finally, in my opinion, the author does not appear from his writings to be the expert in the field that one would expect from the book title. He does appear to be a toxicologist, but his knowledge of statistics appears rudimentary and confused.  I was truly disappointed by this book, because my needs remain unsatisfied. Its true value lies solely in the table of contents (so you can look up elsewhere the techniques referenced) and the SAS program snippets. Everything else is untrustworthy, incomplete and generally contaminated by errors. If the author cared the least bit about accuracy and content, he could have made his book enormously more useful in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition. The eternal optimist may hope for this in the 4th edition 
 Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 Disclosure: I was sent a free advance copy of this book to review by publisher based on previous reviews I had written on Amazon.  This is a curious book with an intriguing premise: we should look to our evolutionary history to evaluate what traits in our societal organisation have been successful and, to the extent we think our current society is not working, cure the defects by realigning with our evolutionary history - going back to what time has shown to be "good evolutionary tricks".  Those, in Gilbert's view, include redefining (for which read "abandoning") modern feminism; toughening the divorce laws and generally promoting and sanctifying heterosexual marriage and motherhood as the fulcrum of our social arrangements; promoting the extended family; and fostering our "kinship and ethnic roots", whatever that might mean.  Those values, stated baldly, read rather like a How To Live A Godly Life handbook from some sort of evangelical religious organisation - which, in itself, is fine, if that's your bag - but for those like me who hold evangelical religious organisations in pretty low regard, largely because they tend to espouse those sorts of views without good foundation, it makes the Darwin argument - which would appear to be just such a good foundation - a very interesting one indeed. I hold the theory of evolution in pretty high regard, so I figured this book might represent some sort of a midlife crisis.  But no such luck: it is apparent early on that Gilbert's underlying argument is obviously flawed - so much so that for much of the book I was expecting a knock-out punch from an unexpected quarter. It never came: as William C. Scheel adeptly puts it in a review below, "Gilbert flunks the fundamentals of Darwinism".  Here is the fallacy: Evolution describes a blind algorithmic process, in which through the process of natural selection, favours those organisms which happen, through accident or design, to be better suited *to the prevailing conditions* through time - and which successfully reproduce more quickly. Evolution is "path-dependent": we've got where we are through a collossal concatenation of contingencies, and where we're going from here is no different. Just like the stock market, "past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The value of your investment may go up or down". Words, curiously, that Gilbert's fictional financial adviser never bothers to mention (inexplicably, Gilbert has invented a financial adviser who leaves putatively "witty" voicemails throughout the course of this book, to no apparent point).  According to Gilbert, when presented with an uncertain future, we should look to our past - and not even our recent past, but our ancient past, when Homo Sapiens first descended from the trees and encroached on the Savannah - to determine how to act.  But we are not in the Savannah any more. We have houses, and cars and witty financial advisers who leave us voicemails. We live in the age of the internet; technology is progressing geometrically to the point where our social environment is barely recognisable from that 100, let alone 1,000,000, years ago, and that environment includes not just artefacts like phones, cars, planes and computers, but intellectual concepts - "memes" - like feminism, political correctness and homosexual marriage.   Good adaptive tricks learned in the Savannah *may* work in this wildly different environment, by some lucky hap, but expecting them to - prescribing them for everyone - is as much of a folly as expecting the Dodo to deal with the arrival of humans on Mauritius by sitting ever more tightly on its egg.  In actual fact, evolutionary prescription will be this: all of us, in society, are trying to make our way as best we can. We all adopt slightly different strategies. Some will work better (in this environment, now) than others. Those that work best will flourish. Only time will tell. And THAT'S IT. That's all we can say: to go any further turns an observing biologist into a social engineer - a breed which, ironically, Gilbert spends the last half of the book railing against.  This book will give succour to those who share the author's traditionalist views and would like to believe it gives them a sounder footing that simply their own personal preferences, but it will irritate those who don't, and leave those with a taste for a good vigorous argument about the merits of the philosophical argument a little disappointed.

 The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first.  Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch.  These are not cushions with a black cover.  This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp.  The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint.  Don't buy this.  Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier. 
 Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here. 
 Characteristic of this reader is the bothersome overlap of topics. It dramatically fails to give insight in theories of globalization itself and the link between these theories and global reality. After studying this reader even experienced students of Anthropology will give anything for something that is less grandiloquent and more useful because of it's simplicity 
 Hurrah for "sustainability" and "biodiversity"! Down with the human race 
 I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality 
 Mean Jean may rule the playground with an iron fist, but it takes newcomer Katie-Sue to stand up to her by taking the offensive - offering to jump rope with her. All well and good, but it does not really address the very real issue of playground tyranny. Not all bullies are amenable to overtures on the part of their peers and Katie-Sue seems an overdrawn literary ploy. I did not like the illustrations, finding them overly large and the colors gaudy and garish. I didn't like the way the characters were drawn at all and found them physically unappealling.  Mean Jean was especially unappealling with her oversized head and perpetual sneer.  I also disliked the nonsense rhymes, e.g. "lollapaloosh," "kitz and kajammer." What saved this from receiving a one-star review was the good faith effort to tackle the issue of playground despots.   "The Playground King" by Naylor, et al. is vastly superior to this book.  However, this is a good effort 
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 BEWARE - Amazon lists this cover with the Weber Performer grill.  It does NOT fit the 2006 Performer and should NOT be purchased together 
 The Gnostic Gospels is mainly a summary of what the gnostics believed about various subjects, such as the resurrection of Jesus, salvation, martyrdom, and spiritual maturity. Throughout the book Pagels compares the gnostics with "the orthodox," whom she interprets as the catholic church in the late first and early second century. Pagels is well informed on the topic and an engaging writer. However, while Pagels claims to be interested in Christianity and not promoting one view over the other (p.150-151), the focus of her book and her conclusions indicate otherwise. Though her analysis of the gnostics is thorough, there are some problems with her interpretations of the New Testament writers.   Her treatment of the resurrection of Christ is most critical. She is right to acknowledge that Christianity considers this to be "one unique historical moment" (p.3). Yet she portrays the New Testament writers as giving different views of Jesus' resurrection. In her opinion, some insist on a bodily resurrection while others indicate a "spirit" resurrection. This is simply not the case. The gospels and Paul emphasize the bodily resurrection throughout their writings.   According to Pagels, Mark and Luke report that Jesus appeared "in another form," meaning something other than a human body. Luke 24:16 says that two disciples were kept from recognizing who Jesus was at first. But this does not prove that Jesus' appearance was something other than human, rather something was done to the disciples to keep them from truly seeing him. Later in the passage it says that "their eyes were opened and they recognized him" (24:31), not that Jesus' appearance changed. Only Mark uses the phrase "in another form" in a passage which does not appear in the earliest manuscripts. Mark 16:12-13 is a brief summary of the events Luke describes in more detail (Luke 24:13-35). Given these facts, it seems warranted to interpret Mark in light of Luke and not the other way around.  She also uses the incident with Mary in John 20:11-17 as another example of a gospel writer describing something other than a bodily resurrection. Pagels states that Jesus commanded Mary not to touch him. However, the Revised Standard Version (which Pagels uses) does not say this. Jesus actually says, "Do not hold me," (New Revised reads, "Do not hold on to me"). She was clinging to him and Jesus was telling her to let go because he wanted her to report to the other disciples.  Other passages Pagels sites are the two accounts of Paul's conversion recorded by Luke (Acts 9:3-9; Acts 22:6-11). "One could suggest that certain people, in moments of great emotional stress, suddenly felt that they experienced Jesus' presence. Paul's experience can be read this way" (p.6). But this does not make any sense for Paul. He was not under "great emotional stress;" the Christians he was hunting down and persecuting were the ones under stress. Paul was imprisoning the people who believed Jesus was the Son of God, so he had no predisposition to have hallucinations of Jesus.  Pagels notes the apparent contradiction in the two passages mentioned above in reporting the incident with Paul. However, in both reports the men with Paul did not see a person as Paul did. As far as the voice, Acts 9 says that they "heard the voice" and in Acts 22 Paul says they "did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me." Acts 9 does not claim that they actually heard what was said to Paul, which is the point Paul is trying to make in Acts 22. Paul's companions heard and saw something indistinguishable, so they were not able to give testimony as to what or who it was. Paul's dramatic life change is best explained by the fact that he did encounter someone on the road to Damascus. Would Paul, a learned Jewish leader, be willing to be persecuted, imprisoned, ostracized, and executed for something he hallucinated or for a feeling of Jesus' presence?   Finally, Pagels' treatment of Paul's writings on the resurrection greatly misrepresents his view. She intreprets Paul as contradicting himself within a few paragraphs. In 1 Corinthians 15 he both claims that there is a resurrection of the body and that the physical body is raised to a spiritual body. But he is not meaning that the resurrection is that of a disembodied soul when he uses the term "spiritual." This is clearer after reading 1 Corinthians 2 where Paul compares the natural man with the spiritual man. Here he is obviously not refering to one man with a body and one man without. The spiritual person is one who has been filled and enlivened by the Spirit of God (1 Cor.2:11-16). Therefore, when Paul says that Christians will have a spiritual body, it is not a contradiction in terms or a belief in a mere raising of the soul after death. Paul is meaning that the believer will experience a resurrection of a new kind of body; a body that is not prone to decay or death, but will be imperishable and enlivened by God's Spirit to the fullest. Many might disagree with Paul or the gospel writers concerning the resurrection of Jesus, but that does not imply that they did not believe what they wrote or that they were inconsistent in their beliefs. 
 This book would have been fine had it been published 20 years ago before the saturation of critical theory. Now it just feels like a wounded discourse from someone who went to grad school in the 60's 
 Ok, this was the last Jacksons lp and I don't understand why this was their best selling, compared to the gem Destiny and super giant Truimph.  My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab "State of Shock" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  "Torture" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  "Body" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster "The Hurt."  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it. 
 Thank goodness I just checked this book out of the library and didn't buy it!  This book barely provides one helpful strategy, and instead is more about theories and case studies.  In the foreward she mentions that this book is best read BEFORE you have a second child.  Well, I have a feeling most people are not that proactive, and instead start looking for help once their kids start fighting and really struggling with sibling rivalry.  Skip this book and find another one!  
 I think fans have to be honest about Hotel: It is a disappointing effort. The album begins with great promise. The intro is an excellent, subtle, synth piece. It suits the sterile, soft colours used in the cd art. From there the album drops off. Moby isn't much of a guitar player-so a near whole album of "post-punk"-ish pop tunes is hard to enjoy. "I like it" is particularly bad. There are some bright spots. "Raining Again" and "Lift Me up" are passable. The cover of New Order's "Temptation" with singer Dawn is actually fairly good. The album ends well with some nice ambient compositions. "Homeward Angel" is excellent.  If you can find a copy with the bonus ambient cd, buy it. The second disc is unapologetically electronic, slow, long, and beautiful. It is one for the fans and more than makes up for the short-comings of the first disc 
 Stay away from this phone.  The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired. Picking up my last i530. If this one goes, Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier. I've had it! Nextel and Motorola can't figure out that this phone is JUNK 
 I thought that the music quality was fine, but the music did not sound the same as the music in the original soundtracks.  John Williams does not conduct his songs on these CD's. I could hear differences between songs I allready own and songs on these CD's. It seemed like the conductor on these CD's interpreted the music differently and therefore the music did not sound the same. I did not like that I could hear the difference between the original soundtracks and the songs on these CD's. I also found an error with one of the song names.  Instead of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, one of the song names was Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. I would definitely recomend the original soundtracks over this set of CD's.  
 I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this 
 Maybe if you're a preteen, you'd find this stuff funny but, for the most part, what is presented as humor isn't.  It must be the Brits are really starved for laughs since Monty Python left the air if they think this is funny.  I'd give it zero stars, if that were an option.  Save your money 
 LIBERAL Business Ethics...  What an oxymoron, if liberals ran businesses it'll soon turn to Socialist and collapse.  No wonder our economy isn't doing too well, they're run by Leftist rebels.  This book just highjacks the teachings of basic philosophy ethics 101.  I wouldn't recommend this book.  I would recommend something else if it does exist.  Then again these college books are propaganda machines that destroy the minds of intelligent students (especially foreign students) who later take on top positions in their countries that further fuel anti-Americanism, thus creating more problems in the world 
 I was totally disappointed in this book.  Totally predicatable. Major disappointment! 
 This planner is pretty poorly organized.  For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4.  Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2.  It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way?  There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before.  However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far.  There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent.  It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner 
 Although this book was recommended to me by a professional I must say that I was terribly disappointed. Out of the entire book the only part I actually did agree with was that in general a lot of us treat dogs as humans when they really should be treated like the animals that they are.   With that in mind, Donaldson believes dogs to be quite stupid and not capable of working for anything other than food. I have had and trained dogs for years and have never had to result to such pandering. Dog's are extremely intelligent and can be taught anything without giving a treat every few seconds. (She even suggests using cut up hot dogs to 'motivate' your dog. Those hot dogs with all the perservatives and additives are going to do more damage to the dog than whatever the behavior is worth.)  She focuses an inordinate amount of time to teaching a dog to fetch saying that this one move will solve most other problems. I can't disagree more. The things that works best for dogs is exercise and strong leadership. Besides, some breeds are generally not interested in playing fetch but rather doing the activites for which is bred in the first place.  Also, Donaldson tries to refute Pack Theory, which takes into account the fact that dogs evolved from wolves and hence have a strict social hierarchy, by showing her own ignorance on the subject. In her view she only sees dominance as being cruel and punishing your dog into submission. When in reality it alleviates the need for punishing since your dog will do what you say because he knows that you are the boss.  Throughout the book she contradicts herself constantly on her own points. This shows me that she does not have a great deal of self examination of her own information and that it isn't worth much.  I believe that her book does very little to help people with dogs that have any issues whatsoever.   I recommend Cesar Milan's book and his approach. I have used several of his techniques with no damage to my dog, as Donaldson would have you believe, and I got the results that I wanted.   Do not buy Culture Clash as it is really only good for being recycled. 
 We've used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud. We thought because it was old.  So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem.  It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it.  The hose was shaking vigorously.  Without trying a second time, I returned it to the store the next day 
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
 I was very disapointed that the cards were not the most current. With the publication date of October 2002, and this coinciding with the release of Onslaught, I thought it would be included. My disapointment increased 10 fold when I found out that Oddyssey, Judgment, and Torment were also missing from the book. I don't understand how one can say complete! and have the buyer expect anything less than the inclusion of the Oddyssey series 
 I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again. 
 I had expected more from this book. I was drawn in by the premise and the interesting topic of spices and their properties, but the big let-down was the characters and the way they played out over the course of the novel.   Tilo, the spice mistress of the title, has been sent into a life as an old woman running an Indian grocery and spice shop, as a punishment of sorts for being willful and selfish in her previous form, and must abide by rules such as never looking at herself in a mirror, never touching another person and never leaving her store. As you might guess, over the course of the novel she breaks all of them.  She uses the powers of her wares to aid the various visitors who patronize her store; unfortunately, these people are all pretty much stock characters: the young wife who is terrorized by her husband-by-arranged-marriage, the angry Indian grandfather of an Americanized granddaughter, the boy who joins a gang to try to fit in after being teased about his turban in previous years, etc. In every case, each individual's mini-plot plays out in the manner that you would predict. No curveballs, no unexpected twists; it's like watching one of the "serious" episodes that are sometimes thrown into a sitcom series -- you know how things are going to turn out, and that it will all be safe and set right at the end.   Tilo's heart is tested by the man whom she refers to as "My American," who is of course haunted by his own tortured past. Again, this relationship could have added some real depth to the story, but it just comes off as cheesy. The author really missed an opportunity to give more life to the piece.  As for the writing style, it just feels like it's trying too hard. Description that's supposed to seem mystical and emotional feels strained and overblown.  The main redeeming quality about the book, as stated, is the information given about the properties of the different spices that Tilo uses to help her various friends along their paths.   If even one of the two flawed areas -- the characters or the style -- had been better, this book would have been much more enjoyable. As it was, it was frustrating to premeditate exactly what everyone was going to do next, and to grind your teeth at the persistently flowery language.  The premise of the book really had so much potential, but the implementation was disappointing. I wish I could have liked it more but it left me feeling flat. For a story centered around spices, it was ultimately bland 
 I give this book 2 stars for the occasional first person insights into the Doors. But there is too little of it. There is too much of the rantings of a man who is apparently trapped in the 6os, and is undergoing a personal mind battle between himself as a flower child and a business man. He often comes on as one or the other of these two conflicting images.  Often he rants about the establishment and their love of power and money, but at the same time he exudes great excitement when he describes the business and money aspect of his music career; like the big bucks he got when 'Light my Fire' hit the charts and the new car and beach house he was able to then buy. Or when he describes getting his first royalty check from Elektra and "Grinning and Dithering" while he makes his wife guess at the figure. Then she "squeals" and they hug and yell "We're rich!" A few pages later he goes on ranting about power and money hungry people.  I found too much hypocrisy in his writing like when he keeps using the phrase "I hope the lovers win the war. Don't you?" Then a few pages later he comes on as anything but a lover with his nasty second-hand gossip about Morrison allegedly telling him that he didn't like John Desmore. Uh, wouldn't a true lover and person who preaches peace and goodwill amongst each other, have kept that to himself rather than basically telling the world "Jim liked me more than John." I mean, what does that serve other than hurting another man's feelings? Nasty stuff from a self professed lover of people.  "Break On Through" is a much more supperior book on this topic. And it is a shame. Because with Manzarek's personal insight into the group, he could have provided the greatest story....But instead he chose to hog the spotlight and put too much of himself, his hypocritical pseudo hippy rantings, and his mean spirited jabs at others who were a part of this chapter in his life, into this book. I was hoping for more. Instead he delivered mostly junk 
 This DVD was a complete disappointment.  The cover says that this is "Flamboyant.  Colorful.  Sensual."  There was no plot, or story.  The whole DVD was a narrator talking about the film.  Very boring, possibly the most boring DVD ever made.  We've watched a few of Carolos Saura's flamenco videos and loved them.  Perhaps there was a film with a plot, but this DVD is just narrative.   Terrible 
 What is the purpose of this account of the life of Anthony Blunt, the great traitor?  This biography is a long emollient salve applied to Blunt's traitorous and murderous life.  Its strengths are all associated with its depiction of the milieu in which he moved so effortlessly, the upper class institutions of England which he betrayed.    The author, a product of St. Paul and Oxford, is an excellent writer and an indefatigable researcher.  Her style is mellow and balanced--her analysis subtlely and consistently biased in favour of Mr. Blunt.  The only time her mellifluous prose veers into ascerbity is when referring to Mr. Blunt's detractors, including Brown, Deacon, and the various former KGB operatives who have written memoirs.  Their opinions, Ms. Carter assures us, are unreliable, badly researched, poorly judged, and so on.  But not to worry--Ms. Carter does have the facts, and, she assures us, the proper perspective on Blunt's actions.  Despite her many portentuous references to KGB archives, most of her research is based upon secondary sources, a great deal of which is journalism, and on interviews with people to whom she gained access no doubt because of her social background and elite education.    And these sections of the book are indeed fascinating:  Ms. Carter refers authoritatively to climates of opinion in the English upper classes that allegedly prevailed during periods before she was born.  Her account sometimes reads like it was written by a contemporary of Anthony Blunt's, one with a remarkably benevolent attitude towards the traitor.  This authenticity of tone is a testament to Ms. Carter's long years of research and her supple and even-tempered prose. It is also a testament, however inadvertant, to the tolerant, clubby upper class climate which allowed a traitor like Blunt to flourish for so long.  On the surface, the purpose of this book is to present a balanced judgment on the life and deeds of Anthony Blunt.  Its rhetoric is indeed a model of moderate, even-tempered balance.  But that is not the character of the book, nor is a balanced account its true purpose.  What this book actually represents is an example of what it sets out to document--the extraordinarily forgiving attitude of the English upper classes to the Cambridge spies who betrayed their country.  It can only be hoped that its appealing surfaces will not persuade the public to accept this Blunt biography as anything other than an all-too-refined case of special pleading on behalf of a cunning, unrepentent, and all-too-refined traitor to his country 
 Please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys.  The plastic ring holding the keys can break.  We found the small broken piece in our baby's mouth!  We received this toy only three weeks ago 
 I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.   I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.    I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.       
 I got this as a christmas gift and i thought it was pretty cool until i started using it. It doesn't work at all. It looked really "modern technology" but it does't do anything but make thumping noises. Once when i tried to hear through the wall, i suddenly beeped really loud and it hurt my ears so i returned it. Please don't waste your money unless you have maybe a 5 year old that's just pretending to be a spy and not actually using the toy 
 While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine 
  Though rated highly in some quarters (especially university campuses), I think this book is terribly over-rated. Its popularity may simply spring from the fact that Kasulis is conveying what people would like to hear, rather than what Rinzai (Lin-chi) had to say for himself. Don't trust me! - get hold of a good translation of the Rinzai Roku - and judge for yourself.     I particularly distrust the way Kasulis has used Lin-chi's 'true man of no title' (wu wei chen-jen) to fit the contemporary disease of relativism - viz., that the 'true man' is 'situational.' I know this tallies with deconstructionist platitudes served up as philosophy these days, with their own way of deconstructing 'selves' - but, read Lin-chi at length, and see how much it corresponds.    Lin-chi's 'true man' (chen-jen) refers to the transcendental ground or Buddha-nature. Chen-jen' is a 'noun' - not a verb, hence Kasulis has turned Lin-chi's meaning inside out or back to front, by exploiting it in the verbal sense. Lin-chi talks about being 'free from birth and death' - and therefore, he is not encouraging anyone to identify with the fleeting phenomenal world. The 'true man' is not a monkey, jumping from one situation to another. On the contrary, Lin-chi asks us to look into the underlying nature of 'appearances' - to discover the immutable - the 'true man' who lacks nothing. This is not behavioural psychology - but Buddhism, and nothing to do with finding authentic selfhood as the anomaly of given situations. But as I say, don't trust me! Read Lin-chi, ponder his words well - and consider the outcome.  
 I have recently purchased the tape series of Love 101 much to my disappointment.  If you are looking for a little reinforcement and a different perspective on how to accomplish self-esteem, these are not the  tapes for you.  However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips  of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a  try.  I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem  directly but more to do with announcing the next "ditty" ranging  from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx.  I doubt if most of these  routines and songs have seen the light of day since the big band era. These  tapes were more of a trip down memory lane than a "boost" in  one's self-esteem 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 Stopped halfway. Just didn't work for me - seemed a bit shallow / dragging 
 I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable 
 While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same.  First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring.  The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be.   Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text.  If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used.  McCabe & Smith is about to come out with their 7th edition in since about the same time as the 1st of this one 
 This is not a how to book. This is a picture book. The author is a consumate artist, no doubt about that, but the publishers have marketed it in such a way as to suggest that you...the reader...will learn how it can be done. Not true. The author merely shows countless numbers of his own work. This leaves you to guess how it can be done. If you are a fan of the authors work then add this to your collection. If you want a book on how to render lighting effects in your own work then pass this book bye 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I'm in my 30's, light skin, everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try; didn't work for me, after using it for a while I had break outs and my skin became greasy. It's not what they say it is, I've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is Amazing Grace for your body, but the skin care products are a scam, go for Neutrogena or clinique , good luc 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 Don't bother - complete and utter rubbish. Too bad this cannot rate zero stars, it's not even worth that 
 I know the Inmon vs. Kimball thing has turned into something of a feud. Having owned the first and second edition of this particular book (the first edition is now more useful than ever hollowed out with a knife to hide jewelry) and having browsed through the third edition that a colleague purchased, I must say that the major change since the obscure first edition is that Inmon has now taken a much more defensive tone now that Kimball is out there presenting clear, concise and useful real-world concepts and implementation techniques and gathering followers. I also own Inmon's "Using the Data Warehouse", "Data Warehousing and the Zachman Framework", and "Exploration Warehousing" and the question that comes to mind most after reading through these books is why did I waste the money. The reading is difficult, not so much because the subject matter is difficult, but more because it seems to be dry theory and has little advice on how to actually design a real working data warehouse. When later, Kimball came out with his breakthrough book: "The Data Warehouse Toolkit", it all seemed conceptually so much simpler and straightforward 
 The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost" were excellent. I didn't much care for "Alien Invasion" or "Cyber Chase." I thought "The Legend of the Vampire" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost." Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. ("Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of "Zombie Island," "The Witch's Ghost," or even "Legend of the Vampire."           
 The people who are "coerced" into attending 12 step programs as referenced in this book are drunk drivers. There are no SS henchmen wandering around neighborhoods scooping innocents into AA meetings. I do not have pity for any drunk driver or their sentences. For many, many years the courts saw people with 6, 7, 8 10 DUI offenses, and what do you do? Lock someone in prison for LIFE on what, a 6th DUI?  How about the 10th?  Where in 20,000 fatal accidents alcohol played a role, does anyone really have pity for someone who must attend some AA meetings for nearly contributing to this carnage?? This number is as many Americans as are murdered by _guns_. I challenge the authors of this book to tell the millions of AA members who have found solace, then serenity then peace, after being sent to AA by the courts that it is such a sham.  I also challenge them to volunteer in a recovery home for indigent women, as I do, and meet with woman after woman who failed to continue an AA program of recovery, and where  it brought them.  And not instantly, and not because they said "oh gee I must drink because now I don't have AA".  QUITE the opposite.  They frequently do so after 2 or 3 years being away from the program, feeling so good about their success, they feel cured, they drink, they lose everything.    I'm certain not all drunk drivers belong in AA but I challenge the authors of this book to find the scientific methodology to identify the difference between those who will continue to drink and drive unabated & those whose first offense will be their last, and stake their lives on the road on such a test.  Many first-time offenders re-offend, but I've heard the story many times; when they realized they could not stop on their own after so many efforts, they knew where to go because they had once been sent there once by the courts.  This book is a great way for real alcoholics to recognize some injustice done to them (as opposed to the real risk of murder they were to the rest of _us_) and opt out.  Godspeed to such people and to the rest of us who share the roads with them 
 This book is probably not helpful to anyone seeking more than VERY basic social skills.  I did not find anything particularly informative.  The writing is long-winded, is generally an midly annoying, boring lecturing style.  At many points, it actually seemed as if the author was not a man, but rather, someone's wife carrying on about the commonplace, stale female gripes and frustrations about how filthy are their men. Where's the male backbone? Not here. The male author seemed to cowtow to the female of the house; it actually looks like he mirrored the concerns of various women consulted and then determined that essential manners require full male compliance.    Also, the title of the book seems misleading due to the very obvious matters discussed.  I thought this book would build an intermediate or advanced level of male manners, but most of the information is irrelevant or too basic to be helpful.   Sorry for the negative report; it was a let-down, but then again I only paid $5 for it. 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 Listen to all the other reviewers. It's THAT bad. I was at the airport facing a nice relaxing trip & saw the book & bought it despite the bad reviews on here, thinking: it can't be THAT horrible. It is. Oh, how beautiful is Jason. Oh, how beautiful is Halle. Oh, how dumb & boring could a story be? I only finished the book because of my long love of CC's books. I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OTHER THINGS TO DO. 
 Don't waste your time and money on this product.  I have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months, two in the last week.  All of them have had defective switches.  Amazon should not sell this product the quality of the switches is unacceptably poor. 3/13/0 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 In the beginning of this book I found it a bit disturbing; however, I pressed on and I was glad. I soon came to be highly disappointed by this book though because it seemed so cliche` in the fact that almost every drugged out junkie seems to find a god and heal themselves; then discuss it for 15 chapters. Aside from that fact, almost 3/4 of the book was about doing various drugs, I felt it was drug out too long and could have been summed up in fewer chapters. It got to be monotonous and tiresome reading about the authors junkie habits over and over again. Although the book had great potential and could have been one of the greats; I felt it became monotonous 
 As a student of history, in particular Roman history, I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book about the Emperor Hadrian. I could not possibly have been more disappointed. It is but a series of vague philosophical essays written from the perspective of a modern French woman who does not understand either men or history. The writing style is unengaging and boring, literally putting me to sleep. I am selling this book on a popular auction and will settle for whatever I can get for it. Though Hadrian was indeed one of the more interesting and competent Roman emperors, I strongly advise passing on this effort, because it fails. 
 Set in Cold Ridge, New Hampshire, Carine Winters is 33, a photographer.  Her parents died when she was three and she, her brother and sister were raised by their uncle.  Carine has known Tyler North all her life.  Ty's single mom was eccentric and not close with anyone.  After her death Ty inherited her land and trust fund.  He's an Air Force pararescuer.  When Carine unknowingly interrupts a smuggling operation, Ty helps save her.  They fell for each other and planned to marry.  A week before the wedding Ty backed out.  Meanwhile, one of the smugglers plans revenge on Carine and just about everybody she knows.  One of Ty's pararescuer pals is suspected of murder, the pal's son is threatened, the pal's wife is a crybaby breakdown-waiting-to-happen, Carine's sister's husband is a senator, Uncle Gus has a lazy dog . . . this story was a disjointed, convoluted mess.  The characters were not likeable and didn't make sense.  I didn't know it was a sequel; just picked it up and started reading.  Maybe reading the first book would have made a difference.  I read as much as I could and skimmed the rest.  
 After reading Lean Thinking, The Goal and a few other books on manufacturing, I picked up this book based on the Amazon recommendation. I am sorry to say that the book was disappointing since it spoke of concepts  that are well known. JIT, Kanban, Lean Manufacturing. Just like the  hundreds of books on these concepts, this is a mere extension of the same  concept and nothing in this book is different. I am used to reading both  management and extremely technical books, but this one just could not hold  my interest 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 This book was a gigantic disappointment.  The whole "male fairy godmother" thing just insulted my intelligence from the beginning.  What could have been an insightful book about real customer service impacts really "lost it on the dismount."  The examples of customer strategy seemed forced and stretched beyond plausibility.  The key character did not really seem to wrestle or grapple with many of the concepts.  A business fable should inspire action, and this book simply did nothing.  It wasn't a bad "read" per se.  There were some entertaining facets, but it you are really looking to wow your customers and turn your business around, this is not the book for you.  No matter how time-constrained you might be for a read on the topic, this will not be a good investment 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 This book is not useful, helpful or inspirational. I received this book as a Christmas gift and was skeptical of it, but decided to give it a chance. Instead of giving me good advice on "getting a life" it gave me literal advice, i.e. how to make your bed, how to take a shower, telling me to make a schedule, etc. I really can't figure out who would need this advice. I was hoping for information on how to feel less like a drooling idiot and feel more connected at the end of a day filled with housework, cooking, Dora the Explorer, frazzled nerves from my 2 year-old and a husband who does't appreciate how hard I work. Instead I wasted the little time I had to myself by reading this simplistic and obvious (yeah I have showering mastered by now) advice.  The authors suggest getting a journal and writing in it and they give you exercises to write about. However the authors never give you any idea about what your writings mean. I guess it's meant to be reflective for each journalist, but I'm still confused as how this is supposed to help me.   I'm pretty sure the authors were stay-at-home-moms who needed some cash so they jumped on the "let's write a book" bandwagon, unfortunately there is really no depth or substance to this book. Save your $15 and buy yourself something - you'll get more satisfaction out of it 
 First of all, I did not think this was a lousy cookbook because I disagreed with the vision of it. I think that it really was put together fast and cheap, probably to make a quick dollar.  There were many typos, wrong measurements, and some nasty tasting food.   I am no CIA chef, but I am a housewife who loves to cook.  If I have to improve on a cookbooks recipe, then it must be bad.  You are better off finding something else.  Our you can have mine for free 
 You can't write a mystery without a solution and call it "pulp" or "noir" in my book.  Those of you who are fans of King's writing will find this readable, but hardly enjoyable.  Those who are not would do well to stay away.  We're halfway through the book before we're even introduced to the "mystery", and we're finished the book before we're told that there's no solution to it.   And worst of all, none of this seems to bother the Downeast characters narrating the tale 
 When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read. If you're thinking about buying a manufactured home, do yourself a favor and buy "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" instead. You'll be glad you did before the ink on the contract dries 
 I too will never buy another one of this man's books. How a person could have looked into this dog's eyes and then kill him without expending more effort on another solution is beyond me. I am skimmed through this book at the store before I bought it. I almost couldn't drive home for the tears and the rage I felt that Katz had done this to a intelligent and sensitive creature that loved him and trusted him. Shame on him. He doesn't deserve the love of any dog and Devon deserved a better "friend. 
 After trying (and failing) to stay awake whilst reading the novel, I can recommend it as a sure-fire cure for insomnia! Aside from that the book is boring, badly written and a real disapointment 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.  Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.   Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.  But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised?? 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 I have to say I agree with some of the other reviews here, that this collection of poetry by "Rumi" is in reality modern American poetry by someone drawing only very loosely on Rumi's work. It is rather a stretch to call it a translation! If one were cynical, one might think the large number of books from this "translator" indicates merely a money-making exercise.  Much better collections/translations can be found, like Maryam Mafi's and Azima Melita Kolin's, but I would personally recommend Juliet Mabey's Rumi: A Spiritual Treasury. This is not only a gorgeous book to look at, but more importantly, both its selection and English rendition demonstrate a deftness of touch that make you think you are reading something very close to the original sentiment. A rare achievement 
 Steven Johnson claims that TV is making us smarter.  (Explicitly in his New York Times article and implicitly in his book.)  In support of this bold claim, he offers absolutely no scientific evidence. Yet his book is so skillfully written that he has managed to convince a huge number of people that he is correct. (It helps that so many people want to be convinced.)  How does he accomplish this sleight-of-hand?  In his book, he references a number of studies showing that video games improve various types of thought processes. The number he cites for TV. Zero.   On the other hand there are numerous studies showing that kids who watch excessive TV (over 1 to 2 hours per day), tend to do worse in school, don't concentrate as well, have problems with language and reading, etc...  By describing in loving detail the complexities of both video  games and various TV shows, and then referencing these scientific studies (for video games) he gives the impression that both have a similar effect on the brain. This couldn't be further from the truth. Playing Video games involve effort and concentration, while watching TV actually slows down the viewers' brain waves, hence the zombie look.  For more on TV's effects on the mind, see the Scientific American cover story (Feb 2002) "Television Addiction Is No Mere Metaphor".  The arguments he uses to support his contention are that TV is becoming more and more complex and the Flynn Effect. The Flynn Effect is the fact that IQ's in the U.S. and other countries have been rising about 3 points per decade. What Mr. Johnson fails to mention is that this effect in the U.S. started in 1918. TV wasn't even invented until the 1940s, and didn't become commonplace until the 1950s. Mr. Johnson also fails to mention the fact that SAT scores have fallen substantially over the past 40 years.  Even if TV shows are getting more complex (which is entirely plausible considering the amount of time and money invested in TV) there still is no evidence that that translates into smarter viewers.  On the subject of violent TV causing increased aggression, Mr. Johnson is completely dismissive. He argues that because violent crime has gone down over the last 10 years, that that proves there is no real connection. Never mind that the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the *entire* world. Also never mind the over 1000 scientific studies done over the past 30 years showing a link between violent TV and aggression (for both children and adults).  The editorial review describes him as a science writer, but for my money, PR hack would be much more accurate.  
 ..I recently purchased the first "House" movie, i remember watching it as a kid, it was apparently alot scarier during my adolesence, anyways the second one came with it for free, and i must say it was garbage, i did not have the patience to sit thru this crap, i now use this dvd disc as a cup coaster.Peace 
 This book encouraged me to read it with the mystery that lingered within.  However, when I read it, I was very disappointed.  The ending was predictable and a very boring way to end the novel.  I found the book dealt with unnecessary exploiations of children's sexuality and wasn't impressed at all.  In fact I found it very disturbing.  The novel was too dramatic and over the top.  The one good thing about the novel is that it ended 
  I would have to say reading this ridiculous book made me more angry and irrated then in recent memory.  McDowell's concept of "new tolerance" is a joke.  If tolerance has gone under some sort of transformation as he contends than I strongly believe it is definately for the better.  McDowell attempts to convince that reader the tolerance of differance is the same as tolerance of evil.     For example lets take the situation at the beginning of the book: The relationship between the mother Monica and the daughter Sharry.  Now conflict arose between the tow of them because Sherry wanted her boyfriend to stay in her room while they were over.  Monica found this upsetting because she's a Christian.  So, Sherry agreed that they would not sleep together while residing at her parents place.  This did not satisfy the mother because she was now aware that the daughter and her boyfriend were having sex.  The daughter did not insist that they be allowed to sleep together while staying at her parents place.  She did not call her mother's beliefs archaic, or even criticese them at all.  What she did do is inform the mother that she respected her views on not having sex befor marriage and therefore will not sleep with her boyfriend while they stay there but at the same she does not share those views and therefore will not stop sleeping with the boyfriend.  Mcdowell  does not agree with the manner in which the daughter handled the situation and utilizes this example explain his warped problem with tolerance, or "new tolerance" as he likes to call it.  A reasonable individual would see that the daughter could not have handled the situation any better.  Like or not just because  Sherry is Monica's child she is still an individual and an adult with the ability and the right to make her own decisions on matters such as that.  Last time I checked this is still a free society.   The incident involving Beverly Schnell; the woman who placed aad in the newspaper for "a mature Christian handyman."  The government found that this ad was discriminatory.  If you think about it carefully you will derive at the realization that it was discrimination.  Schnell did not place this ad on a church bulleton booard or a church newsletter.  She placed it in a newspaper.  Newspapers are meant for the general public.  She has  no right to determine the religion of a potential tenant. it is the same as if she specified a desired race.  For example if the the ad read; "a mature White handyman."  Mcdowell tries to to twist this situation into some sort of example of hypocrisy and intolerance towards Christians. 
 This system is very expensive, but Bose didn't even bother to put an optical input so that you can get the optimal sound from your dvd player.  I strongly think that Bose likes to rip off consumers.  I say so because if they had placed an optical input, then there would be very little difference between this system, and their 3-2-1 system. A system that Bose retails for twice as much money  
 This book has failed to tell the truth on all aspects.  I challenge Eric Shawn to a debate about the so-called Oil for Food "scandal", and everything UN.  Why does he need to repeat the Fox News talking points rather than do real research.  I wasted my money on this book, and would like a refund 
 This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.  However, I am going to return these cassette tapes because the 4th and last tape broke.  I will ask for a replacement though and not a refund 
 This is sad for me because I love her other work. And even though that last couple of books aren't as funny as they were in the beginning, they still have a plot and they make sense. I feel cheated by this series and won't be reading anymore of it.  I called my friends and told them not to read this. The plot is just too stupid, who is going to cut up a couple of NASCAR's and steal a hauler and seriously what guy doesn't have tools in the trunk of his car, even if they are just for show? Then you have a dead guy in plastic wrap and you argue about what god would want you to do with him?  The Cigar/Fruit stand ladies, are not only annoying, all the "secret" staying over is just ridiculous. The autographing was kind of funny in the 1st book but in this one it was over used and stupid. If you're hiding, you hide. In the opening of the book Barney said no body cheats her, and in the end she's sleeping with Sam who did exactly that.   I am tired of media that has women taking back cheaters or worse yet begging for a second chance. Stupid funny isn't for me and a bag of dog poop? Not funny. This book treats us like we are too stupid to care there is nothing but a bunch of slapstick going on, I might as well have watched a 3 stooges episode it would have been more fun.   There were a few times I laughed, the NASCAR stuff was interesting but the rest of it had me calling my mom mid book and asking her to shoot me.  
 I thought the book was very well written, but that the Morman angle was over the top. There are stereotypes about Mormans that are not true, we GET IT. I skipped over pages of "discussions" on the Morman faith.  If it was not for that theme, I would have reccommended this book to my friends 
 This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.  Though here in America we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity, yet, to Europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation I ask, where are your child protection agents, your social workers, your law-enforcement agents, your religious leaders and, for crying out loud, the parents?  I admire Europe's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity, whether on the screen or on their beaches, but when you view this film, you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in America against sexual exploitation.  I cannot think of a more vicious, sinister crime.  I believe the body has a soul, only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body, let alone a normal, healthy childhood.  My poor heart just cries out to them.  I practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question. I was going to rent "Angels, But Not Angels," but this film, and "Mandragora", were enough for me 
 This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author 
 The whole idea is great, but very thin plastic and cheap. It stated for cats up to 10lbs and my cat is 9lbs and the first time she used it, it collapsed. If it was made with some type of stronger material, I think it would of worked fine 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 The sample segments on the website are misleading.  Virtually every cut on the CD is very dissonant... not what I would have expected from the website sampler 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 This should be called the "John Ford tiny collection", as most of his major films are not included. Even "John Ford the early years" would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of Ford's work.  Shame on Amazon for their collaboration in this matter, and for advertising the John Wayne/John Ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other. 
 we had this camera for about a year until on Thanksgiving Day while out of town it broke.  The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  I am looking into now buying the Canon powershot 6. 
 I gave this book a low rating, not because it's "offensive," but because it's blah humor.   I am a huge fan of offensive parodies (ex - South Park and Family Guy), but I found this book disappointingly boring. The jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated Pollock jokes, but most folks would find it to be a major yawn-fest...or just annoying. If I get a funny book, I want to laugh through most of it--not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages (too much work).   Anyhue, if you want to laugh at pregnancy, better books are "Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads," "My Boys Can Swim" (for the gents) and "Pregnancy Sucks" (for the ladies). They are waaaay more funny AND somewhat educational too (whoa! what a concept).  
 I was given one of these as a gift. I replaced it in my Dolby Digital DVD to Amp signal path. It sounds no better than the cheapo Wal-Mart video coax cable I had been using for a couple of years. Then I thought, isn't that the whole reason to go digital in the first place? 1's and 0's don't know the difference between Oxygen-free copper and regular wire! Save your money 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 I  did not completely read the book because I became so exasperated with the book and the author that I quit. The author's continuous praise for a certain software product and his severe criticism of other software used by the author makes one wonder about the relationship between the author and the commercial owner of the praised software. The author even alluded to the non-praised software as possibly being available in a pirated edition. Conversely, the author cautions the reader about copyright law when discussing the praised software. The author is very enamored with himself, and it detracts from the book. The book is unnecessarily verbose and poorly edited.  I was very disappointed, as I was looking for a *how-to-do-it book,* and this book is not suitable for that purpose. Of more concern is the cost of the book's recommended products, which are necessary in order to follow the author. The software products used by the author are commercial and range in cost from less than $100 to a lot more than $100. The reader will spend several hundred dollars on commercial software and other products (Microsoft DDK) if the reader gets the items discussed and recommended by the author. I don't dispute the quality of the products, just the cost of them in addition to the price of the book. There are some errors. For example, the author says Microsoft DDK is free, and yet it has cost about $100 for several years. It would be very expensive to buy the author's suggested products in order to follow the author while reading the book. A CD with source code is included, but without the software its value is diminished. I am sure others will have better experiences, but I cannot recommend the book. 
 The author makes the hypothesis that Edicaran fauna are distinct from other multicellular animals and that they underwent a different type of embryological development.  The book presents no real scientific test of  these ideas.  Instead appeals to over extended analogies and conjecture 
 A novel like this needs a light touch.  Instead, Brown gives us a fantasy sex scene after which the lovers lie in each other's arms discussing Reagan-Bush AIDS policy & the evolutionary purpose of gay people 
 I learned a great deal from Edward Smith's other book, The Vegetable Gardener's Bible, and I use it as a reference on germination and growing soil temperatures.  So I did not hesitate to order his Incredible Vegetables from Self-Watering Containers when I decided to buy some books on container gardening.  I ordered this book and McGee and Stuckey's Bountiful Container. Bountiful Container is comprehensive, thoughtful and very helpful.  However, this book reads like an ad for self-watering containers, which were apparently provided free to the author with the hope that he might endorse them.  Unlike the author's first book, this lavishly illustrated book is short on information, more suitable for a coffee table than a container gardener. If there were a money-back guarantee, I would request it 
 This machine does not work.  I will be returning it to find a better "first" machine for my daughter.  The stitiches do not hold, every instruction was followed to the letter.  It is not worth even 4 cents, much less 14 dollars.  I would have paid more for something that acutally works.  I'll keep lookin 
 I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course.  At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal  usefulness.  When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was  introduced.  If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who  recommend other sources 
 Considering that in its heyday, people danced to the Motown Sound, I expected a project titled "Motown Remixed" to be comprised of slamming dance mixes featuring the classic vocals of Motown's greatest.  Instead, we got this.  I didn't enjoy this set at all, except for the fact that arrangements are so stripped down that the backing vocals are highlighted (most notably Stevie Wonder's "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" with Wonderlove's vocals prominent, when used.  The other case of highlighted backing vocals would be the inclusion of what I consider the Supremes' worst single ever, "My World Is Empty Without You."  I also think it's the worst remix in a collection of bad remixes - and yet, it's most innovative, turning the uptempo original into a banal ballad).  This is a must-have set only for collectors of anything released on the Motown label.  A worthwhile set for those into cooler, jazzier, experimental stuff (or marijuana smokers).  For the Motown Sound enthusiasts, pass on this one 
 OK, so most of the reviews I read for this film said how great it was, well I for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing Angelina's breasts.  The acting was poor, the script was stupid, and the sets were lame.  I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (ie Killer Kondom) but this one took the cake.. I would watch tromavision flicks over this one ANY day.  save your money. If you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week ; 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 Thought this was the last book and I bought it, terribly excited and surprised at the lack of hype. It's actually just a diary, so if you have a child interested in the series, it's definitely something they'd enjoy. Otherwise...meh (shrugs shoulders) 
 I was very interested in reading this book due to it's title, but as the saying goes, "never judge a book by it's "title"".  I found the author to be arrogant, bregadocious and totally prejudiced against anything not of the "democratic" persuasion.  In addition I dont think he stayed on the subject matter, but rather used this book to expound his biased views 
 In fact not good at all..  I really don't like Good Charlotte.. And I don't own this CD, my brother does.  Almost all the songs are about the singer feeling sorry for himself, whining about how miserable he is. And the lyrics are very, very simple.  "Hold on" is supposed to be a song against suicide, but I find it totally unbelievable, when theres a song on the CD Called "the day that I die", where he sings that the happiest of his life is the that he dies. And I think he mentions death in some other songs too. So maybe he is not that miserable, or "hold on" is just an attempt to gain more popularity and being heroic. It really makes no sense.  I'm giving this CD 1 star because I really think it's bad. Not because I think "real punk" and "classic rock" is the only good music, and you should buy that instead (that's just stupid). There are lot's of great alternatives to this cd. But there are also a lot of bands in this genre, that are almost as bad as Good Charlotte.  Comparing this to Blink 182 is insane. Blink 182 makes great melodies and clever lyrics 
 I seriously hate this model!  it was soooooooooo hard to remove the pieces that i had to do it with my teeth! GOd i hate this!  Its realistic but hard to work with 
 1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  o The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  o One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  o The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:   81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,   90% are gone in 3 months, and   95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.    First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.   Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?   The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.   And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.   
 i love this movie ,so it pains me to give it two stars but really other than the gore and bad acting,this is one of the worst!!! only for gore fans(like me),other wise stay away!! 
 I have an XM-ready Onkyo SR-603X, and bought a Connect and Play, since I love XM so much in my car.  Setup was easy, I got a signal quickly, but the sound quality is poor.  When I listen to DVDs, CDs, my iPod, even FM radio on my Onkyo, they all sound great.  XM, however is a big disappointment in sound quality, even though my signal strength is over 80% (70% is recommended).  It sounds nowhere near as "full" or detailed as I was expecting.  Listen before you buy and be careful 
 ...because I do not think that is going to happen.  I have only NOT finished one other book in my life, but I really did not see any point in spending more time reading past the 3/4 mark of this guide.  I did try!    In all fairness to the author, I do not know what I really expected from this book.  I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try, though I am usually not one to seek instruction on undertakings as individually-tailored as travel.  I like the idea of "threading," but the idea hardly seems novel; one only has to travel once to understand that the journey is measured as much by the travel between destinations as in the places themselves.  Aside from this common ground, I find little of the author's advice useful.  If you are really going to be doing the kind of cultural trekking that the author describes, you would probably be best to think through your own plan instead and "situationalize" what could happen on your particular route and your plans.    This book may be good for someone who calls a one-week stay in a Las Vegas hotel a vacation.  Besides that, I see little difference between the wisened "threader" and the jet-bound traveller who only hits major cities in his/her travels - both are engaged in an experience of going and doing, in their own ways, and not so much about being in a place.  
 Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck! If you only take the first letter of each word, you get a swear word! What a laugh-riot!  Seriously. Get over yourself. It's terrible, it isn't funny, and it's the same, godd*mn thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again!! SHUT UP!! The only different part of the song (that's different from their other songs) is when...um...I'm drawing a blank here...well, the video has Bam in it!...But he's a sellout...dang 
 I agree with all the one star reviews that this book lacks everything. I've read quite a few E. Leonard books and enjoyed most of them. This was his worst so far 
 This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline.  At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.  This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.  By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.  Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.  To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.  In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony. 
 Most of the criticism of this book seems to come from those who disagree with its argument, or those who didn't like the idea of reading a polemic.   Actually, I was at the outset sympathetic to the argument and enjoy a good rant; however I couldn't bear this book: the writing is appalling.  It is abolutely stuffed full of "knowing" references and  pop-culture slang.  Sometimes this creates the impression of trying to hide a weak argument in clever language.  Other times it's just plain irritating.    Let me give you an example, based on opening the book on a random page.  Here we go, pages 44-45:  - "I would affirm that yes indeedybob there are values the market can't compute or dictate..."  - "That crew [Marx and "his pal" Engels] was far better at how capitalism works than at coming up with policy-wonk recommendations."  - "Humanities geeks are more likely to be squishy-liberals and snail-darters."  - "Technolibertarians wouldn't really know how to grok a less quantitative/algorithmic weltanschauung.  It's C.P.Snow's two cultures antipathy taking a form he hadn't quite imagined."  Anyway, after gritting my teeth through a hundred pages of this I gave up.  The writing was just getting in the way of the argument.  Maybe the person I should be blaming is her editor.  Oh, and her sub-editor too: it's full of typos.  I know that's a pedantic thing to say, but how often do you read a good book with terrible spelling 
 Yes this is one of the best, if not THE best, of Felas recordings.  Why then have I only given it one star?  For the simple reason that this Terrascape CD is, unless they have corrected their blunder, an absolute travesty.  Why?  Because, at least on my copy, purchased some 6 years ago, every single sax solo has been virtually eliminated from the mix.  You can still here it way off in the distance but this, and I have the original vinyl to compare with, is NOT the original mix.  I have played this CD on many different systems and the fault is definitely there.  Be very careful before you buy this CD 
 This isn't a very good book. It might be good if you're in love with history and you like reading 'Harriet freed slaves. She took them to Canada.' over and over again. Someone would read this and think Harriet Tubman was boring. If this is Harriet Tubman's life, then my life is cool. In other words,beware. This book is only for school reports. I wouldn't say this is a good book by any means. It's like being in slavery when you're reading this. I'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Arthur Seldon uses Abraham Lincoln as an example of a leader who believed in limited government, "of the people, by the people, and for the people".  In actuality, Lincoln lead a failed government attempt at state railroad building when he was in the Illinois legislature.  He instituted the first conscription in the United States, and the first income tax.  He lead the charge of an unconstitutional export tax on Southern cotton and then an actual blockade.  He intimidated the Supreme Court and executed Union soldiers for sleeping on duty.  Seldon should do a bit of reading about Lincoln before he uses him as an icon for small government.  I, personally, was so turned off by the introduction that I couldn't bring myself to read the book 
 I have never heard such a boring,monotone style. This music is absolutely depressing.Music is supposed to make you feel good, not down. This is "art" music, not real music. This could be one of the worst  choices I have made in contempopary music. 
 ...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange.  I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky.  This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency.  The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one.  Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil.  I would not have purchased it if I had known this 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . . 
 I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.    I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos.  I'll review the Cannon  once I've had it for a few months 
 Expected more from this movie - although DeNiro was good as usual 
 I purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem. Big mistake! It simply will not stay put no matter what chair I tried it with. The arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much, it has you bending over backwards. I believe it actually made my back ache more. 
 I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them.  This isn't one of those cases.  I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced.  I bought this book with lots of anticipation.  I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents.  After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book.  Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts.  I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation.  Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR.  Those would be "The Jesus I Never Knew" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and "Disappointment with God" (Which also was spectacular).  If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's.  As for "Reaching the Invisible God," I wouldn't buy it 
 I was quite disappointed to find this "book"--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called "entertaining" and "enlightening" you could try "From Lowbrow to Nobrow" (2006).     
   Ok, so I bought this book a few years ago, mainly to educate myself.  I enjoyed and used the book for quite a while...... until I tried the Atkins approach.  I agree with the addition of hydroxycitric acid if you're going to follow Dr. Cherewatenko's diet.  I don't agree with low fat because fat is ESSENTIAL for keeping our GOOD cholesterol up, which is what cleans your veins of blood clots, except the ones caused from too much Calcium (Vitamin K cleans that -- also, Vitamin K absorbs about 55% more Calcium and Magnesium -- Proven in a test of 70,000 women, in which 33% of those WITHOUT Vitamin K suffered from Hip Fractures -- 33%!!!)   On the author's diet my Glucose levels were between 99 and 135mg/dl after 2 - 3 hours of eating a meal.  Always inconsistent.  After a few months I began taking 500 - 1000mg of Cinnamon to drop the level when needed (Works VERY well). ==== NOW, when I eat protein, fat, veggies and cheese without any carbs, my Glucose levels stay steady at 85mg/dl...... until my next meal.  No snacking needed.  But if I feel like a snack I nibble on pepperoni or I just cook up a couple of eggs, adding cheese, Whole Milk and lots of REAL butter.  My Glucose level never rises above 85mg/dl except when I first wake up because the liver produces Glucose when you are asleep.  My Glucose level also NEVER drops below 80mg/dl ...... unless I'd let myself go hungry.  My over-all cholesterol is now perfect and my doctor is completely baffled.    P.S.  58% of protein can be converted into Glucose as the body needs it.....all without creating extra insulin (so much insulin causes blood clots -- it is VERY VERY sticky).  Good Luck finding what works for you!!!!! 
 I had read elsewhere that the only thing to recommend this book was the fact that it was light. I have to agree. I would have been upset carrying any more weight especially as the info was often wrong. If one is able to read any other language there are much better books in almost every other language.I would suggest that the hiking section on Spain in the "Lonely Planet" is all one actually needs. As an aside, the comments on the local birds would not pass any children's needs. Example- they comment that we are now obviously nearing the coast as we now start seeing seagulls.The graphs for distance and elevation are not nearly as accurate or as detailed as those available for free at many of the hostels. The info is often so poor that I have serious doubt that the authors walked yhe Camino before writing the book. they definately did not spend many nights staying in any of the refugios 
 After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to buy this video. I  owe many, many workout videos and this is the most boring by far. I have never been able to complete it. Very dissapointing! 
 this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money.  after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had.  all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament.  the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative.  but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true 
 I just graduated with a major in PR. This books lists 88 jobs in advertsing and PR. However, it is out of date. In the PR industry there are: bloggers, web site developers and other internet position. This books lists NONE of them. In advertising, some positions (like print traffic manager) are almost non-existant. This book needs to REMOVE old 1990's job titles and ADD the jobs that firms are hiring for in the 2000's. This review is for the 2006 version of the book (4th ed). I think the author has gotten lazy and needs to do a complete overhall. This book may be of use if you are looking for a job in PRINT advertising, but most advertising agencies seem to want a person with good design skills and not just newspaper print. This book NEVER lists web skills or HTML that many employers seek today. Sad 
 This tape really doesn't show you how to do all of the cuts listed.  In fact, you don't ever see a complete groom from start to finish and all of the dogs are show dogs who stand perfectly still without the use of a grooming tether.  The tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools; she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on.  I was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a "show" with occasional comments tossed out.  The groomer almost seemed bored with her job!  I purchased it so that our novice volunteers could learn about grooming but I don't see how it will help educate them.  We'll probably never use it 
 Now that the author has a little fame, he has re-released this dog of a book.  It is very disjointed and one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read 
 The sheet looks terible after washing the first time.  It is not deserved even $20.  I don't recommend to buy. 
 When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc 
 PLEASE,help me, I dont know why I didn't receive my product. 
 To start with, I have seen pretty much all of the Wolf's Rain anime, (I may have missed a few episodes) and it wasen't all that great, anyway (THE ENDING, for great's sake!). The only thing outstanding in the anime was the music, logically nonexistent in the manga. Still, I bought the manga in hopes that it would differ from the anime in some respect, perhaps end better? Although the end is yet to come, I already dislike the manga mostly for the artwork, more precisely the wolves, whose legs resemble those of a girrafe's! And Kiba is supposed to be fluffy, but his fur looks much too stringy in the manga. Also, instead of selectively leaving out a few parts, they seem to have selectively chose a few parts to actually draw! It seems almost like a summary, they have so few scenes. What really ticks me is that my favorite part of the ENTIRE series, (which I didn't even like) the scene where Quent shoots UNDER Blue, smacking the crap out of Kiba, is left out. The entire charm of showing how in tune Blue and Quent are is left out. I just can't wait to see the second book, which I bet won't even show an ending. So much for this series- the only thing worth money are the two CD's.   P.S.- one last thing that just struck me as odd and out of place, the text on the front of the book, "Wolf's Rain" is.... Pink. Not just a little. Bright..... PINK. Almost ANY other color would do for this depressing anime. Oh, and another thing, something GOOD- the bonus thing at the end of the book- I liked that. Very Nice 
 poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do 
 The obvious attitude of the producers of this mess was clearly one of superiority.  I mean, "After all, we're shooting in IMAX 3D instead of the nefarious over/under format!"  Well, whoopdeedoo!  I'll take THE BUBBLE, METALSTORM, or AMITYVILLE 3D any day over this.  There is some nice computer graphics work here, but there's really no story to speak of.  And their so-called "history of 3D presentation" is superficial at best.  While surely impressive in Imax, ENCOUNTER looks stupid on your TV screen 'cause everything is covered in a long shot or a medium long shot.  Yes, that may work on the giant behemoth Imax screen, but reduce it in size to your TV (even my big 36-inch JVC) and it's pretty unimpressive.  Not only that, but if you're watching it in alternating-field 3D with liquid crystal glasses, then you're watching it in half the normal resolution you normally see on your NTSC screen -- so there's next to NO picture detail.  If you want a good 3D DVD movie, search the web for one of the alternating field DVD's of something like IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, HOUSE OF WAX, or DIAL M FOR MURDER (sadly only available in 3D via pirated editions because the US distributors don't care enough to bother -- so were only left with legit DVD's of crap like ENCOUNTERS and amatuer videos of murderous clowns on the rampage).  I would have given this two stars because it features (very briefly) Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson -- BUT THEY COVERED HER ONLY IN LONG SHOT TOO!  They were REALLY stooopid, so they get one star.  Boo 
 THIS IS A WASTE. UNLESS U R CRAZY OVER TOONS THEN I DEFINETLEY DONT RECOMMEND IT. IT WILL TAKE U FOREVER TO GET OUT YOUR GOOD TOONS OUT LIKE BLUE EYES AND WHEN YOU DO GET IT OUT U WILL WASTE YOUR LIFEPOINTS. AND AS FOR RELINQUSHED WELL THAT CARD IS OK. BUT FOR ALL THOSE BEGINNER DUELISTS DON'T GET IT CUZ IT TAKES A WHILE TO KNOW HOW THOSE CARDS WORK!!!!! CBFP OUT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I wanted a CD of Little Baggariddim and the person I ordered from sent me this.  Well, at least I got some of the songs from LB.  This is just ok - not bad, not good. If you want a CD of reggaelike grooves and rapping/toasting then this should work for ya.  The best cuts are the ones from Little Baggariddim. 
 Far too biased with an agenda. Forrest who was praised by  both Gen Ssherman and Lee for his military prowess is dismmised as a country rube that got lucky in Battle. Shermans own report to Grant exonerates Forrest in Fort Pillow..Tthe entire tone of the work is so redolent with contempt for Forrest and the Confederacy it might have been written by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Ward goes on about Confederate prisons wiht no mention of the savaery of Union prisons where the union did have food and medicine and simply refused to provide it. 
 I loved the Happy Hooker by Deb Stoller and so was excited when I heard about this book.  I was looking for a nice collection of various patterns.  What a disappointment.  The book was cheaply done with only a middle section of glossies of some rather ugly patterns.  There were a couple of nice things, but nothing like Deb Stoller's much nicer book.  I had heard there were to be 40 projects, but it seems like a lot less.  I didn't like the models of the projects either, for they seemed to be striving toward sexy and Now.  But most looked like hookers.  Even the wonderful Pea Coat was not shown to advantage.  Very unhappy with this poorly done book 
 First of all, isn't there something to be said for aesthetics when it comes to covers?  Well, then, the cover definitely has to be altered.  Maybe they could put a picture of a house plant on there or something to represent this guy's personality.  Secondly, the book tries to take itself way too seriously.  and C. Polite? Timid? Is this guy supposed to be funny. I thought  he was a serious art critic, then I start in and he's talking all this politix crapola.  Is this guy a comedian or not?  I thought he had a show on amazon. I once saw him do stand-up comedy and he was funny.  He talked about funny things.  But here, this ain't no pulitzer writing 'dat for for sure. Maybe he try again, but I afraid his publisher no like any more and he have to self-publish, mebbee.  I'd rather read Dr. Seuss -- this fox ain't got no sox and his ham and egss is done greened on him 
 After reading intenty through out this entire book, I found it offered nothing in the way of concrete practical help.  It covers a broad area with very little depth.  Much in the form of why this problem occurs, but very little on the how to put an end to it, other than costly treatment methods.  This book is catered more to the extreme addict, who would be better off by getting that expensive treatment rather than reading this book, which would only tell that person to get it anyway.  For the average man who wasn't severly abused or emotionally damaged, but does have a problem with fractional sexaul addiction (80% of men out there), i,e: porn,extra marital affairs, this is not the book for you.  It is built on man made psycology rather than sound biblical prinicipals despite the sparse sprinlking of verses throughout 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 I've always been a casual fan of the Talking Heads. I liked their music, but only had a few of their CD's, so I decided to treat myself to this set which I thought would be comprehensive. Well, upon receiving this mess of a "box  set" I was so taken aback that it took me a while to get to the music.  The "box" is actually a rectangular book with fairly bizarre and unappealing art. (Nudes that represent... what?) The book itself, because of its shape, does not lend itself to easy reading, and while the contents are of a decent quality, some artist appreciations by the likes of Rick Moody and commentary by the band members,some intersting curios, like notes and original lyric sheets, and a discography, trying to read this while hoping the binding holds up while the pages flop all over the place is quite a feat.  The music itself is a decent overview of the band's work. The three CD's have a nice cross section of the band's work, but for the cost and the annoying packaging, I would have been much better off with SAND IN THE VASELINE 
 I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie "Making Love" 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
 "A Music Fan" says he only knew one of these songs?!! What cave has he been living in?? His gross lack of music knowlege is scary! You can do better than this compilation - Too few songs and chosen rather arbitrarily. The songs are classics though. Still can't believe previous reviewer didn't know "Sounds of Silence", "Pretty Woman", etc. --- How sad 
 I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount. I hesitate to order this item again 
 The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why 
 I'm giving two stars solely for the great cinematography. Otherwise, this is waste of over two hours. It's the simple story of an on-again-off-again romance between two college boys, one of whom is unwilling to commit. It's devoid of dialogue for the most part and it goes absolutely nowhere. Scene after scene of...well...nothing. The plot, such as it is, flashes back and forth to no real effect. It seems too much an attempt to be artsy and falls flat there as well. Thankfully, there was enough good camera work, lighting, etc. to keep me interested, but only visually. Two+ hours was just too much, though. 
 I suppose I was looking for a "how to deal with it" from an someone educated in the field.  This was more like a "here's what happened in this school" book.  I was left saying to myself, "That's what happened in that school then.  What about what is happening in schools in other regions of the country (which makes a huge difference), and how does a parent successfully respond to the changes and conflicts that my kid is going through?"  Some of the story lines were interesting, but did not help me at all.  I regret buying the book 
 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS, I HAVE SPENT WELL OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND WITH YOUR COMPANY IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS BOOK AND I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER IMMEDIATELY.  TRULY YOURS,  BRIAN D. WHIT 
 I don't get the positive reviews.  This author rehashes information that is in all of your basic finance books.  This would make a good magazine article, but it's a waste of 400 pages.  I'll save you $20 and give you the entire book here: 1. Mututal funds are usually ran in the interest of the company, not yours. 2. It's really hard to beat the market. 3. All of the fees and soft-dollaring reduce your investment returns greatly.  But you probably already knew this 
 Although the book's jacket cites a lot of flattering comments like "fascinating" and "to our pleasure, amusement ..." - unfortunately this is simply not true. The book is - for the average reader - overly scientific, dry and boring 
 I am happy that the book has finally arrived after almost three months of its order in mid-December 2006. Otherwise no lament 
 While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 
 Toland interviewed me along with others, for this book. I was there from Aug to Dec. 1950. His accounts of battles is at times pretty accurate, but I think he wandered off in some of his political punditry. I don't believe Mr. Toland did his best work here. Fehrenbach's This Kind of War, is far superior, both in style and content. I never heard anything but sarcasm from the grunt level when Higgins was mentioned. Some of her interviews with the troops were ludicrous. Toland spends more time and effort on her than it's worth 
 This is an amazing story about a man named Dick Proenneke who retired and decided to leave the civilized world and live in the harshes climate of the Alaskan Twin Lakes area.  I have read the book and the DVD shows you movies that Dick took himself.  Very motivational film. It is fascinating to read and watch the adventures of this man's life story and wonder if you could do the same.  Highly recommend this DVD as a companion to the book.  He sure knew how to survive in the cold.  The man built a log cabin in about two weeks, it would probably take me two weeks to cut down one tree !  got to see this DVD.   
 This book seems to be cobbled together from Teitelbaum and various Web sites. It's broad and superficial. Major issues, such as the treatment of hormonal imbalances, are glossed over with a couple of sentences. Worst of all, she describes the relationship between depression and CFIDS and FMS as a "chicken-egg" thing--everyone who gets these was already depressed. There's no evidence whatsoever for this assertion, and saying it in a book damages advocacy and holds us back much in the same way as the dreaded moniker CFS. 
 I found this book to be disgusting. She must hate Sicilians to write such trash about them. The woman has no writing skills 
 As a Western seeker interested in Eastern philosophy, I found the idea behind the book very attractive, but the book itself is shallow, pointless pap.  You can learn a lot more for free just by surfing the Web 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 Being that I am new to motion this book was not an easy read.  It actually does not give the novice a leg to stand on nor does it provide the detailed information needed to create the projects that you want.  What it does do, however, is provide additional knowlege almost a part 3 of a 5 part series to motion.  If you are new to motion I would suggest you look elsewhere for your instruction but if you are already familiar with motion and its intricacies then by all means put your money down.  Even if I were well schooled in motion this still would not grace my shelves.  The direction and applications that I have in mind for motion just does not correlate with the provided instruction 
 Director:  Harold Becker Cast:  Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Miko Hughes, Chi McBride, Kim Dickens, Robert Stanton, Bodhi Elfman, Carrie Preston, Lindsey Ginter, Peter Stormare, Kevin Conway, John Carroll Lynch. Running Time: 108 minutes Rated R for violence and language.  "Mercury Rising" begins as an innovative, interesting look at govermental intelligence and the difficulties of autism, but unfortunately becomes a psuedo-"Die Hard" meets "Enemy of the State" and flops under a deflted script, mediocre acting, and lifeless direction.  FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) is washed out after confronting his superiors after an undercover job goes bad, while Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes) is an autistic child who loves puzzles. When he cracks a code that the Government put into a magazine to test it's strength he becomes a target and his parents are murdered by someone from the NSA. Jeffries is assigned to the case when the boy goes missing and easily finds him; however, Jeffries soon realizes that this is not a simple case and that both he and the boy are in great danger as NSA Colonel Kudrow (Alec Bladwin) tries to protect his code.  Despite having a career boost in the mid-1990's with the solid "12 Monkeys" in which he showed a nice range of depth, Bruce Willis proves that he an still do pretty lame and mindless films by signing on to do this. Willis looks like he is on autopilot - and Willis on autopilot is not a good thing. He mumbles his way through it and doesn't really convince aside from when being an action hero. Hughes is really good if a little annoying, but his abilities as a young actor are obviously evident in his efforts.  Baldwin's performance is reminiscent of his role in "Glengary Glen Ross" here, talking with authority and down to his staff, but he is nowhere near as good.  Ginter is menacing but not given enough time, Dickens is simply thrown into the film without thought and Peter Stormare makes a fleeting appearance.  In fairness it isn't that the film is really bad, it's more that it is condescending to it's audience. The actual plot is interesting; "Enemy of The State" was good using the same sort of `all powerful Government conspiracy'; however, this film feels so lazy in every approach that it spoils a potentially good foundation by not playing to its strengths and thus exposing its weaknesses.    
 I was with HP for 15-20 years, needed MFP read all reviews here and decided that MFC-8860DN will be a good choice (other option was HP 3055).  It has everything I need - copier, network print, scan, fax.  Easy setup (I am in IT for 25+ years).  Everything was almost perfect.  The only complaint you need to keep in mind - IT EATS 1100 WATTS when starts printing - light could flash. It was OK, until I reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3".  No problem - need to clean everything (per my experience and confirmed on Brother's web site).  Cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page.   Called Support 2 times.  After few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace DRUM.  Hey - its only 1500 pages, nowhere close to promised 25000!  After I mentioned it, they offered me 75% discount on it.  What's about warranty?  Sorry.  I spoke to supervisor, he explained that Support in Philippines can't do it, the only option - to call USA office. I replaced DRUM.  Now counter shows around 2000 pages and I have same problem again. Hey, I heard this before - never say never.  Still as of today: I would NEVER, NEVER buy Brother printer/MFC again!!! 
 See Jason Murphy's November 11 below for guidance ( not spiritual, but very worthwhile ). Mr. Murphy's opinion is right on with this reader's.     
 And also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a TV circa 1963.  Pulled in weak signals from about 3 stations 18 miles from NYC broadcast towers. 
 If you have even spent a little time in your life reading newspapers, magazines, the net, etc you will have seen 99% of these trivia lists and items.  Save your money so you can buy a better quality toilet paper 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 Heavy Electrical / Electronic focus.  I only bought it because it was the required text for a Graduate Course, but hardly used it as I have other Reliability Engeineering texts (Modarres) which cover much of the same material in far more detail and with more clairity.  I would only buy it if studying a course which closesly follows this text, otherwise, I would keep looking 
 My first impression of the first chapter was, "Where are the characters?"  I had to force myself to finish the first chapter, actually.  I don't claim to be a fan of Ms. Jones but I thought Howl's Moving Castle was brilliant.  It was so entertaining and delightful that I don't recall putting it down from start to finish.  That was partially because of her strong characters.  But there was no characters of substance in this book.  This was painfully obvious from the beginning.  I found it difficult to read on because I didn't like any of the characters.  Two reasons why I finished this book: 1) I knew that Howl and Sophie were going to make an appearance EVENTALLY...2) I was stuck at 35,000 feet on a long plane ride with nothing else to read but an airplane magazine trying to sell me duty free liquor or perfume on every other page and no intelligent writing on any of the other pages.  Besides, I had already read the emergency exit and evacuation manual...twice.  In the end, the characters from Howl's that I knew and loved from the first book were metamorphosed into very shallow unbelievable recreations of their former selves, and the hero of the story was just a stranger I had followed along for the ride.  If you loved Howl's, and are expecting wonderful things in Castle, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.  Keep for yourself your own notions of what happened to Howl and Sophie afterwards and be satisfied.  Unless of course, you're stuck on a plane for many hours and have nothing better to read, and you know your emergency evacuation manual by heart, I leave it to your own judgment 
 The book's summary was actually better than the actual read. That's why I decided to try this author for the first time and more than likely this will be the last. I found the conversations between all of the characters boring and unrealistic. The relationship between Caroline and Max was super boring. Here you have an abused woman who could not stand up to her husband, all of a sudden calling the shots with another man who wasn't exactly a wimp.She demands that he be a person of character when she lies about her whole life.  And the scenes where Caroline and Max are very intimate in her apartment with her son in the next room and also in the office, turned my stomach. At the time of this review, I am still plowing through it. It is one of those novels that never seem to end. I keep turning the pages to see when the chapter ends. I'm not sure if I will finish it. I usually do not write reviews, but every so often I feel the need to release frustration and anguish. I can't wait to read something more appealing 
 If you can divorce yourself from the lyrics (and show) that really says nothing... and says it quite crassly, the music is amazing.    I believe the composer is extremely talented and could make a competition quality arrangement of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". Too bad this set of music doesn't say something equally important.  Perhaps next time. 
 This is one of her finer albums, but with this artist that is not saying a great deal.  She has better song selection on this album than on previous ones, but her voice is still no comparison to the other ladies of country music 
 This unit never really worked properly from the start.  I would get the fearsome little balloon in the bottom right of XP that said "Delayed write failed" fairly often.  Then, one day, I plugged it in, and XP would not recognize it at all.  Tried in in three different computers (Linux and XP), and still didn't work.  Popped out the drive inside, hooked it up to the computer directly via the ATA cable, and the drive works find.  So the enclosure was the culprit.  Bad 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Well the title of this book suckered me into purchasing it. This book is a joke and the author should be ashamed of himself. There is nothing easy about this, so the title is very misleading and is an obvious ploy to get you to buy the book. It has the same old problems of your dull, dense, jargon filled college text book. There just isn't enough explanations and the few that are in the book assume to much on the readers behalf and you still end up feeling stumped and disappointed that you didn't learn the skills. I wish I could recommend a different book for you guys out there struggling with ecnm 151 but I just haven't found a good book or an easier way to learn it....or should I say a way to learn it at all. If you want my advice, find the easiest teacher around that gives essay questions on tests or this class will hold you up from getting your degree. Also, study in groups if you can even though this is a luxury given the time constraints of college and insanely fast pace of ecnm classes. One final piece of advice is buy your college text book and start going through it a semester before you take the class because if you get a professor with and attitude and a liking to multiple choice questions your going to have a hard time. There is just too much subject matter here to master in a semester. Your professor mastered it because he/she teaches it, so don't feel bad if you get left behind on this subject. This is a typical college text book and class. They expect you to learn something on your own that you don't know in the first place and believe me you'll get no help from the instructors or this text book. The book seriously lacks explanations through out the text and on some of the more difficult and challenging problems. Oh and author if you read this...get an editor...sheesh. This book is just not a quality product 
 I was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an Englishwoman of privilege over the Western Plains of the American West--what I got was a narrative history of the Mormon religion and its ups and downs.  Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal.  I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean.  
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 I just got this edition from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. For starters, I've been looking up favorite movies that I know extremely well. It seems like every 3rd or 4th review in this guide flat-out gives away either the film's ending or a crucial plot twist! Very strange, and completely bogus IMO. It leaves me confused and disgruntled.   I thought I understood the English national character pretty well, but what's up with these London reviewers? Do their British readers really tolerate, much less appreciate, having the thrill of mystery and discovery just stolen away?   As we all know, here in the US it's taboo to ruin the narrative surprise in any kind of review, unless one explicitly puts a "warning-- spoilers below!" comment in first. Obviously, I support this taboo, and for whatever reason, the Time Out film guide editors have decided to flout it. Their bizarre lack of sympathy for the reader's feelings is simply inappropriate IMO for a film guide, so I rate this work only 2 stars 
 Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 Fukyama, Professor of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins, has managed to take three obvious conclusions that most Americans have already reached - absent PhDs or expensive tuition - and create 240 boring, useless pages.  These conclusions are:  1)The Bush administration wrong made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy.  2)It also badly misjudged global reaction.  3)The Bush administration's third error was failing to appreciate the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.  The fact that Fukuyama was a neoconservative supporter does not change the triviality of the conclusions; it does, however, demonstrate that, unlike President Bush, he is open to accepting contrary information.  A total waste of time, money, and paper 
 I read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them. In addition to this book, I purchased Illustrator CS Killer Tips and Adobe Illustrator CS Idea Kit. Now, not to the insult the author, but this book was horrifying. I felt like I was reading a boring, difficult college textbook! I'm not new to Adobe or the interface, and I self-taught myself Elements and Photoshop. I must say that I was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid, visual detail, and failure to get me intrigued - how could I be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork? I have to find another Illustrator book so I actually learn something...what a dissapointment! The CD was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on CD. Plus, some of the lessons were advertisements for Steuer's online classes. Ha! The only good thing was the art that it did have was in color, and color is good - which is why I gave it one more star than I would've. If you buy it, don't open the CD so you have the option of returning it 
 This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
 I bought a new Desktop PC installed with Vista.  It came preinstalled with McAfee 2007.  I have been using Norton products for years, so I bought a 3 user package of North Internet Security 2007.  For the 60 days of the trial, my computer ran flawlessly.  But it was time to install Norton as McAfee had run its course.  I installed the program last night, which took 45 minutes with the Vista update from Symantec, required updates, restarts and the full system scan.  After this time my computer, which as I said ran flawlessly for 60 days, well now every 60 minutes I get the blue screen of death and a forced restart.  I contacted Symantec's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts (seems that I was not the only one with Norton troubles).   After all this time, the advice I was given was....uninstall and reinstall!!!!  Gee, Einstein, I would have never done that already before I wasted my time contacting you.  But the Symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem.  So I took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...THE SAME BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH but now in under an hour of use!!!  I'm uninstalling this virus and buying a McAfee package ASAP.    Oh also, during the time my computer was not crashing, it ran SLOW!!  It is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram.  And everything you run, Norton needs you to approve its connection...EVERYTHING.  You can allow Norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second, but then you will not be able to user 1/2 of your programs as the geniuses at Norton did not include them in their `safe' list. I regret buying this and only wish I could give it ZERO stars!!! 
 While Ms Shomon's book quotes several CFS doctors, she relies mainly on Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum's advice which includes a barrage of vitamins.  His book is titled "From Fatigued to Fantastic" and he wrote the introduction to Ms. Shomon's.  It bothers me that Ms. Shomon presents many alternative therapies that are highly suspect and cost prohibitive for the most of us.  However, she speaks from experience having suffered from CFS.  It bothers me that she does not mention Kutapressin, an amino acid injection that my doctor and many others in the field use 
 This book is by far not the best book that I have read on pirates.  It is written more for a woman who is feeling bad about her sexuality.  The book is an effort to list every woman, fictional and otherwise, that has ever had a role in maritime history. The book starts out by talking about ancient gods (yes, female gods) that related to the sea.  This discussion is better saved for a book on mythology because it was a good summary of female gods but it did not pertain to pirates.  The book moves on and talks about female pirates through the ages all over the world.  While this is somewhat informative I believe that the significance of these woman pirates in history is way overstated.  Female pirates were very few and far between, and many really shouldn't be considered pirates.  The best part of the book was the discussion of the most netorious women pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny.  These two chapters were interesting and informative but they were also burried in the book.  I would suggest a book that includes but is not limited to woman pirates because the fact is that there were very few woman pirates in history.  The last quarter of the book focused on the politics of the Jolly Roger.  This section helped to save the book but it often repeated and contradicted the first part of the book.  I noticed a few inaccurate statements in this section, but on the whole this section was well done.  This book is not a total waste of time, but it gets off topic and overstates things in my opinion.  Women have played a huge part in world history, just not as pirates 
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 This is a cut and paste job of live concerts and overdubbed studio material that just doesn't make sense. This is the weak point in the Phaedra, Rubycon and Stratosfear line up.  Since one of the concerts Ricochet was taken from was the Croydon concert buy the official Tangerine Bootleg Box Set instead. You can hear the Croydon concert in its entirety as well as many others. Ricochet is just a plain bummer and the irritating vocal effects that were no way a part of any of their concerts have got to go. If you've got the money spend it on the box set instead 
 In reading Six Black Presidents: Black Blood : White Masks USA I was struck by the need of the author to acquire the men that are reviewed in the book. These men are people, they are not posessions, however I felt distinctly that I was being asked to give someone away for the purposes of supporting the theories put forth in this work.    While the content is compelling, if true, the lack of primary evidence and fact overshadows this work.    As another reviewer has pointed out, there is a heavy reliance on phrases such as "It is thought..." and "It is believed..."  Qualifying key sentences with these pharses detracts from the reliability of the material as fact.  There also seems to be a reliance on "Post Hoc Ergo Promptor Hoc" (Therefore, because of this) reasoning, which while persuasive, is faulty.  Structurally, the writing style of the author develops a cadance, seldom stumbling, but often bringing this reader to reread portion of the book to see if the mind was carried past a detail that would add clarity to the argument.  While not a bad example of theory, however, the author fails to sell the reader on the premise that these men have enough identifiers to clearly identify them as being Afro-Centric in the ancestry, or in their thoughts. 
 When I heard that Laura Powers was simular to Loreena Mckennit I rushed to get this cd.  I was very disappointed. Laura Powers Has a lovely voice and the songs are good, but she can't compare with Loreena Mckennit and Enya.  She lacks Enya and Loreena's surrealistic sound and Loreena's incredable instrumentation. When you Listen to Enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld. When you listen to Loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics, Shamens and exotic lands.  Laura, although her music is soothing, provides no enchantment. Overall I would not recommend this Cd to anyone 
 I hated this book. I am a fan of Rice's Mayfair Witches series and enjoyed the early works in the Vampire Chronicles, but Rice's later works are long drawn-out snores.  The only one of Rice's books that was more likely to induce catatonia was The Violin.  I also didn't see the point of having Merrick related to the Mayfairs since the only thing they have in common is being witches.  Using dreams of Oncle Julien as a plot device was a cheat and the story would have been better if the Mayfairs had been left out of it altogether.  As for Louis and his melodrama, by the middle of the book, I was more than willing to help him commit suicide if for no other reason than I was tired of his incessent whining.  As for my recommendation:  if you enjoy tedious whining from someone who chose to live forever, are a masochist, or are an insomniac needing a sleep remedy, then this is the book for you.  I, on the other hand, would rather slit my own wrist than read another book by Rice.  
 Gilroy's Black Atlantic is a much stronger piece. In many ways, this title ('Ain't No Black') seems to be working up to the conclusions he draws in Black Atlantic. Also, his writing in this work is not as strong as Black Atlantic. He could definitely use a decent editor who could take out all those extraneous prepositional phrases that he seems to LOVE. He could be a good deal more concise and coherent. 
 I was disappointed by this book.  It held very little new information that I haven't already read in other books.  I ordered it, looked through it reading a few pages in each chapter and then decided to return it.  It's possible that there are redeeming factors but if so, I didn't happen to read those parts 
 There are much better books on this topic.  "Animal Speak" for example.  This book seems like it was a commissioned knock off in order for some publisher to get on the animal totem bandwagon. The information in it is superficial and not based in much.  The authors interject their politics, opinions, and psychic predictions into the material which was not what I was expecting. This book would have to be an introduction or entry-level book 
 I found the author's advice to be overly simplistic - may be fine for parents who are looking for the basics of behavior management, but not very helpful for kids with trickier issues that require more expertise.  The author appears to have a behavioral approach to management which seems geared towards kids with subtle anxiety issues and minimal emotional problems.  Some of her advice is along the lines of methodology we have used in the past which exacerbated my son's problems.  She points out the behavior of a therapist who, supposedly out of frustration at his unmotivated client, made this reluctant child more anxious by forcing her to face her fears - this sounds like a rationalization for clearly inappropriate professional behavior that she suggests was triggered by a difficult client.  Well, then what is the point of psychotherapy, if not to motivate the client through the continuously rational guidance and support of a professional.  Further, the author uses moralistic terminology, such as 'stubborn', to describe children who are reluctant.  I would not endorse the temper and tone of this book.  She does at one point give some rather basic advice for helping children who cannot control their anxious behavior, which suggests to me that most of this book isn't really aimed for children with significant underlying anxiety problems, but rather for sensitive kids who often get labeled as difficult.  The author seems to be suggesting that all these kids need is  some structure and straightening out.  Even so, I've read more empathetic and flexible books regarding spirited, quirky kids that seem to have a better handle on the underlying needs of kids.    The author does categorize dysfunctional thought patterns which could be helpful if you can get past the undertones of the book -that therapists can do no harm unless provoked by the child and family's dysfunction.  Other books I've read do ask the family to take a look at certain patterns but the tone is more inviting to self-inspection because it is easier to foster a trusting relationship with a therapist who takes a less cut and dried behavioral approach.  There were tidbits that were useful in this book, but overall, a huge waste of my money. 
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though 
 This book is a pathetic example of a radical left-wing professor as he rewrites history and political thought before you very eyes. There are numerous errors throughout the book but probably the most egregious is the authors link of Fascism to the right wing. While this may be the political fantasy of any and all true socialists it is far from the truth.  But let's get into the debate immediately and see if we can bring some Fact to this work of fiction.  First of all the author incorrectly calls the German Nazi's a fascist party. This is so absurd that it is easily rebuffed here, but first let me give a little history. The term NAZI was a nickname given to the members of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Socialist is the operative word here.) This is of course Hitler's outfit, which formed the core of the Third Reich. National Socialists are just another variation on the theme of Socialism and they acquired their nickname though a cartoon character, "Ignaz", nicknamed "Nazi" who was the stereotypical Jew. Before the horror of the reality set in, it seemed a good joke on the posturing, parading, clearly anti-Semitic national socialists to share a nickname with a Jewish cartoon character. Later, Stalin thought up the switch of the applying the Italian "fascist" designation to German national socialist in order to erase from memory that the Nazis were, in fact, socialist.  Fascist just for you information, refers to members of an Italian political party, founded and led by Benito Mussolini, who was expelled from the Socialist Party of Italy and went on to start his own. The structure was a copy, the concept a variant of other socialist parties. "Fasces," a bundle of twigs with an ax, were carried before consuls of ancient Rome. Mussolini adopted the symbol, hence the name "fascist."  Other popular names of Socialist parties are Bolshevik's and Communists. It is interesting to note that in Hungary alone, the communist party went through four complete name changes during its tenure. It is an integral part of socialist operational methodology to make an instant switch once a label has been tainted with "mistakes" (such as too many atrocities), or when a new compendium of deceptions is about to be announced.  Regardless of the name that a socialist party chooses they all have the same elements in common. They are as follows:  1. Restriction of Individual Freedom 2. A strong central authority 3. The usurpation of legislative and judicial prerogative by the executive branch of the government 4. Some suspension of property rights.  Since Hitler's party and the Mussolini's party both urged the people to go along with all four of the above premises, both the fascist and the Nazi's (National Socialist German Workers Party) was in reality a Socialistic endeavor. To label it conservative is a glaringly illogical deduction.  Since the author's main conclusion are drawn from such falsehoods the whole book is suspect and can be passed by and nothing but a propaganda front for the new-socialist and their continuing ploy to tar the conservatives with the atrocities of their political kin.  
 Unfortunately it's another dud. With the exception of Other Voices Too (A Trip Back to Bountiful) Nanci's CD's since Flyer have been duds. While I can appreciate an artist wanting to branch out and try something different, many of these songs really don't lend themselves to Nanci's voice. I much prefer her to sing folk, country, country/rock, rockabilly.  Ruby's Arms and Never Be the Sun are the best songs here. Brave Companion of the Road sounds like she's phoning it in. Her voice lacks the passion of the original. I expected Late Night Grand Hotel to also lack the the vocal passion of the original, but surprisingly, it did not. However, I still prefer the orignal version, especially the musical arrangement.  Back to back songs Grapefuit Moon and Please Call Me Baby are a long and boring 8-1/2 minutes.  The recycling of songs is getting annoying. There are 4 songs on here that Nanci has already recorded.   There was another 1 star review here on Amazon called "Ruby's Rotten Egg". Where has it gone? I don't know. It seems that Nanci has a fiercly loyal fanbase that floods Amazon with 5 star reviews and slams people who disagree. I too am a loyal fan, but I will not give a five star review for a 1 star CD.  So there 
 "The neo-conservatives run the Pentagon", so says one commentator recently. From the news reports, no matter how distorted they might be, and from some of the literature that has been pouring forth from those who describe themselves as neo-conservatives, one could believe the commentator's statement. They exude great confidence in their philosophy, provocative as it is, and they are unashamed of presenting it with gusto. But underneath their rhetoric and bombast one observes a conspicuous absence: the absence of the (Sartrian) belief that philosophy and action are one. Indeed, they are comfortable with putting pen to paper, and consequently whipping up hysteria and zeal for armed conflict, but they do not participate in that conflict. Readers will find an excellent compilation of their philosophies in this collection of articles and excellent examples of intellectual and moral cowardice. Space and time prohibit a detailed overview of them, so attention will be drawn to the two worst of them (the weighting scheme used by this reviewer to judge this was very difficult):  In his article "Beyond the Axis of Evil: Additional Threats from Weapons of Mass Destruction", John R. Bolton discusses what he considers to be the greatest threat to national security, namely state sponsorship of terrorists that use weapons of mass destruction. The article states the obvious, and has many unsubstantiated claims. One of these is the assertion that Iraq has developed, produced, and stockpiled biological warfare agents and weapons. In addition, they have developed, produced, and stockpiled chemical weapons. Also, Syria has been known to have a chemical warfare program. And Cuba has a well-developed biomedical industry, and that the US "believes" that Cuba has a limited biological warfare research and development effort. How does Bolton know all these things? What kinds of biological agents did they develop and how much of them did they have? What kinds of chemical agents? Bolton gives no references and the skepticism of this reviewer regarding these claims increased after completing the article. One fact though is beyond dispute: Bolton has not yet volunteered for military service to help America win "the fight to root out and destroy terror." He states in this article that America is leading this fight. Perhaps, but America is doing it without his assistance on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. Bolton, like so many others of his persuasion, has excused himself from doing the real fighting. His hands are too shaky and his intestinal fortitude too lacking for such an endeavor.   But by far the best example of vague and floating abstractions comes in the article by Condoleezza Rice entitled "The President's National Security Strategy". Rice is a Lieutenant Keefer with XX chromosomes, a person who keeps her skirts nice and starched and clean, even in the Iraq War. One will not find any Iraqi sand embedded into the fibers of her crisp, designer suits. What one will find, and this is exemplified perfectly in this article, is a capacity for stating much but proving little. She speaks of "existential threats", of the "crystallization" of our vulnerabilities after 9/11 and of threats being "fully materialized." These are certainly colorful metaphors, and an example of a sterile intellect hiding behind tact and prudence. They are never defined or subject to clarification, in spite of her statement in the article that "clarity is a virtue." Clarity is not to be found in this article, but what can be found is language that smoothes over the perturbations that real facts can induce when presented to an administration that is unprepared and ill-equipped mentally to deal with them. Rice speaks against the tension between the `realistic' and `idealistic' schools of foreign affairs, and asserts "these categories obscure reality." Her grasp of reality and facts though seems shaky at best, totally obscuring historical realities. This is readily apparent when she states that "we do not seek to impose democracy on others." Considering the carnage in the illegal and immoral war against Iraq, a war that Rice made happen and steadfastly supports, to make it a "stable democracy", this is indeed an odd statement to make, and is indicative of how shielded Rice is from the true realities of the world.   Indeed, throughout this book you will find a sizable collection of trembling hands, weak intellects, and yellow abdomens. But one thing you will not find in the book is an article that implores those in the neo-conservative camp to sign up for combat duty in the military. Nay, you will not find such an article, nor one that implores the sons and daughters of these individuals to do the same. They leave the horrors of warfare to those that do not think or act like they do.  
 When I saw this DVD- I just had to get it, because my husband and I remembered how hilarious that one sketch was - the one where he pretends to be a white man.  But after seeing it again after all these years, I must say that our society has "outgrown" its humor.  It just isn't as funny because we've all grown to accept much edgier comedy, with the likes of Dave Chapelle, Carlos Mencia, etc.  It still was amusing and brought back good memories from back in the day, but it just wasn't as hilariously shocking as it once was 
 If your looking for detailed guidance on some of the problems of diabetics you want find it here. Was this written by people knowledgable in the field? Examples: If a antibiotic salve takes more  than a few days to work call your doctor; slow healing is directly related to poor blood sugar control. Otherwise all cursory stuff you might find in pamphlets at the doctor's office 
 Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference 
 This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet 
 Who is this recording for? Surely not for Billy Joel fans, who would undoubtedly prefer Billy doing the actual singing. For that matter, why would anyone want to listen to 60+ minutes of Billy Joel covers? This is the most pointless cast album since Contact. Movin' Out is a similarly visual show the appeal of which lies not in Michael Cavanaugh's admittedly distinctive performance. It's no wonder you see used copies of Movin' Out is used records stores everywhere 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 Sorry, I think this album sucks. To give you some context, "Walk on Water" is probably the song that first got me interested in dance/trance. I quickly found better offerings, namely DJ Encore & Engelina, E-type, Da Buzz, Lasgo, etc. But, I was psyched about a new effort from Milk Inc. Unfortunately, it bores me to tears. They have no real sense of melody. The songs are uninspiring. Can't recommend it. 
 i kept waiting for him to stop writing about his research and start writing the history of the screwdriver 
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 It's hard for some to believe, but it is what it is. Christianity is not what it was 50 years ago, which is not what it was 150, and so on. It is not the same religion it was during the crusades, nor the inquisitions. It changes with the times. It is a creation of man and controlled by man. Christianity itself is an evolution of judaism. People should be content with people who are kind and caring and good hearted, despite any religion or lack there of they may have. 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 This book is all tired re-hash from the first edition. Very incorrect mechanical drawings, most of the circuits don't work, poorly researched with many error! This book will frustrate you so much, you'd be better off buying a book on origami :-) Some of the newer authors have got it right - try books by Myke Predko, John Iovine or Karl Williams - way better 
 I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts 
 My parents read this book as they were considering separating.  It convinced them that there was no reason to resolve their differences, and that our family would be somehow stronger.  It absolutely gives unhappy people the unfounded expectation that if they can just be friendly with each other, negative effects can be completely avoided.  In the end it made my parents separation all the more painful for me and my adult siblings, because it built an expectation that divorce would be easy on everyone.  When it wasn't, the only response was to blame us kids, because they were working really hard at their "good" divorce 
 I watched this film recently after having enjoyed the soundtrack for years.  I found the film to be weak on suspense, character development, and pacing.  The plot was nearly absent.  I suppose the style of photography and editing could be useful to a student of film history, but for the rest of us who actually want to see a movie that we can be pulled in by and enjoy, this is an utter waste of time. I don't know how Cortazar felt about this adaptation of his work, but I'm sure it wasn't a happy feeling 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 This book has very little to do with money a very much to do with sending money to the church. I bought a copy for each of my girls, 16 and 18 years old, each of them very spiritual, and they were both very turned off by the "preachy" context of the book. In fact, the 18-year-old told me she felt like she learned nothing about money, and as for the spiritual side, there are better books for that as well. She was especially turned off by one passage that recommended one way of making more money is giving more to the church 
 I enjoyed other, more recent, books by William Poundstone and I decided to try this. I was very disappointed. I am sure the fact that the book was written twenty years ago contributes to my disappointment: many subjects present only nostalgic value for some people and mostly outdated. Don't look for revelations - the author is mostly speculating on the subject (secrets mostly will stay secrets). In our time much more and better information could be found on the Internet. I gave it two stars just for some historical data that I found sometimes interesting 
 I would strongly recommend you to get "The Mahabharata" retold by C.Rajagopalachari. This is the best version of the Mahabhatata you can ever read!!! Please do not buy the version by William buck.. 
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 Unfortunately, the only chapter do address the 9 natural laws of leaderhsip is the first one...after that, the author moves into the quantum leadership theory for the remaining part of the book.  The book is filled  with great information but is is buried deep within complicated,  over-technical sentences.  The author seems to be out to impress other  authors with his use of $10 words than to get a worthwhile set of  information to the reader.  It is very unfortunate since there is very good  info in this book but it is soooo hard to get to it.  He should try to  write this book over again and let a normal person read it first before  publishing it! Don in Denver 
 Kofi Annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that.  Kofi Annan: The Peacekeeper is ironic in that Annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the UN, support for Arafar, etc.  Jeff Jacoby recently wrote that he is basically a symptom of UN's sickness.  Jacoby noted that just last week, Annan  woke up to a Wall Street Journal column by Glenn Harlan Reynolds, publisher of the influential InstaPundit website, urging that he be replaced by Vaclav Havel, the much-admired former president of the Czech Republic.  In The New York Times, op-ed eminence William Safire reviewed the revelations that link the massive oil-for-food scandal to Annan's own family: Until this year, his son Kojo was getting monthly payments from a firm that had a major oil-for-food contract with the UN -- even though he'd left the company in 1998. The corruption enveloping the UN will not begin to dissipate, Safire wrote, until Annan resigns, "having, through initial ineptitude and final obstructionism, brought dishonor on the Secretariat of the United Nations."  Meanwhile, the latest National Review was out, with its cover photo of Annan and the headline, in large red letters: "You're Fired!" An editorial inside insisted that "Annan should either resign, if he is honorable, or be removed, if he is not," while an essay by Nile Gardiner, a former aide to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, explained why "Kofi's hour is up." With his record, Gardiner observed, "if Annan were the CEO of a Fortune 500 company . . . he would have been forced to resign months ago."  On Wednesday came another call for Annan's ouster, this one from the chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has amassed evidence that Saddam Hussein used stolen oil-for-food dollars to underwrite terrorism and suborn at least one senior UN official. It is "abundantly clear" that Kofi Annan should resign, Senator Norm Coleman said. "As long as Mr. Annan remains in charge, the world will never be able to learn the full extent of the bribes, kickbacks, and under-the-table payments that took place under the UN's collective nose."  But odds are the world won't much care about getting to the bottom of the latest UN scandal. UN scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage. There was no global uproar when the brutal regime in Libya was chosen to chair the UN's Human Rights Commission. Nothing happened to the UN after its troops allowed Serbs to slaughter 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the "safe haven" of Srebrenica. Sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the UN goes -- the latest involves charges of rape, child abuse, and prostitution by UN personnel in the Congo -- but they never cause heads to roll in Turtle Bay. Annan himself became secretary general despite his failure, when he headed the UN's peacekeeping operations, to pay attention to warnings of genocide in Rwanda.  Why should anything be different this time? Oil-for-food may be the greatest international rip-off of modern times, it may have strengthened one of the world's bloodiest dictators, but if history is any guide, the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does. By week's end, in fact, dozens of governments, including all the permanent members of the Security Council save the United States, had publicly rallied to Annan's support. Scandal or no scandal, he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term.  Which is just as well. Annan is merely a symptom of the UN's sickness, not the cause of it. His resignation would do nothing to reform the UN into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned. Better that Annan remain in place as a symbol of UN fecklessness and failure, and a spur to those who can envision something better.  The UN is a corrupt institution, one that long ago squandered whatever moral legitimacy it had. The UN's founding documents venerate justice and human rights, but for the past 40 years, the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states -- essentially the Afro-Asian Third World -- most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights.  Inside the United Nations, there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy: Each gets exactly one vote in the General Assembly. The reason the UN indulges vicious regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, and Cuba is that they are members in good standing, and most other governments lack the courage to cross them. The UN cannot be fixed unless that changes -- and that isn't going to change.  Kofi is a bad man 
 This was used as the textbook for my introduction to nuclear engineering class. While the information as present and relevant, it is presented in a meandering way that doesn't tell you what's important. The problems presented at the end of each chapter expect you to remember numbers and formulas that may have only been mentioned in passing 7 chapters ago. Further, each step of the problems has been rounded, making the final answer very different from that gained by simply doing the entire equation all at once. This may have been understandable when the first edition was written, but we have progressed significantly beyond the slide-rule, and the new generation of nuclear engineers is operating with much more sophisticated technology. The available instructor's answer guide to the problems does not even give the location of equations and numbers, nor is there a comprehensive appendix with all forumlas and numbers 
 Compelled by my interest in the French Revolution to read everything and anything about it, I stumbled upon this novel after seeing it mentioned in the Wall Street Journal, I believe. Now Miss Davis is a very creative writer, nothing against her personally, but I was appalled to see the historical liberties taken.  The most minimal research was neglected. The way the novel is laid out, in short vignettes, rather reminds me of Vidal's format for her brilliant and very accurate novel "Trianon." I actually felt reminded of "Trianon," while deprived of the masterful character studies, and instead treated to sad, tawdry scenes of Marie-Antoinette's bedroom ordeals. I think it would be enjoyable if  approached as poetry. It is amusing to me how so many novels take an introspective approach to Marie-Antoinette, in either a mythical journal or an ongoing examination of conscience, when by all accounts the queen was a lively, extroverted lady, not one for mulling things over. Not badly written, but not very romantic, either. A weak attempt at a historical novel but fine as literature 
 I went back and BMGed this one since everyone and their brother gave Im not dead such good ratings.  Another stupid moved by me, never buy or listen to the majority, I like the opposite of them 
 March 17, 2006 Amazon Review  Say it ain't so Joe (Disappointing)  "Chances are you have seen and read a lot of other books, books that promise to give you the 'secrets,' the magic, the inspiration.  You probably know a lot about how to hype yourself by looking in the mirror every morning and repeating certain phrases to yourself... and some other magical-power expressions and attitude builders...But let's face it.  What you want to know is how to sell real products and services now.  And most of those authors never sold much in their lives except their books."  The above quote is from the first page of Joe Girard's book "How to Sell Anything to Anybody".  The impression you get is that Joe is a straight shooter and he's going to tell you about real strategies that will really help you sell, not some touchy-feely self-help garbage, and he comes through.  However, the same cannot be said of "How to Sell Yourself".  Now remember the quip about looking in the mirror, he doesn't explicitly ridicule the practice, but it's implied, and it's almost like a joke between you and Joe where he's saying "Yes that's all fine and good for them, but we know better".  So, imagine my surprise when he advocates in his "How to Sell Yourself Book" that you "Put up a little card where you can see it every day, a card that says I am Number One.  Look in the mirror every morning and tell yourself I am my own best salesperson" (pg. 26).  Say it ain't so Joe.  Tell me you didn't just say that.  Tell me you didn't just suggest such a pathetic and ridiculous thing.  Needless to say, I stopped reading the book right there.  If that's the sort of advice you are looking for then maybe this is the book for you, but I was looking for something that wasn't psycho-babble self-help garbage.  Why did I buy the book then?  Because I read Joe's "How to Sell Anything to Anybody" and was sold on his straight shooting, practical advice.  I thought his next book might have some more interesting or valuable things to say; however, I was disappointed.  It comes across as ungenuine.  The impression is that someone offered Joe a truckload of cash to write another book, and even though he didn't have much else to say after his first book, he agreed and this book is the result.  So, I'd definitely recommend Joe's "How to Sell Anything Book" but I can't recommend this book. 
 I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money 
 The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.    All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.    The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment.  
 I purchased the updated, 3rd edition recently and anyone who can actually understand the contents and retain the information, my hat is off to you. I have been a personal trainer for over 7 years and thought this book would supply me with some extra knowledge. Was I wrong. Way too technical. Way too many references and studies with many times contradicting themselves. Very non user friendly. I have read paragraphs to co-workers who are more advanced than me and even they shook their heads. DO NOT BUY if you are looking to advance your personal training skills and knowledge. I have passed several certifications and consider myself fairly knowledgable, but this book left me scratching my head and saying WHAT???? 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 If only it were so simple -- answer a few questions, connect the dots -- presto:  so, THAT'S who I am!  Ironically, if "personalty" was so easily calculated by the method created by this team of professionals, they'd be out of business.  Nevertheless, for the self-investigators among us looking for the quick fix, it's this book -- or, for something even quicker, try the paragraph personality bytes under your astrological sign in the slick magazines.. 
 I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally 
 I bought the book several years ago and listened to John Talbott and others that have been harping on this topic forever.  Sure, a boom or bust will happen eventually but who knows when and how bad it will be.  In the meantime houses may double, triple, quadruple, etc.  The fact of the matter is many bubbleheads have been calling the top for several years and each year they are proven grossly wrong.    "The Coming Crash in the Housing Market" was written in 2003.  In the meantime, house values have doubled and my personal savings to buy a house are now worth 50 cents on the dollar.  Thanks Mr. Talbott!  In order for Talbott to be remotely creditable housing would first need to plunge to 2003 levels, roughly a 50% drop, and then it would need to fall more on top of that to account for what he argues in his book.     The sad thing is that when housing eventually does see a modest drop, the media will immediately praise Talbott and others like him as great visionaries.   Just wait and see.  The lesson I took away from this is that Talbott and other bubbleheads are fortunetellers and, in reality, have absolutely no clue what is going to happen.   They capitalize on peoples fears and make money doing so.   Save your money and do not reward the guessers with the purchase of this book and books like it. 
 This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists 
 I assumed any Peterson guide would be good enough to provide a solid field reference.  This was an unpleasant surprise -- it is well short of the mark.  For starters, approximately a sixth of the book was bound upside down.  (I did not have enough time before my trip to return it.)  Next, the number of plates seems particularly limited and, finally, the number of birds covered seems far too limited.  The first two entries I went to while in the field irritatingly simply referenced other Peterson guides with no further detail.  Note to publisher: this diminishes the Peterson brand 
 The only thing exciting about the book is the title.  I could not wait to get the book and read it.  I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever.  There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole.  I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off 
 Living near McCarter Theater in Princeton my AP English class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for Broadway. Afterwards, my teacher asked what we all thought, of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the "favorite" students knew which opinion to take. They all raised their hands and said they loved it to, however, no one could say why.  Why not?  Because everyone hated it. I was the first to open the flood gate. "I thought it was ridiculous.  It has no real substance to the plot." "That's because the language is the point" "Well the language is the worst part.  Why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors?  Especially ones that stupid ('Does the bicicle miss the boy?')?" My teacher flipped out at this. "You don't understand!  That's what literature is all about!  Metaphors!" The woman, asides from being a gigantic b**ch, was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on Jimmy Smitts. A month later, the New York Times, reviewed the play after its Broadway premiere.  They said pretty much exactly what I thought.  I was going to bring the review into class, but why bother?  The woman already hated me.  PS. One earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped.  During a Q&A afterwards, Emily Mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this.  I agree with the reviewer that they clearly didn't come to a good solution 
 I suppose I should have realised that if I hated "L'Avventura", I would probably hate this, too. Just wish I'd thought of that before buying it. Ponderous, slow, self-consciously arty. A milestone in cinematic history, and all that, but terribly off putting and, in some instances, terribly obvious in its ennui. There will be much eye-rolling on your part. You probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course. Really.   Good package by Criterion, though. 
 How does one become a writer? Well, from Updike's perspective all you need is some mindless ambition, coupled with a merely technical understanding of literature and writing.  If one is to be great, then one must follow Updike's formula on creativity which is: the more unintelligible the better, and to the extent that the reader is frustrated and baffled, made to feel insecure and dumbfounded by an empty metaphor is the extent to which your novel succeeds.  An author, Updike leads us to believe, sits high above in the stratosphere, writing tome upon tome of messianic goodness for the edification of the ignorant flock, who can't help but be awed by said author's transcendent knowledge.  Updike is obviously on another level.  Perhaps if I develop a megalomaniac delusional sense of self I could write just like him.  That would be groovy 
 In all meaning of the word stay away 
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring.  I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar. Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, "There is NO way he'll get out of this" or "That would never happen."  I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a "spy" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief.  However, this one passed those limits 
 THIS ALBUM IS WEAK, AND VERY AVERAGE. FIRST OFF, ITS PRETTY MUCH A CAZ ALBUM FEATURING OTHERS, AND CAZ IS ONE WACC RAPPER. THAT DUDE IS TERRIBLE. THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 3 GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM OUT OF 22. BONE THUGS HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN TO SIGN WEAK RAPPERS, SO ITS NOT A SURPRISE THEY DROPPED THIS TRASH. THE DVD WAS BORING, SHOWING WEAK FOOTAGE OF BONE THUGS CONCERT, AND FOLLOWING CAZ THROUGH HIS RAP STORY. HE TALKING TRASH ABOUT THE GAME, AND XZIBIT, BUT THAT GUY CAN NEVER COMPARE TO THOSE TRUE MC'S, AND STR8 WESTCOAST LEGENDS.CAZ IS JUST A FAKE WANNABE GANGSTA. THAT FOOL DONT KNOW NOTHIN ABOUT THIS CRIPPIN. HE A STR8 BUSTA ON CRIP! DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE, ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE WHOLE DVD IS THE PART WHERE THEY HAVE THAT MEXICAN SIGNER SINGING THAT SONG "SHE SCREAMS" THAT SONG IS SO COLDDDDD JACK 
 Marx'claims about the timing and the manipulative origins of nationalism do not quite fit the facts. I will show that one consequence of Marx's thesis may be a variant of Hugh Trevor Roper's view of  Hitler as a traditional European statesman. Viz., Hitler fostered German development toward an enlightened society [the Federal Republic?] by conjuring religious [/ethnic] disharmony to consolidate Nazi power. [Of course, as Sauer has shown about the Gauliter system, fascists aimed at a return to pre-modern, de- centralized, charismatic forms of organization. So not all nationalism serves a centralization aim.]  Marx's  mistaken thesis rests upon tendentious examples. Neo- [Karl] Marxists have maintained since mid- 2oth century that elites manipulated antecedent nationalism to achieve political cohesion against foreign enemies. T Marx merely takes the thesis that nationalism was manipulated [e.g., in WWI] to subvert class solidarity, next internalizes it to apply to intra-state cohesion, then projects this twisted commonplace backward as a sort of genetic fallacy. Rather,the most portentous exclusionary[eliminationist?] European nationalism was ultimately the Germanic variety. But its genesis (e.g., Herder, Goethe- the latter being the quintessence of liberalism qua Aufklarung] plainly predated any serious political centralization efforts beyond Joseph II's. Marx' move here must be to claim there since there was no nation-building before Bismarck, ergo the prior nationalist movement [e.g., resistance to Napoleon] does not qualify as nationalism of the right sort [did not culminate in liberal state?? but cf the Hitler rumination above]. Ergo, the German experience is disqualified as a counter- example and so cannot count as evidence against his statist incubation thesis. But dismissing this counter- example by disallowing it demonstrates that, at bottom, his thesis is a mere recommendation about how historians should use the honorific "modern nationalism". That is, his enterprise is revealed as attemppting to establish a stipulative definition of nationalism. It is not a historical account of nationlism's development. Alternatively, he must modify his conclusion so that royal centralization did not originate nationalism, but deformed it into his procrustean mold. But when did state- induced nationalism arise, even in German lands?      What about Marx' temporal claim that nationalism was the product of [royal] centralization in the early modern epoch?  The dynamic of centralization, particularly in France [but also in the Holy Roman Empire] began centuries before. It did not start with exclusionary cohesion/ religious factionalism in the 15th century, but with a conflict with the papacy in the 11th. The Investiture Contest with the Pope ostensibly concerned the king/ emperor's rights vs that of the Pontiff in nominating bishops to be invested with consecrated ecclesiastical -- and political/ temporal-- authority. As bishops were among the super- castellans of that feudal epoch, this effort to create a national church - one in liege service to central authority- was at least a progenitor of the nationalist phenomenon Marx attempts to explain. Not a mass movement, Marx objects?  Perhaps the later Reformation era factionalism mobilized and augmented the nationalism implicit in the 11th and intervening centuries. But nationalism was not the product of that later conflict 
 I was happy at first that my wife had bought this book.  At first, I thought it would be good for her to understand me.  Then, I asked her if I could read it, and was strongly irritated at the generalizations and  labeling that were used.  The fault in this book lies in the way the author  drew a box around his picture of men, and made it seem as though all men  are that way.  I was most strongly irritated at his chapter on temptation.   In fact, according to him, I would either be a homosexual or a liar, since  I have not ever looked at another woman with sexual thoughts.  I have,  indeed, struggled with same sex desires, but being a homosexual is living  the lifestyle.  This was definitely not the book for my wife and I, who  were desperately trying to understand each other.  I am a man who is  definitely outside this author's idea of what men are like.  I am deeply  sensitive, creative, romantic, and do not fall into his categorization.  I  wish I could find an author who realizes that men are changing.  We are not  the same men that were here 50 years ago.  We are becoming more open and  more sensitive.  Unfortunately, many men think that they have to be the way  this book says we are, because the author makes them think that it's the  norm.  I give the author one star for good intentions 
 Normally I would say it is hard to go wrong watching a movie with either Samuel L. Jackson or Julianne Moore acting in them...I was wrong. Though they have both played similar characters before, Jackson a cop and Moore a mother with missing child. They did it much better in the other movies. They are not believable in this movie.  Jackson plays a detective in the projects where he must deal with a case that starts to cause racial tension. The case consists of a carjacking/kidnapping of a white child by an African American man. As the racial tension continues to build, the police get nowhere. Enter Edie Falco who plays the founder and head of a missing child research team. The movie does have a twist that we slowly are let into.... but too slowly in my estimation.  Though this was drawn out and the wrong cast chosen. The underlying story is one that shows how a community can be torn apart by differences and also pull together for a common cause. And it does not take much to change the balance of which way it will go. 
 Larry is funny in the way that Joe Theisman's leg break is funny. If you want racist trash disguised as "aw shucks, I'm just being honest," humor then this book is for you. Of course his jokes do contain farts which I find endlessly amusing. Just not enough.  Tera Delu 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 I am a huge fan of Enigma and have all four of their previous albums, which are absolutely excellent.  This is why I was so disappointed with this one.  It is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up.  The entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying, harsh, distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears.  It seems to me that in this music Michael Cretu has become a modern-day German full of Angst and self pity that no one could care less about.  Boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album 
 I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment 
 This was a complete waste of money.  A little phamplet of a book written by a very spoiled woman who is in love with herself more than anyone else 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 Well, I researched the author and she isn't "world famous," or even well known, for that matter. The writing is contrived and the overall feeling is that Katie is a big overgrown teeanager, pardon the pun. While we bigger girls need to stick together, I felt the advice was a bit dated 
 One minor problem for me, that is evidently not a problem for many others, was the art.  I was put off by the blotchy, surrealistic, color-schemes, which were distracting, and rarely added to whatever charm the line-drawings themselves possessed.  Getting past that, I was able to enjoy the silly story.  Humor is often generated when the tension is created by horror or fear, but then is punctured by the absurdity of the situation.    All decent people should be horrified by the idea of buying and selling other human beings, in pursuit of materialistic goals, as though they were mere objects.  Here, however, the absurdity of the situation breaks the ice.  We know that virtually no real child would want to sell his or her father.  Moreover, the idea of this rather useless dad permitting himself to be bartered all over town by children, without ever once looking up from his newspaper, is completely nonsensical.  I suppose children might laugh (just as I did).  Another saving grace is that, even though the story is told from the point of view of the creepy little sociopath of a son who sells his dad, there were other characters for me to root for.  I was completely on the side of the little sister, who (quite properly) objects and protests the scheme.  She (quite properly) rats him out to his mother, who is also suitably furious, and makes this creepy little materialist promise never to sell his dad again.  Morever, since the bulk of the story concerns the quest to RECOVER the bartered-off dad, even the boy is doing the right thing for much of the narrative.     But then comes the TWIST.  You see, he never promised anything about not selling his little sister.  The last panel shows the brother's huge shadow, mouth open with glee, reaching like an ogre for this little girl, who looks small, isolated, helpless.    This time, I did not laugh.  Why not?  This time, sadly, the absurdity of the situation does not puncture the horror.  It is not absurd enough, and it is too horrific.  We do not think the boy is joking.  Earlier in the tale, we actually saw the little sister bound and gagged by the older brother to prevent her ratting on him to Mom (a disturbing enough scene in its own right).  Moreover the pictures make the boy look much larger and stronger than his little sister --  the situation lacks the obvious jokiness of bartering off one's much-larger dad while he never looks up from his newspaper.  Even the THREAT of selling your little sister to your friends is potentially a nasty and frightening form of abuse.      Gaiman's afterword tells us the story reflects real and bitter hostility that existed between two of his children, and further reflected a similar bitter hostility between himself and his own sister.  This eerily suggests that the final panel might have been inspired by genuine malice.  How, then is it a joke?  If bitter hostility between siblings is a problem -- and it often is -- ought not the message, in a picture book ostensibly marketed for children, be a bit more positive?  Payback time, little girl!  I guess she shouldn't have ratted out her creepy older brother.  Funny to Gaiman, perhaps, but not to me 
 As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest 
 If you expect an action filled novel like the Ender series written by Scott Orson Card, you will be greatly disappointed.  I bought this book based on all the rave reviews I read here and I felt like a sucker.  I could not finish reading this book because it bored me to tears.  There are dialogs after dialogs, but no action.  If this is a movie, there will be only one scene in the whole movie, of people talking to each others. So be warned!! 
 It's hard to bellive there are people so gullible as to believe this convicted felon.  IMHO he's a crook and a con ma 
 It does not like rapid changes in temperature.  When the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back.   All of that is moot, because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors, though it is a mere 45 degrees outside. Sent it back 
 This book is a mishmash of banal trivialities alternating with the author's relentless self-aggrandizement. Don't waste your money 
 I'd rather hear luther any day. this is so watered down....was givin to me as a gift and i should have returned i 
 This is a good book if you live in larger areas.  Rural areas do not apply to most of the book.  The best tip however was the detail about David's Bridal and their lack of customer service.  Very true 
 Signs that you are about to make a bad purchase.  1 star is the highest rating. I of course didn't read anything. I saw the show on Cartoon Network and immediately ran to Best Buy to purchase every DVD available in the series.  Funny thing is, there was a gap in the display where volume 4 would've been.  I shuffled through the box covers and found a 4th different cover.  Finding no other volumes I took to register took the dvds home, only to find out I had purchased volume 1,2,3,and 5???? watched 1-3 immediatley.  Can't break continuity, must proceed to another store to buy volume  4. Get to store and hmm...Volume 4 Recollections???? Okay maybe they have 1 recap episode, it happens.  Get home look at back of box.  This is the same description on volume 2???  And my soul was consumed as I broke the seal rendering the disc completely unreturnable and discovered the awful truth that THIS WAS A 4 EPISODE RECAP OF THE PREVIOUS 14 EPISODES.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  OWW OWWW  AAAAAARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Release the hounds of hell on the ones responsible for this abomination.  The show is great. If you want to be cheap just buy this disc instead of the first three, though you will lose the soul of the story.  You have been forwarned 
 "Men Like Women...." consists of one frightfully banal cliche after another, surrounded by acres of white space.

 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 "Moby Dick" has been hyped far beyond its worth because it was the first American novel with philosophic pretentions. You could read the first ninety pages, then skip to the last ten and miss nothing but a binful of symbols. It's gauche, jejune, primitive, a graphic novel without illustrations--one of the few American novels improved as a Classics comic book. Joseph Conrad covers the same material better, and Persig better than either of them. This is a wearying tome that no one would read if it weren't assigned reading. It will teach you . . . nothing 
 A very detailed lesson on how not to undertake a sea crossing. Peter describes in great detail his lack of preparedness and his lessons wasted. The truly amazing thing in this story is that he survived and then is  foolish enough to tell the tale. A great read for anyone contemplating  voyaging and most instructive in lessons not learned 
 For the record, I have not read this book. I just finished watching a presentation of some sort of award to this author on television, followed by his views on opiate addiction and then what can only be characterized as an utterly contrived Q&A session.  That being said. Try reading the very first line, provided by Amazon.com: "Man is the only creature capable of self-destruction, and only man decides in full consciousness to do what is bad, even fatal, for him."  I am quite certain that if this line is suitable to lead the entirety of this work... it is, to a degree, and if the editor and author have half of a brain to work with, quite exemplary of the ultimate end of the piece.  Ask yourself: Can I actually, purposefully, do evil unto my self. Dalrymple asserted, in his speech this evening, that addicts are quite simply victims of bad choices and in fact have a great understanding of the possible outcomes of heroin use and addiction.  Ask yourself again: Would I, with full understanding of the nature of Heroin and the likelihood of addiction, choose Heroin? --No... no you would not. And in part the author has already contradicted him self. Not the least part of the fallacy pertains to the fact that he quotes (incorrectly, which may be a clue to his true understanding) Aristotle... who would agree with his predecessors... Plato and Socrates... in that no being willfully does damage or evil unto itself... only in mistake can a being cause harm to its self...  Now here is what I will have to assume will be the largest and most direct argument against the author. The nature of initial drug use has nearly nothing to do with understanding the facts, weighing the possible outcomes and deciding to use the drug. In fact, as any true researcher will quickly find, they reasons for drug use, the real reasons, are often quite different than the vocally expressed reasons given by the drug addicts (incarcerated) that the author had interviewed.   There is a very good chance, that under strict scrutiny, most drug addicts will have a very difficult time finding the exact reason that they began down their path. The reason for this being, that they themselves did not understand entirely why it made sense... because it didn't. There are an enormous number of reasons that a human being takes any action in any situation. the bulk of which they are never 'fully conscious.'   The author blatantly ignores the fact, in fact he asserts the opposite, that no one takes a drug thinking that they will end up and addict and ruin their life. No conscious being would be willing, let alone able, to make such a choice.   Hence, he fallaciously believes that drug use is a conscious choice in the life of a man... when in fact, it is an extreme combination of a staggering number of past events, family upbringing, social norms, cultural biases, personal accountability, accepted prejudices, level of personal thought and exploration, lifestyle and stress. Just to name a fraction.   To characterize the addict, the social user, or even the potential customer with a brush so broad as to downplay the very ability of mankind to think...(not think well... but think at all) is to convict the entirety of mankind, not just the addict, of total retardation; to characterize us all as inferior primal beings with absolutely no understanding of reason, logic and the like. Read the book... tell me if I am wrong.

 ...A 17-year-old boy has an affair with an actress in her twenties, who then marries the boy's uncle.  Fourteen years later, the boy, now 31, is back -- and has an affair with the 14-year-old daughter of his uncle and his own ex-mistress.  Then, for good measure, he runs off with another ex-mistress, this one his uncle's.  I'm a big Andrew Lloyd Webber fan in general, but I can see why this one is widely considered an embarrassment.  Even in these relaxed times, an affair (Alex-Jenny) that constitutes child molestation, with an element of incest thrown in, is bound to put many people off their feed.  Go back to EVITA and PHANTOM, and forward to SUNSET BOULEVARD.  Show your respect for Andrew by giving this one a miss 
 This book is very poorly written from a number of perspectives.    The timeline is atrocious. For example, you'll read about the death of Brian Epstein, then 50+ pages later he appears again in another section with no indication that the timeline has changed.  This jumping is very frequent, and appears all over the book.  Poorly organized.  Opinion is everywhere.  The author feels the need to inject his commentary on the Beatles' behaviors.  Of course, don't expect any analysis of WHY Lennon was so moody, or WHY McCartney was dominating, or why Starr and Harrison were resentful.  Don't even expect to get enough information to let you make some of your own conclusions either.  Another key failing in this book is the way it quickly glosses over key events leaving you wanting to know more - just one example is the whole period during which they recorded Revolver - the very title of the book!  Another example is when Ringo is quoted as not thinking Sgt Peppers was their best work.  Well, why not and what was Ringo's favorite?  Mr, Guiliano, you opened the door for us, so why not let us walk through?  On the other hand, there is FAR too much detail on their time with the Maharishi and the general workings of that organization.  Enough already!  I want to read about the Beatles, not some controversial religious figure!  There's also a lot of tawdry details on the love affairs, drug use/abuse, drug busts, and other seedy aspects of their career that are pure tabloid fluff.  Unforgivable beyond all others, there are obvious factual errors everywhere.  I've just finished reading Geoff Emerick's incredibly intriguing book and I can easily tell where Guiliano has either not done proper research or is simply inventing stories that will sound interesting.  There are several contradictions.  Overall, this is written like a collection of articles from People magazine (or whatever they had back then), with no real substance or depth to the content.  I'm sorry I spent the money on it 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught

 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 I was rather disappointed by this book. I was hoping for something which could help explain to business managers why processes such as IT delivery are uncertain, and the value of delivering flexible solutions. The initial part of the book makes a lot of strong qualitative statements of exactly the right sort: - There is great value in breaking up large projects in uncertain markets - Options (flexibility) create value out of uncertain events. - Exit options which allow you to step away from a planned path, even if relatively expensive, may have significant value. - An option such as an exit option, can make an investment viable when it would fail a traditional NPV test.  - Small speculative investments can enable larger investments to benefit from learning and to be much more accurately targeted. - It may create greater value to start many projects and abandon more, rather than aiming to abandon a minimum number.  Unfortunately the remainder of the book then supports these statements only for a very limited set of circumstances. The Real Options approach only seems to work if the option can be translated into (or at least mapped onto) a tradeable financial security. There's no real attempt to provide tools to evaluate internal uncertainty, such as the delivery uncertainty common in IT  projects, or the value of flexibility except where it maps to significant investment decisions.  The book does do a good job of explaining that real world situations are non-linear, with value which changes as a result of natural volatility, over time, and as a result of one or more decisions. Traditional NPV-based approaches greatly undervalue flexibility, insurance, learning and platform investments, and can't really deal with this non-linear aspect. Simply increasing the investment discount rate, which is the usual way of dealing with such problems, doesn't bring the correct focus onto uncertainty and total risk.  However, the mathematical basis for Real Option valuation is not well explained, and I found the processes difficult to follow. I suspect that the authors implicitly assumed a certain familiarity with economic and financial market techniques and terminology, which limits the value of this book to those seeking, as I was, to apply the techniques to other fields. It also left me puzzled as to why simpler approaches, such as Decision Tree techniques, can't be used instead.  Surprisingly for a relatively short book the text is very repetitive, and too often turns into a blatant advert for the Real Options approach compared with others, rather than making the case on its own merits.   Hindsight is a great thing, but it is unfortunate that this book praises Enron as an example of success through options manipulation, where we now know this was largely a "long company" scam. Some of the other examples, quoted at the height of the Internet boom, have also not stood the test of time. However, these should not be seen as invalidating the approach, merely as evidence of how uncertain things may really be.  This book provides some good ideas, and if your focus is major business-critical financial transactions it may be very useful. But I'm still looking for a good book on how to generically value flexibility. 
 I have had this phone for 6 months and it works -but the battery life is not good.  The phones are now to the point that the battery life is very short.  I expected much more with a product made by Motorola.  I tossed my sony wireless for this one and wish I had not.

Due to the fact I have forgotton my password i have been unable to e-mail you about this althoughI have tried on numerous occasions.  I hope someone may be able to hel 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 pyramid scheme n. A fraudulent money-making scheme in which people are recruited to make payments to others above them in a hierarchy while expecting to receive payments from people recruited below them. Eventually the number of new recruits fails to sustain the payment structure, and the scheme collapses with most people losing the money they paid in.  At Charna's school it's pay to play.  Pay to take classes because only people who go through their one year course can play on their stages-then pay coaches if you make a team.  Everybody there makes money off of the show except the players and students at ImprovOlympic.  This is where Truth in Comedy comes in!  If you like constant name dropping you'll love this book!  If you love being bullied in print this text will dazzle you!  If you love being baited into a legit profession yet not take any pay for it (art for art's sake I beleive it's called.  Shhh.  Don't tell Art!) then this tome will tantalize you!  If you're looking to be suckered by one book this year make it Charna Halpern's TRUTH IN COMEDY!  Available in most bookstores 
 I bought this for my cavalier after watching the Petsmart commercial. I understand it is not the same toy, but it bears some resemblence. It came in a dreadful yellow color and was not extremely well made. It was a soft, somewhat cottony/furry texture, not loofah! I couldn't tell you if it is durable, because he hasn't played with it enough to actually rip it.  It contains two squeakers that scare him.  My guess is some dogs would like this toy, the shape is pleasing to dogs, I think my dog just didn't like the texture. I reccommend anything by Fat Cat Inc. in place of this toy 
 Please take my advice and buy another coffee maker!  Made excellent coffee...at the beginning.  Within a couple of months, we started spending many mornings wiping up the entire pot of coffee that brewed and dispensed onto the counter.  Then, the grinder started randomly starting itself and not shutting off.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! 
 I ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available.  The then ask me to review it?  Where is it?  Rev bruce 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 What a letdown. After great selections from L Words CDS 1 and 2, this is a total rip-off, background music and snippets that are versions or close derivatives of the dreaded theme song.  WHAT is the deal with leaving other artists largely behind and hiring Betty as the show's primary music source?  And, oh, ezgirl? is Betty's Elizabeth Ziff.  Not very diversifying, is it?  Save your money -- there's nothing here worth listening to 
 This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions 
 Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful? I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world 
 I am a culinary student in Chicago who has been been using The Professional Chef as my primary textbook for the past 3 months 5 days a week.  This book has multiple errors.  Photographs at times show poor technique.  There's a picture of chicken with beads of sweat which looks like it has been left out too long. Equally as misleading are pictures of fried food which look like they slept in the fry pan. Try making the pumpkin bisque and see how it tastes.   The book does a poor job of explaining technique and the rationale behind cooking ingredients, steps etc.  In short everything you need to know how to cook professionally is poorly laid out. Don't get me wrong I am learning. I get to figure out whats wrong with the recipe after I make it.  I was surprised to read the caliber of endorsements on the jacket as 3/4 of our students have signed a petition to change our textbook.   
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 The book is about how you should prepare to public speech. It talks about how to setup a stage, how to work with a michrophone, how to walk in a stage and the known advices as 'know your audience' and 'rehearse'.  I think this might be good reading if you lack any clue about the process but for people that need to improve their presentation skills it's not worth. Also there's almost nothing on tips for preparing slides (the most common media, I think).  The author keeps giving infinite acronyms where she wants to work on topics (almost all topic groups gets its own) and it's really annoying 
 This is a neat book, but only two stars because of its design. 100 short chapters uncategorized and in no particular order, with no index. There is a table of contents, of course, but the chapters are in no order and the way the chapters are titled they are not easily scanned by the eye, especially across 4-5 pages of listings. It's fun to flip through the book at random for a short while, but it's impossible to refer back to something you found useful at a later date unless you want to turn page by page until you find it. This was really a preventable problem and it's a shame it had to made an otherwise great book frustrating 
 as a longtime fan of loggins and messina i have to admit that this record is the weakest of the lot. by the time this album came out, i am sure loggins and messina were working on diferent agenda's.  this is a tired album, no life and probably fulfilled their committment to columbia records.  i would prefer to think of the energy of loggins and messina on the first two albums of theirs.  don't get me wrong, their are some decent tracks on this album but nothing that rocks like vahevela or country song.

 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 Yes, childhood sexual abuse is a real problem, and those who were victimized in that way need to have the suport to move beyond it. However, "Courage to Heal" and its companion, "Allies in Healing" set about providing that support in entirely the wrong way. If you compare thier suggested approaches to recovery and overcoming the symptoms to the professional psychiatric organizations, there are repeatedly in contradiction to one another. I used to recommend these books and own them both and the workbook too, but after seeing their practices carried out and how they work to actually isolate the potential victim from existing suport networks if hte "recovered" memories are disputed by uninvolved family members, I can't come up with a strong enough warning.   Over the course of my marriage of seven years, my wife has steadily declined in function as her therapist has continuously encouraged her to try to recover her "memories" of childhood abuse and has worked to incresingly isolate her from family and friends concerned about her steady decline and the contradictions present in her memories. Over and over again she has pointed to "expert" sources like Courage to Heal" to dismiss efforts to get her into a form of therapy that is not focused on trying to interpret bad dreams and imagining abuse to convince oneself that sexual abuse really occurred.   It is a myth that someone with emotional troubles has to recovery the memories of why they have difficulty, or that things have to get worse before they get better. The long term psychotherapy and memory recovery methods recommended by the author are actually considered to be harmful when a patient is having a bout of severe depression. The real experts (e.g. the APA) stress that the focus sould be on short term therapeutic methods proven to yeild results in handling one's current life situation and only pursiing long term therapy and working through firm memories when the patient has fully stabilized, and then only if the memories present an ongoing hindrance to a full recovery. If you can become fully functional without recovering any potentially buried memories, there is no reason to seek them out.  Avoid, avoid, avoid. If someone has already recommended these books to you, research for yourself the professional recommended treatment approaches for the symptoms presented (e.g. depression, OCD, etc) and how to evaluate if one's therapy is good or bad 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 I found this book very entertaining and interesting to read. Watts surely excels at presenting his work to as to make it appealing to large non-technical audiences. However, I happen to have a technical background, and while I cannot comment on the sociological value of the results of this new "science of networks," it seems fairly clear that there are no hard results of any significance in this work.  Watts claims to be a mathematician, but all he seems to have done is to construct some simple mathematical models and run computer simulations on these. What's wrong with that, you ask? Well, that is just... how should I put it delicately.. trivial work. No mathematics department would let him get away with a PhD for this... which doesn't really mean anything in and of itself, but this was all the book, written by a self-proclaimed mathematician, has in terms of hard facts or rigorous results. There's a lot of discussion and speculation and interpretation, which is all very interesting, but very little scientifically rigorous original work of any value.   I noticed some other reviewers saying that this is not an easy read, but is worth the effort. I'm not being the least bit snobbish or arrogant about this, but I found the book fairly easy to read (as would anyone with some knowledge of mathematics), and wouldn't advise any laypeople to waste their time. Don't bother following Watts' intellectual travels as a researcher; it may not be easy to read, but there's not much there anyway.  I haven't said much about the actual content about the book, so here goes. Watts identifies the small world phenomenon, aka I can reach the president of the US through at most six steps, as occurring surprising frequently in the world around us. He sets out to understand the why and how of such a phenomenon. Now this is a rather hard problem to answer in a mathematical framework, because such real world networks are very difficult to model.   Watts and his PhD advisor evidently realized this, but went ahead and constructed some very simple models of such networks, and tried to analyze these models. So far so good. But even these simple models proved too hard to analyze mathematically, so they had to resort to running computer simulations, and explain the results in qualitative, rather than quantitative, terms. They made some interesting observations, but frankly, this ain't no work of genius, or anything close. Running simulations when one can't analyze a mathematical model is something all too many graduate students in various engineering disciplines do on a regular basis, but most of them don't have the gift of writing and finding the right audience that Watts does.   In my opinion, these toy models and simulations have nothing deep to say about anything in the real world. Further, in my opinion, this so called new science of networks, which seems to be attracting a fair bit of attention, will have absolutely nothing useful to contribute to any real world problems. In the words of Dennis Miller, that's just my opinion, and of course I could be wrong. But stay tuned, and we'll see 
 Like Tyler's other books, this is yet another batch of smut stories that all sound as if they were written by the same person. Not much imagination going on here. Just repetitive sex with repetitive characters. Dull dull dull. 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 Yes it's true. The book of Sen it`s too much focused on the "theory of social choice" and it never makes an analysis of freedom and rationality by a pure philosophical point of view, but always by the point of view of the "social choice".  And it's also true that this kind of analysis is often related to the impossibility theorem of Arrow, as all the social choice theory could be reducted to that theorem  I think the title of the book does not say the essence of it,  People philosophically intrested in these two concepts should read something else... 
 I like funny rappers who have some talent at least. I do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all. And even the people that I know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they don't like it at all by the third time. Truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke. Avoid this one 
 The book reads like it was written by a high school student.  Ms. Romines lets her arguments lead her to the supporting evidence and not the other was around.  For example, although Laura writes in These Happy Golden Years  that she had never been as happy in her short life as she was the summer  she taught at the Perry School and lived on her parents' claim, Ms. Romines  decides this statement must be false because Laura can see the Wessington  Hills out the window of the school and Wessington contains the letters W,  E, S, and T so really she must be longing to go west the whole time.  The  most infuritating part was when she said that it would have been perfectly  plausible for Laura to write a book about Mary's college years and that her  decision not to might have been indicative of something under the surface.  Anyone who knows these books at all knows that Laura's descriptions are  almost entirely visual and the stories are told through the EYES of the  main character.  Laura's ability to capture the world with words came from  spending years of her life filling in the gaps in Mary's experiences.  How  could she possibly have written a story from the point of vieew of a BLIND  person?  I may not agree with everything I read, but if it is written well  and the arguments are supported well I enjoy learning something anyway.   This book was a lesson in what should not be published 
 The video is geometrically distorted, interlaced, has blown out contrast, almost no detail at all, and horrible sound. TransFlux Films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work, yet including a featurette on the cover designer.  Everyone should avoid this DVD and go for the BFI double feature with L'Age D'Or, which has a watchable Un chein andalou for a change. 
 This book would be really wonderful for kids who are going through a divorce where their daddy is a louse.  The book portrays the father as a deadbeat who doesn't bother to show up for visitations even though he only has them one night a week.  What does this book say that a divorce is?  "A divorce meant that Daddy would not live with Mama, Ruth, and Dinah anymore." I know how impressionable kids are, how is this supposed to be an unbiassed view of divorce?  In my mind this book is designed to taint the mind of impressionable children to make them wonder whether their daddy was going to treat them with the same carelessness as Daddy Bear.  I would warn fathers who find themselves in a divorce to think carefully before allowing their children to read this book 
 Unfortunately this book is not for those of us who need "how to" guidance.  It is full of useless information and opinion, but very little substance.  You are better off searching the web for information 
 This book is written by a Christian layman, and is full of references to God and Jesus throughout the book. In my opinion, working with oneself with regards to any issue, should never be based on any religion of any kind. It should be independent of any religious belief.  The book talks a lot about love as the key to build friendships, like Jesus did. "love and be loved again". His rules to achieve deeper relationships are:  1. Assign top priority to your relationships 2. Cultivate transparency (be open and honest) 3. Dare to talk about your affection 4. Learn the gesture of love 5. Create space in your relationships  The book has a naive and unprofessional approach to the topic. While the author is aware of the fact that too much emotion, care, interest, help, kindness and so on could challenge the relationship, he does not give it much attention, and he even says that too much is better than too little, which is not always true.  It does not provide a way to get closer to the people you care for. There is nothing in this book, which is not already common knowlegde. Everything in the book is basic. It could go as a sweet and funny Christian book about friendships in general. But it is not a professional book about how to go from a regular friendship to a deep and close friendship 
 Democracy, for Sean Wilentz in The Rise of American Democracy, is solely a question of politics. This is, after all, an explicitly political history of the early republic and, in his discussion of how revolutionary Republicanism evolved into a popular, though imperfect, democracy, Wilentz is concerned with democracy in specifically political terms. While this gives the book an admirable focus, he somehow manages, in almost 1000 pages, to tell only part of the story. What Wilentz succeeds in doing is writing a heavy, old-fashioned book driven by an odd teleological sense of American exceptionalism.  Significantly, The Rise of American Democracy is a political history focused almost exclusively on the great political leaders of the early republic. Although Wilentz devotes some time to discussions of popular political movements like the anti-Masonic party and the Workingmen's parties of the eastern port cities, their role is as a catalyst for the emergence of party politics. The political motivations of their leaders and militants are relevant to the extent that they influenced the development of Jacksonian Democracy, but Wilentz is not particularly interested in what democracy meant to the Workie rank-and-file.  This is a particularly odd omission, given the populism of the Jacksonian ideology. Indeed, the Jackson Democrats positioned themselves as the party of the working man and the yeoman farmer, and defined their program in clear opposition to perceived revenant Federalist commercial aristocracy, particularly in regards to the Second Bank of the United States and trade policy. The economic crises of 1819 and 1837 are political issues, ushering in, respectively, an "Era of Bad Feelings" and the decline of Federalism, and a crisis in Jacksonian Democracy and the rise of the Whig opposition. What these crises meant in social terms to the working people and farmers in social and cultural terms, Wilentz doesn't say.  To be fair, that's mostly because he is interested in American democracy in political, and not economic terms, and from a national perspective. Social issues and local, class-based agitation, while significant as an influence on Jacksonian ideology and strategy, is a small part of his story. The central tension in The Rise of American Democracy has to do with balancing local and sectional interests and grievances with an emergent democratic nationalism. Consequently, the central drama in this section of the book revolves around the conflict between Andrew Jackson, and his national vision, and John C. Calhoun's evolving sectionalism.  Not surprisingly, Jackson is the towering figure in this section of Wilentz's book, and it is in his presidency that the author locates both the democratization of the American republic and the source of most of the political currents and issues that would define American politics throughout the 19th century. Indeed, Wilentz does nothing to conceal his sympathies and admiration for Jackson. He is inclined to forgive Jackson's Indian policies as being motivated, essentially, by good intentions, and he mostly ignores the fact that he was a slave owner and a defender of slavery. While dismissing earlier historians' contentions that the Jackson's policies were inconsistent and that he "trapped himself in some large contradictions," Wilentz argues that the president pursued a consistent, though not always successful program of nation-building: "In fact, Jackson, drawing on long-established beliefs, carved out a coherent and principled democratic nationalism on basic constitutional issues." (382)  For Wilentz, by the 1830s, democracy was "ascendant," and even the most aristocratic Federalists had begun to see it as a necessary evil. Universal white male suffrage was almost universal - with the notable exception of Virginia - and there was a general agreement that government was a manifestation of popular sovereignty. The sticky issue in the dispute between Calhoun and Jackson was whether that sovereignty was manifested by the state or the nation as a whole. Significantly, though Jackson successfully quashed the nullification crisis and the state interests were accommodated to national interests through measures like the Missouri Compromise, it was a tenuous modus vivendi at best.  Indeed, the politics of the early republic were very much a question of imperfectly accommodating southern sectionalism within emerging national parties. Both the Democrats and the Whigs sought to bridge sectional differences while seeking broad popular support for increasingly divergent political programs. The failure of the Jacksonian Democrats, in fact, to maintain themselves as "the party of popular sovereignty" (515) against the rise of a trans-sectional Whiggism was very much an inability to understand how complex ideas of popular sovereignty had become.  The Rise of American Democracy is very much a history of the minute details of American politics in the period, from the Eaton affair to the shifting and evolving political philosophies of Jackson, Calhoun, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. The problem is that the book is so concerned with the details that Wilentz sometimes loses the bigger picture. For example, slavery and its expansion is a significant issue throughout the period, and Wilentz devotes a considerable about of space to abolitionist agitation and the tensions the issue produced in national politics. But though he connects the political issue of slavery to the political issue of states' rights and the fortunes of the nascent political parties, he fails to situate it as a significant social issue with deep contradictions with American democracy.  Ultimately, this is a "great" book only in the sense of its physical heft 
 I really didn`t think the photographs in this book were all that good. Some fine but oh so many poor. Many seem taken through a dirty glass so are blurred. Certainly a lot of photographs but it would have been better to have narrowed down by over hal 
 We bought this model because it had the different grind capabilities. It quit working after 1 year. We also bought one for my mom and her's quit much sooner. :- 
 My Lord John - a real disappointment - the book is so steeped in geneological detail on almost every page that it is almost incomprehensible - the main thrust of the story is lost, and the characters become confusing and uninteresting.  Definitely not one of the best of Heyer's work. The book is also unfinished, ending in the moddle of a sentence!  I would NOT recommend this book 
 If you are looking to pass time with an author who is gifted in communicating strong emotions, you found your book. If you are hoping to learn about corporate bait and switch or getting a job, this book is void of that.   The book jacket and introduction tells readers the author sets out to get a job, work in corporate America and then write a book about her presumed challenges. Barbara Ehrenreich admits she lied (p.9) to employers about her job history and got friends, with similar values, to support her lies. It didn't work. She never got a job and wrote a book about it anyway. The content basically is a five-page article that Barbara Ehrenreich sold as a 237 page book that is slow paced. Monotonous details are ubiquitous (e.g. itemizing the food in buffet lines and what strangers put on their lunch plates).   If you are discouraged about your job search, don't get this book. It will not lift you up, it will not help you get a job and it has serious potential to put you in a depressing downward spiral. Barbara Ehrenreich is unbalanced against capitalism and corporate America. While it is well known they are not perfect, Barbara Ehrenreich never mentions the positive aspects of capitalism and corporate America. Nor does she give comparative statistics on the amount of people who live well in capitalist economies verses other economies. The book is a constant flow of vocational pessimism.  Although the author uses the first half of the book to set herself up as a well-reasoned, balanced and unprejudiced person, one does sense there is a some bias to her writing. Not until page 139 does Barbara Ehrenreich reveal she is an atheist. Thus, one would think she would avoid churches. Yet she unashamedly goes to churches hoping to secure a job while lying about her background. She then grumbles that she wasted her time there. She mercilessly mocks common church-going people and those who don't accept her anticapitalist views. It is hard to imagine Ehrenreich walked into the church meetings without prejudice.   While it is true that bait and switch is going on in numerous HR departments, this book has nothing about that 
 Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.   There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.   There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.   Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  PROS:  Can be used for film or digital cameras  Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting   CONS:  Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance 
 This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it 
 I could attack this book for its lack of political merit, but that would just come off as a rant. What rather incites this negative review is that the book is just so poorly written. The text is laced with opinion statements masked as fact (for example, the semantic debate over what constitutes a "conservative;" this argument, which is one of the cover issues of the book, is bizarre on its own because it takes the late-18th century definition of liberal and stacks it up against the 20th century definition of conservative, but again, neither here nor there).  Every sentence is very simple, there are no words that are too big, so as not to confuse every South Park conservative who gets lost between the Dan Browns, the Steve Kings, and the 2-for-$11 DVD sections at the bookstores. The book is brimming with needless erreta and digressions, distractions, not to mention a fair number of grammatical errors, ironic (or appropo?) given the book's harsh condemnation of the American intellectual; in a book where every professor is a communist and every college graduate is a tree-hugger, it's not terribly surprising to find so much passive voice, subject-object confusion, confused pronouns, and uncited "data."  Certainly a fine bookshelf filler for every budding, young neoconservative. But if you're interested in buying a book that you'll be able to get all the way through without chuckling to yourself and muttering, "and this is presented as a HISTORY book?" you may wish to look elsewhere 
 Heinlein's first attempt at a novel stayed locked away, unpublished, in a drawer until after his death for a reason.  As a story, the plot does not flow and the characters, although very smart, lack any real depth.  This was Heinlein's extended diatribe on how he thought the world should be.  Heinlein is probably lucky that this book was not picked up by a publisher.  In the fifties, he would have went to jail for writing such ideas. This book is great as a comparison read to see how much Heinlein changed from his idealistic youth until his libertarian death.  Some of the predictions are true, but, at this time, Heinlein really underestimated how much technological development would come in the near future.    I recommend this book to Heinlein fans as a comparison or beginnings work.  I would also recommend this book to economics students as they would be the only ones to truly grasp the economic scenario laid out towards the end.  It could have been more.  I think Heinlein recycled what he thought he could use in other stories.  If you want to read some Heinlein, there are other better selections to choose from.   
 I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker.  I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it.  It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information.  If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book.  If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else 
 I've seen a great deal of these films and consider myself a buff. This selection is very weak! Most of the films are of the film strip variety, where there's music and there are still images that change, rather than the piece being a movie. Some of the films are unpardonably boring! There's so much great stuff out there, but not on this DVD. If you must see it, rent it 
 I think that people who buy this book should know that many of the recipes require the use of a cake mix.  It may be that when I actually make the cakes, I will regret what I write now, but until then I am feeling a little short changed.  Surely Mrs. Pregnall does not use commercial cake mix in her own shop 
 Does Deniro even appear in this movie?  Talk about false advertising.  
 I find it difficult to believe that someone who endorses 9-11 conspiracy theories (see the authors review of "9-11 Mysteries" on December 7th)  could be viewed as an authority on intelligence issues.  If he ever had any credibility in the field, he's long since gone over the deep end.  Ironically, its people like him and his ilk, who believe a neconservative/Israeli conspiracy was behind the destruction of the twin towers, that best undermine the central premise of his book:  that ordinary citizens need to take a greater role in intelligence.  If 9-11 conspiracy theories are the sort of  mind-numbingly stupid, paranoid output that can be expected from the sort of amatuer intelligence agents Steele wishes for, I'd prefer to leave it to professionals 
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end 
 This movie makes an attempt at showing a the plight of illegal immigrants but when you watch it you are only shown a glimpse of the trouble they cause. They cross through ranches, leaving litter, killing animals, provoking ranchers, causing crime and when they have trouble out there the US Taxpayer is expected to foot the bill. I get that these people are trying to find work (not in all instances) but you can't be overly sympathetic because they have a rotten deal - you have to respect the rights of US citizens. If this movie was going to be fair - they would have show a rancher and his family - show the fear, show the costs!! 
 This CD is the book being read by a text to speach piece of software. It is totally unacceptable & far too difficult to listen to 
 Poorly made and weak. Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder. Stopped using it within a day after purchase. There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market. Avoid this one 
 I bought this book because of all of the good reviews. I was NOT impressed. First of all, the writing is mediocre at best. The stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes. The first three stories I read were about anal sex, watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on. To be honest these stories turned me OFF and I'll be returning the book. Save your money this is not good 
 I really don't know how to write a "helpful" review for this camera, I'm not a photographer; all I can say is that I was NOT satisfied with my purchase, so...  *** If you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like I was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras. ***  Here are my complaints:  Flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.  Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.  The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background. Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).  The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.  Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!  Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier. The video mode is great as well.  If you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then I must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time 
 Anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine, as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed, are often given bad reviews.  Its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist, weak-willed mainstream American.  The worst part of Rolling Stone is the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All time list; as they highly rate Kirk Hammett, Kurt Cobain, and Tom Morello (all extremely overrated guitarists) while rating Eddie Van Halen at a very lowly #70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists; Kerry King/Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), John Petrucci (Dream Theater), Trey Azagthoth/Erik Rutan (Morbid Angel), Jeff Loomis (Nevermore), Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani.  If you know anything about good guitarists, those eight guitarists I just mentioned DESTROY Kirk, Kurt, and Tom.  Don't read this if you're trying to decide what good music is, YOU decide what good music is.  Think for yourself, don't let MTV and Rolling Stone think for you 
 I bought this for my husband at Christmas because we like to stargaze (casually) and wanted something with basic instruction.  This book is for somebody who is serious about astronomy - not a casual binocular stargazer.  
 This is the most god awful method for learning a language I have ever encountered. My jaw dropped when I saw that NASA and other government agencies were using this software in order to learn a foreign language. If that is truly the case then I demand my tax dollars back. It is THAT bad. The reason I gave this software a shot is because their marketing campaign has been asserting that it was the absolute definitive method for learning a new language. You're probably looking at it for the same reason.  First, you should know that you can purchase a set of flash cards from your local bookstore and it is just as effective as any rosetta stone softare and costs 90% less.  I used this software when I borrowed it from a friend in order to see if it was better than my current method of learning mandarin, which I'll get into later. I had an opportunity to make copies of this software when it was in my possession but decided against it. Not out of fear of piracy penalties, just plain because I would rather not have this software than have a copy of it. That's really how awful it is.  Imagine if your parents tried to teach you English by only teaching you noun/picture association? It wouldn't work unless you learned about proper English grammar and proper syntax. If you learned about verbs and other things. This program will assume you know all your Chinese numbers automatically. In the very beginning a picture of a little girl will show up and it will verbally say 'one little girl' in mandarin... however it will not tell you which word means the number one, which word means girl, and so on. It's a guessing game, not a learning experience.  All the positive reviews I've seen for any Rosetta stone software on amazing seem absolutely phony and fabricated to me (especially on the Rosetta Stone Japanese page). Please beware, and there is no better way to prove that what I'm saying is true other than trying a demo for yourself. I am sure that it is as bad as the full retail version that I used for a week.  The absolute best method I've used for learning mandarin has been pimsleur's audio cds. (I've never tried berlitz and pimsleur's other competitors, but I'm sure they are better than Rosetta stone). I have used Mandarin I and II so far from pimsleur, and I am able to hold impressive conversations with other fluent speakers of mandarin. The great thing about it is that pimsleur explains everything to you, allows you to say it out loud, there is no brute memorization involved with pimsleur, only natural language assimilation.  Just ask yourself this, when you learned English as a child. Did you learn    by learning how to read and write first? Or did you learn how to speak and listen first? Didn't you learn syntax first and then use what you learned to formulate your own sentences? That's exactly how pimsleur has taught me mandarin. I was surprised how I was able to create my own grammatically correct sentences with pimsleur only a few lessons in.  Go ahead and try a demo of any Rosetta stone language. It should be enough to keep you away from Rosetta stone in favor of any of their competitors. I've heard good things about berlitz and others, but pimsleur in my opinion is the absolute best. 
 This book is pure nonsense.  I found it in our public library, a two-volume set from 1904.  It consists of poorly-written hearsay masquerading as scholarship 
 I purchased this CD shortly after finding out that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band.  I hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children.  This CD honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years.  Although, I guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD.  You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD.  I don't believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet.  This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to say that this purchase was a let down overall 
 I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users.  
 I was disappointed that almost all the photos were of Mormons in Utah or Arizona - This book seems to ignore the many other non-Mormon pioneers and history.  
 I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire.  Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.  The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths.  Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality.  This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.    Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel.  Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about.  The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting.  Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before.  It's a truly frustrating experience 
 I was appalled at the lack of editing, the poor grammar and the number of typos in this book.  Perhaps others could overlook it.  I was constantly distracted and therefore found it difficult to muster any respect for the author.  In addition, I felt that it was written for a rather uneducated audience, for folks who couldn't analyze and think for themselves.  The conversations of the characters were overstated.  In general, the concept of the book was ok, not spectacular, but the format was undigestible 
 "Sins and Needles" reflects the current state of our American society:  it's okay to go bad, be bad, turn it all around and go on to make money from it.  There are many folks who have lived a normal life without all the theatrics achieved by Raymond and Melanie Materson in this pitiful little book. (It's okay, because he was using a toy gun to rob and TERRORIZE someone.) There is nothing in this book that enlightens, educates or garners enthusiasm from anyone who has throughout life worked hard to be a good citizen, good spouse, good parent and good person.  It is hard to believe this book was published.  It is not well written and so elementary I was able to read it cover to cover in less than an hour. The book becomes particularly horrible at the end when the Matersons give the impression their romance and connection is so special.  It appears like she was wanting to find someone who could make money and she was the perfect manipulator who got him to take her out of her unhappy life since she was already married with a child when she met and married Materson in prison.  These two were perfect for one another!  Their former lives filled with lies and deceit followed by their present life goal of "let's see how much money we can make from our criminal activities" show they are taking advantage of others one way or the other.  This book is a lesson on how NOT to live your life because not everyone is so taken in by such a selfish existence. The Matersons have used one another for so long it would be surprising if they stay together long enough to write any more books.  Thank goodness for that 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I noticed there were not many new items in this game, I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving.  This expansion ws not worth the money 
 Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.  Us Weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses.  I'm not buying their story or the magazine again 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 This product performs poorly. Within 1 month of receiving it, water no longer flowed through the coffee. After complaining to Krups, sending it for repairs and finally getting a replacement, I am still not very happy with it. The frothing part is unpredictable in its creation of quality foam. Krups did better with their older model of this machine 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 This is a stylish toaster.  Have you tried finding a decent toaster lately?  I've been through many.  If you like crispy dark toast, this is it - but if you like browned toast, this is uneven and burns one end, and light on the other.  This is the second one of these I had.  The first was bad and so the customer service (which is very good) sent me a replacement.  It's just as bad.  Used to be any cheapo toaster would do a great job.  It's much harder to find one now.  If you look inside when the elements are going, many of the windings of the heating elements are too tight and so don't heat up since they are flush against the insulation so only around 1/2 of the inner elements even glow red, but the outer ones are better, so it's very uneven.  Good luck 
 I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either.  The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions.  Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.  Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous.  I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this 
 Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest.  This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.  This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the "cherished myths debunked" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.  Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as "peacenik", "peace offensive", and "red diaper baby."  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.  Strange...  Hey, some books should best be left to the pros.  Simple as that 
 Although the maps were helpful, much of this book seemed outdated.  Addresses were wrong, business gone and reviews questionable 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 This book is one of the worst that I've ever read in life. It doesn't have any person that you want to learn more about, in fact, by the end of this novel, you'll be glad Beckett finally shut-up. The novel seems to be writen in some horrible attempt at poetry at points and lacks a plot. In fact, it is not until near the end of the novel do we learn anything about the storyline. For a book that seemed to gain praise from many, it makes me sad that the trees, that were used to make this book died in vien. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. I'm just glad I only paid a doller for it 
 I was a little disappointed. There were a few tidbits that I liked but other than that, nothing I didn't know. Kind of a "preaching to the choir" kind of book in my opinion. 
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 I'm a huge Dean Koontz fan, and I have read almost all of his fifty plus novels.  SHADOWFIRES is mildly entertaining, but it really isn't one of Koontz's strongest efforts.  This novel was written in the mid-1980s under the Leigh Nichols pseudonym, and I thought it was the weakest book under that name.  SHADOWFIRES is essentially a long chase story, with a man/woman team on the run from a lot of sinister forces unleashed by a genetic experiment gone wrong.  Koontz has explored this territory before in superior novels such as WATCHERS and MR. MURDER.  If you're new to Koontz, my advice is to read those novels instead of this one.    In the end, SHADOWFIRES is a bit too long and drawn out, and I think Koontz put too many characters in this book.  I also found the two main characters to be kind of boring and cookie-cutter.  Koontz also spends too much time on description and exposition in this book; I found myself skipping through paragraphs to reach the end.  This is actually a pretty decent book, but I give it two stars when comparing it to other great novels in Koontz's canon.  Try those instead -- WATCHERS, INTENSITY, LIGHTNING, FEAR NOTHING, and ODD THOMAS are the ones that most people consider the best.  
 I'm sorry, but this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.  I purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be. In reality, it's nearly everything that's WRONG with low-budget films.   First off, the camera work is horrible. Secondly, I've seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays. I mean, these actors make Keanu Reeves look like Denzel Washington. And finally, the story was absolutely horribly done. I admit, the premise itself had some promise--But the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor I might have had.  Plain and simply, this film was unwatchable. I turned it off 65% through it. And I would've turned it off earlier but I was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen.  If you care at all about quality, in any sense, DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PIECE OF TRASH 
 This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one! 
 I refuse to believe that any human being can actually believe the hateful, uninformed, and often bewildering things that Ann Coulter says in this book. So if you're thinking about buying "Godless" or any other of Ann's hate speech because you're a conservative and want to read more about conservative beliefs, keep looking. Turning to this drivel to learn more about true conservatism is like trying to become an attorney by watching a Judge Judy marathon. It's entertainment for the lowest common denominator. Ann Coulter sells books by being outrageous and spewing craziness so you'll be interested. She doesn't care about conservatives, and she doesn't share your beliefs - I don't care who you are. All she cares about is taking your money. Do us all a favor and stop padding this woman's pockets. 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 I haven't read this book.  I won't read this book. I don't need to read this book.  Here someone has the audacity to compare the Harry Potter books with Tolkien's huge achievement; anyone who would think there is anything worth comparing is dull-witted.  This has been written to make $. Ignore it, good people 
 This book is deeply flawed. It foundational premise is utter nonsense. Tarnas has used his vast understanding of the humanties and history and attempted to correlate trends, themes, biographies and events to the movement of planets.   Like all astrologers, he is attempting to merge the scientific and factual using his intuition, seeing corrlations and causes and effects when none exist. The intuitive connection between the scientfic facts and the "facts" of history simply does not work. The supposed correlations  are simply subjective conjecture. And in the final analysis, the over arching question is "so what?".  I found the book very disappointing in light of his brilliant Passion of the Western mind 
 I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable and because they looked like they were made of leather. They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not attractive.  They will be returned.    
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her! 
 Don't let this review get you down on the band. There is surely some good music here. But only on the opening of this CD. After that, its downhill. Nothing Horrible. Just not mentionable. Buy Yoshime if you want a Great CD. The newer Mystics is good, Soft B. should be a pickup (not the first one). Simple. Buy Yoshime. Its there best effort hands down. The others will follow. This one will not be played, unless you burn and take the first track off it. 
 I did not receive the book!  For some unknown reason, it was returned to you.  At this point I DO NOT WANT IT 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 All homeschool books that are hardcore Christian need a warning label - right on the front cover and probably on every page too.    Meaningful church involvement is a necessary ingredient for homeschool success?  I have to have a biblical conviction that God has called me to homeschool?    I guess I have to forget about homeschooling then, since neither of those apply to me.  Then she gets into curriculum and tells you to save yourself some time and settle on a traditional curriculum (if I wanted a traditional curriculum I might as well leave my kid in public school) designed for Christian or public school use.  That's great if you want a traditional curriculum.  But there are FAR more curricula out there than the Christian and traditional curricula she suggests.  And a great many kids have been successfully homeschooled using other than the "traditional" method.  Seems like she could at least have mentioned that fact.  On the last page I read before I could read no more, (which was about a third of the way in), she notes that instead of attempting to meet any state-mandated objectives, one should strive to realize God-given directives.  However let me warn you - if your state requires certain criteria such as standardized testing that you fail to do since it was not a divine directive, be sure to get a lawyer because the state will take you to court.  If she had only titled this book The Ultimate Guide to Christian Homeschooling, I think it would have been great.  All of us non-Christians would have avoided it and Christian homeschoolers would probably get a lot out of it.  There is a tremendous amount of information in it that is of value - if you approach it from a hardcore Christian point of view.  But if you DO NOT believe (as I DO NOT) that children are in desperate need of training if they are to grow up to bow their knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then give this book a pass 
 I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat.  This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.  Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good.  
 What kind of rapist gets to be a hero in another book? When I first started reading this book I wasn't very impressed to begin with.  I have read some of Catherine Coulter's other books and found them very enjoyable.  Imagine my surprise and disgust when after I read that horrible rape scene I turn to the back of the book and-viola!- the VILIAN has his own romance staring HIM as the hero??? Just knowing this made me unable to finish the book.  I realize that the plot is set hundreds of years ago and although this might have happened then I certainly don't want it happening in my reading.  What ever happened to the hero having integrity? Honor? Courage?  Did the author hope to make this look like a "nice" rape?  It ruined the entire book for me and I doubt I will be reading the other books in this series 
 The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play.   Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Thought I was sending our youngest son a birthday present.....turns out this version was not the one my husband and I listened to in the car but an abbreviated version that requires a special CD that he does not have in his car 
 (Yup...it's that DC hating teen on her dad's account)  Although GG is possibly one my favorite television series, I was disappointed with this one.   Possibly NO character development, except maybe Lorelai.   Jared Padalecki's annoyingly routine guest spots as married/in-denial/sleazball chump cheater Dean Forrester gets on my last nerve. I could smack Rory for sleeping with him, and ruining his fated marriage.  Meanwhile, Lorelai becomes almost ditzy. Her relationship with Jason Stiles gets quite boring. She's totally oblivious to Luke's obvious infatuation with her.   Emily and Richard's seperation is the best part...watching them bicker is funny.  The end kiss with Luke/Lorelai is the best part.  Otherwise...don't get it 
 This book just didn't really say that much. I don't know how else to put it. I guess that means that my review won't really say much. :-) It feels like it was written as an executive summary for executives who want to know the buzzwords and acronyms so they can sound like they know what Digital Asset Management is. It was really odd when the author went into a little bit of detail about the technology, of course it didn't really say anything, but it was just enough to make one sound like an idiot 
 Usually the "Grammy Nominees" series produces a compilation in which, understandably, some pieces are way below the others in quality. The 2001 edition suffers more than ever of this syndrome. In fact, quality is truly hard to find on this CD. Under the label of "pop" several unworthy songs somehow find their way into the selections. Hard to understand why, but the few decent tracks merely manage to assert that some effort was actually put into the decision. The variety of genres that appear merely confuse me about what exactly is the purpose of this CD, rather than provide a large field from which to find something that I like. The fact is, it is so broad that a fan of a particular style of music will  be left utterly disappointed. 1)"Say my name" - a normally catchy song that seems out of place on this album. 2)"I try" - decent effort by Macy Gray, but she does not deserve to win a Grammy. 3)"Music" - Madonna's new song is nothing above average. 4)"Bye bye bye" - Usually annoying 'Nsync produce a better to digest single, but no reason to incorporate on this CD. 5)"Beautiful day" - U2's magnificent song, one of the best of the year, is one of the high points on the album. 6)"Sexx laws" - mildly agreeable Beck single similar to most of his work. 7)"The Real Slim Shady" - overplayed Eminem single is great, but no reason to buy this CD; buy his album instead. 8)"Optimistic" - extremely disappointing song from Radiohead; a definite weak point. 9)"You're the one" - Paul Simon's new track is enjoyable at most, but marks musical talent at its best. 10)"Cousin Dupree" - moderately bouncy music by Steely Dan does not justify their win. 11)"What a girl wants" - it is simply shameful to include such kind of bubble gum pop on a respectable compilation 12)"Save me" - very docile and slightly unnerving song from a new artist; decidedly bad choice. 13)"Both sides now" - another uninspired pick; nondescript in every way. 14)"Oops!I did it again!" - Britney is OK, but if she deserved a place at the Grammys, it would have to be for her prevoius album. 15)" Show me the meaning..." - almost disturbing Backstreet Boys have no place in the same room with a Grammy; a ghastly song, truly repulsive. 16)"Pinch me" - the best and the brightest on this album; Barenaked Ladies truly underrated as a band, always producing high quality music. 17)"Breathless" - The Corrs are nothing spectacular, but still bearable. To make a long story short, this album is only for collectors 
 To attach this to your fridge, you have to attach the magnets to the back of the board. Unfortunately, the magnets stick very poorly, and after 10 or 20 minutes, the board falls down, leaving the magnets behind. I tried pressing them down overnight, but that didn't help. Now have to go find some epoxy to stick them on.  Update: after gluing them to the back, it has worked well. The eraser on the pen is a bit flimsy and I don't expect it to last, but there's always paper towels 
 But the author's personal attack on a reader made sure I will never buy it. If you place yourself or your work in the court of public opinion, don't be so naive to think that everyone will applaud your efforts. I was appalled at this lack of professionalism from the author. Live and let live - not everyone will like your book. Sheesh! "Brand of stupidity" - That's a little harsh, and for something you chose to comment on a year later. Too bad you can't erase your comment; you're loosing readers because of something you did on impulse (or maybe it did actually take you 10 months to come up with that) :-O 
 Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this 
 The best way I can describe these guys are 50 cent lyrics without Dre's beats.  All these guys talk about is going to the club, sex, and guns.  Their flow isn't anything special and the songs are extremely repetitive.  The majority of their beats are low off key minor notes with some handclapping mixed in.  One of their more popular songs is "stomp and clap."  They stomp and clap 50 times and shout out to ATL, the west coast, and new york... Wow, that's a good one guys.  I'm stomping this cd out of my collection and I suggest everyone avoids this cd as well 
 I like Bose products.  I also think they are a good company, overall.  But these phones are simply mediocre in sonics.  Put them on, and they sound good enough.  But, they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness.  They do not compare to $25 Philips SHE9500s sonically.  The Philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on (of course, the same goes for the Bose--it is ESSENTIAL to "find the bud for you," or you'll never see the merits to in-ear phones).  If you don't think that finding the right sized bud is important, try (carefully) using in-ears WITHOUT any buds on and you'll get tinny nothingness.  You can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system.  NO COMPARISON, the Philips are truly PREMIUM at c.$25 against the near $100 you serve up for the Bose.  Again, these phones are GOOD.  At $25 they'd be a fair value--even so at just under $50;  still, they would not be as good as the Philips SHE9500s.  At nearly $100, the Bose are overpriced and, in my opinion, you are paying for all the TV advertising they do.  If you have money to burn, you can't go TOO wrong with the Bose--but you CAN do better.  TWO STARS because they do work.  But since I now have five pairs of Philips SHE9500s, I doubt I will ever use the Bose again.  They are not a value.  For that, look to the Philips SHE9500s 
 I am disgusted that you would even think to ask me what my thoughts are. I emailed you with a complaint that the copy I bought was listed as new. I complained that the page edges gave the appearance they had been torn using a ruler rather than guillatined. I was very disapointed with the book and even moreso that you failed to reply to my email - I have bought a few books fom you and intended to buy more but your professionalism is so lacking that I think from now on I'll shop elsewhere.

 This book is full of the author's entertaining video-shooting experiences, told in an entertaining style. It contains almost nothing of what the title and commercial blurbs suggest it contains. If you are (like me) an amateur video maker looking for tips on creating a higher-quality product while living off your day job,look elsewhere. His definition of "no-budget" includes having to rent an old helicopter, rather than a new one, for an aerial shot. The text is full of unexplained technical and slang references to filters, lights, and other equipment but it doesn't matter that you don't understand them because if you're really no-budget you can't afford them anyway. There are a few real gems, like the opening chapter on the history of various video technologies, but these just emphasize the point -- buy this book if you want to be entertained, not if you want to learn anything practical 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 In response to Trevor from MN.   Shame on you.  Does your momma know you talk like that?  You're a wicked young man who is listening to a wicked woman who uses filthy language and calls it art.  You and this Lil Kim will burn in hell together. And such a hypocrite you are putting down people who like popular music.  Didn't you call Ashlee Simpson's album "THE MOST AWESOME ALBUM EVER" in one of your reviews.  I suppose your excuse for that is that you were high on drugs.  Well mister, I'd believe that 
 I found one of the most depressing albums of all time, and it was under my nose. There's only one real saving grace off this album, and that was "Shine On You Crazy Diamond(Part One)" It was a rather dark, stark, and yet beautiful piece, but I can't say that for the second part of the song which you have to endure through 3 horrible songs just to get to. "Welcome To The Machine" is boring as well as depressing it seems like it's never ending like "Tuesday Afternoon" "Have A Cigar" is also long-winded, and depressing, "Wish You Were Here" it's not the greatest, but it's also not that bad either. I also realized that there was some conflict going on with the group, and Capitol Records after "Dark Side Of The Moon" wound up being so successful, and made the group move over to Columbia Records, and a perchance meeting with former frontman Syd Barrett during the recording of this album was also noted. He was only 29 when he saw them again, and it looked like he aged 35 years by then. Which is the same spirit I got when I heard this album all the way through on December 18, 1993. It was a boring Saturday night in Florida, and I had nothing to do with myself except to put my brother's Floyd cd collection onto cassette tapes. I don't wish to be there again. 
 Package arrived in good condition, however.....i spent alot of money on this item .......is very small for what you get and then the ac adaptor doesn't even come with it!! These toys are getting more expensive and then don't include any accessories for what you pay for. I like yamaha products but would be very careful in future to buy items like these from online. 
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
   I quote from the introduction to the book: "The stories that appear in this book are those of individual people and, in one case, a composite of several..." Since when does a researcher combine individual stories to create a 'composite of several'? This important sentence questions the accuracy and validity of the stories in this book.  Why won't the author tell us which stories she considers 'individual' and which one is the 'composite'. What if the composite story is the one that is emphasized, the one that the author keeps going back to?  The book is a worthwhile read for someone like me, who lives in the hasidic community, and who is wondering whether others, too, are unhappy with so many restriction. The good thing about this book is that it mentions (if you read the notes in tiny print in the back) the existence of an organization that caters to people who are trying to leave the hasidic way of life. That organization might indeed serve an important purpose, if it is being done correctly. Young hasidic boys whose English and academic skills are poor need outside assistance and support if they want to be able to choose their own way of life.  But I would not believe the details in each story until the author clarifies. I would not suggest this as a worthwhile read for someone trying to learn about hasidim from the outside. It is too negative. Try watching 'A Life Apart'. I found the atmosphere and mood of that movie to be quite charming. It is a good starting point. There are other books out there that I have not read that cover the hasidic way of life from different viewpoints. Don't let this be the only book you read!  To read the section of the author's introduction that I referred to, simply place your mouse on the image of the book and a search box will pop up. Type in 'composite of several' and read the page that comes up.   As I read in a previous review, the author should publish her final dissertation, if it exists, the one that prompted all this research, so that we can get an accurate portrayal of these hidden lives and of how the data was collected. 
 THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD, SO I BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU LIKE RAP YOU'LL LIKE THIS CD, BUT IF YOU HATE IT, DON'T BOTHER 
 I'd just like to know, what are the people smoking that think this toy is realistic?  I'll admit, I've gotten tons of fun from it... becuase it's just so odd. The noises are weird and the movements are oh-so-70s- mechanical-robot.   Go buy your kid a book. 
 I was thrilled at the sound of this book and expected it to be filled with succint wisdom -- the type of wisdom you receive from friends' emails, save to a file or print, and never organize into a book.  However, it was really several longer narrations of the author's opinion on selected topics.  All in all, I found it to be of little value and quickly relegated it to my attic collection 
 Lord, what did the Publisher do?  Type the poems on 3x5 cards, shuffle  them and present the totally random result?  The poems follow no order at  all.  Early is mixed with late; India with the sea with World War I.  The  book cries out for an editor, an annotator, anyone!  The publisher should  be ashamed 
 I have numerous KA appliances, including the stand mixer and Food Processor.  I was happy to see a nice salad spinner, but was disappointed when I opened to use it for the first time.  The middle plunger which you are to turn counter clockwise to remove will not budge!  I tried, my husband tried and it is impossible to remove, therefore, I am unable to use the store feature since I cannot remove the plunger.  Something as simple as a salad spinner should not be so complicated 
 The classic easy-to-use and pantry-friendly Better Homes and Garden Cookbook is pretty much in every kitchen in America and chances are, it's already in yours too.  If so, then then there's nothing in this obnoxiously-colored cookbook for kids that you couldn't find in either the adult BH & H cookbook or a back issue of Family Circle.  With a few exceptions, (most notably the breakfast pizza and the Hula Stir Fry) it's all extremly standard fare.  The only thing that sets it apart is the crazy fonts and colors so obnoxious that I had to wait ten minutes between reading it and writing this review so I could see straight again.  I mean, are you really in need of another chicken nugget recipe?  Isn't there anything more interesting they could come up with?  And it isn't written to make the cooking any easier for kids--they might as well grab your adult copy and save their vision.  If you're looking for a kid's cookbook that's full of good projects that will appeal to your children, I recommend the Everything Kid's Cookbook which has a black on white format, crossword puzzles and word finds for the older kids, and easy to follow instructions along with five really terrific projects that the kids can whip up for play, like bubbles and play dough.  Mom and Me by Annabel Karmel is also a much, much better selection, with easy to follow illustrated directions.  This is a suped-up version of standard fare you'd be better off skipping 
 I totally agree with Barry Smith. This book spends more space describing the author's personal use of Lightroom than explaining how to use it. I found  the User Guide both easier to read and more useful than Evening's book. One of the least useful books in the digital imaging field that I have read 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 I tried to stay with this book to the end, but alas, I tossed it with only about 20 pages left.  By this time the plot had become so byzantine that I no longer cared who did what.  Furthermore, I was getting pretty sick and tired of the sophomoric and unrealistically  silly dialog that ran all through the book.  The relationship between Moon and the FBI lady, for instance, was like something out of a novel for teenagers.  In other words, the book lacked credibility.  Doss falls short, I'm afraid, of even a mediocre Hillerman book. Hillerman weaves in the rich and mystical lore of the Indian culture quite effectively.  His dialog is pitch perfect, not contrived, as in this book.   And, as another reviewer noted, I was put off by Doss's maddening habit of witholding clues and information through the book.  I was looking forward to a good read, but all in all, it turned out to be a very flawed book 
 I wanted to like this book, but I guess I'm not down and depressed enough to relate to it. It was just so much of the same miserable life page after page after page.  Oh wait-- there's good reason: she was never hugged as a child, therefore can and will be a depressed alcoholic loser for her entire life.  I don't mind some "loser-lit" but there has to be an evolution or an awakening or some kind of lightbulb to keep me interested, otherwise I lose sympathy and figure, well, if that's your attitude, you deserve what you get.  I can relate to the "hard times-hard life" theme-- everyone's faced some dark moments-- but I can't feel much empathy when it becomes a choice, a lifestyle, an escape, and just a jerky way of behaving.  Normally I'd give this a higher rating because the "writing" was  more or less technically correct, but I, for one, am getting tired of "I Suck" books that ramble on without a point, without a story, without any real skill in creative storytelling.   I did not find "a character who is endearing because of her flaws."  She was a jerk.  I didn't think they were "some endearingly horrific blunders at work."  She was stupid. I didn't find it "enlivened with refreshingly unsentimental humor." It was pathetic.  There was nothing "charmingly original." Charmingly??? If this is an example of an author who "manages to keep the tone hopeful" - I'd hate to read something really depressing 
 My mom left this book at my house. So I thought..."Hey, free book." If you read quickly and frequently you should go ahead and give this a try. If you are a slow reader. . .spend your time on something with more substance. After a fairly long drawn-out story with little humor and not much suspense I was surprised to find the final chapters to be reasonably satisfying.   Hence the two stars. But I assure you there is zero "kung-fu" in this one 
 This record simply does not match the overall quality and cleverness of 68 comeback special's "Ignition" and that's why it's a disappointment.  Although it starts out with a great rock tune in "Sixty Years" it sets a somewhat depressing tone for the rest of the record.  Gone is the witty lyrics of 68cbs and are placed with dull phrases such as, "I think the bar next door is gay." Gone is the mind-boggling guitar work we know he is capable of and the swearing seems out of character and a bit unnecessary.  The record seems very raw and if I remember correctly, these tracks were cut a few years before they were actually released.  I understand the desire for artists to expand or try different things simply to keep themselves interested in their career; unfortunately this is a disappointing follow up to a far superior record in "Ignition. 
 Gail Griffith writes very well and this is indeed a gripping story.  Lots of compassion is demonstrated for suicidal and depressed teens.  Nevertheless the book is very one-sided and misguided in its presentation of the benefits of antidepressant therapy.  This is particularly surprising in light of the fact Will so clearly demonstrates adverse side effects, even the beginning of serotonin syndrome, well before his suicide attempt.  This is not surprising in light of the enormous doses of three different drugs that he had only been taking for a relatively short time - enormous for someone only 17 years of age, 6 feet tall and reputedly less than 150 pounds, very thin for that height.  He was nauseous, vomiting and had significant memory loss.  In addition his suicide notes are examples of a dissociative state, in which one feels one is watching from outside oneself with no real sense of the consequences of one's actions, that has been reported repeatedly by survivors of antidepressant harm.  The fact that his own doctor and the doctors who endorse the book do not recognize this is a sorry testimony to the influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the psychiatric profession.  The other endorsements come ironically from Andrew Solomon and Paul Raeburn who have themselves inadvertently described adverse events dramatically in their own writing.  I hope readers will examine more critically the differences between underlying depression and the adverse effects of mind altering drugs.  
 I hate lawyers.  What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.   Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"   Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.   But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.   Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.   I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?  What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.   Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.   Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.   So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.   Talk about contempt of court.  Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.   Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.   Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.   Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.   Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.    Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.   If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.   Otherwise, case dismissed.   JS 
 I  LOVE  THE  NOW  SERIES  BUT  NOT  NOW  21.  NOW  21  IS  TOO  MUCH  RAP.  I  LIKE  NELLY  "GRILLZ"  BUT  NONE  OF  THE  OTHER  RAP  ON  THIS  CD.  AND  I   THINK  IT'S  MESSED  UP  THAT  ONLY  ONE  COUNTRY  SONG  IS  ON  THRERE.  NOW  USED  TO  BE  ALL  POP  LIKE  'NSYNC  AND  BACKSTREET  BOYS.  WHAT  HAPPENED 
 I just didn't like this book very much. While it may have been a case of personal taste this book didn't seem very engaging or interesting. It was an interesting idea to begin with but the book seemed to drag on and on. It could have been a lot better than it was. I wouldn't recomend it. 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 I give it 2 1/2 stars.The first movie,the 1980 sappy tear-jerker should be seen with a female that you're either trying to impress or someone you're already involved with.I thought the original was okay.Plenty of beautiful scenic shots and decent job of acting by the two teens(that were ship wrecked years earlier)that are in love.Richard(Chistopher Atkins)and Emmeline(Brook Shields)experience a life together that is nearly impossible in the real world.Some nice nude scenes from(what I assume)to be a stand in for Shields.The sequel 'Return To...' (1991)I thought was a complete waste of time and trouble.Didn't even come close to standing up to the first film.Upside is it comes with the original,anyway 
 This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.   "Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.  Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.  By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience. 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 That model costs just a few dollars more and comes with an additional powered hand-held tool, and also a hard-floor cleaning tool, both of which this model lacks. The lack of adaquate tools means that this model is very difficult to use on stairs or for cleaning large hardwood floors 
 I've got to say that I really wanted to love this one.  It has been described using adjectives and analogies so appealing to me (minimal, heavy, Melvins, etc.)  Yet every time I listen, I just feel like I'm back in high school, late at night in my buddy's basement, bored as hell, listening to two stoned dudes trip out with their guitars.  Maybe the other reviewers have better stereos or better drugs, but this one just doesn't live up to its promise for me 
 I really didn't like this.  The idea for the seer was interesting enough, I suppose, but it wasn't executed well.  And Vesputo... first of all, who the heck names a character Vesputo?  It screams cliche.  Anyways, he was just sort of... semi-evil.  Like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of Generation X with the goatee and the shirt that says "I AM THE VILLAN" or some other rot like that.  It just didn't work.  And the whole... 'random assasination of the king' thing wasn't done that well.  I had to read it twice, because I was like "Eh?  What the *heck* just happened here?".  And the romance was something that you'd expect a third grader to write... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it's all "MY LOVE!" and they haven't seen each other for what, a decade or so?  It's kind of ridiculous.  So all in all, it's something like three and a half stars for concept, minus two for execution.  But Amazon doesn't let me do half stars 
 It is interesting to read all the reviews here. I notice the reviews that begin -- "I know nothing about the Celts, their history, their religious beliefs...." then tend to gush on about how wonderful and thrilling and enlightening the White Goddess is. The reviews that begin -- "I know something about the Celts, their history and beliefs" then tend to continue with rational arguments explaining why The White Goddess is nonsense from beginning to end. So, for those who know nothing -- here is a quick course in Celtic history. The Celts were not Hebrews, Greeks, or Scythians. They didn't worship a Triple Goddess. They did not have a tree calendar based on the Oghams. I am proud of my Celtic heritage and find the White Goddess eternally annoying. Robert Graves was not a Celtic scholar. His theories disagree wildly with the theories of his own grandfather -- Charles Graves -- who was a respected scholar. Robert Graves takes a little bit of Welsh myth, a little bit of Irish myth, a lot of Greek myth, a lot of Bible myth, some ogham letters and mixes it all up into a warm mush perfect for the nourishment of fluffy-bunnies. This is  a bad book, based on a daft premise, and reading it is a waste of time 
 This toaster is more a decoration than anything else. My kids eat a lot of bagels & frozen waffles, and this machine just doesn't do the job without multiple toasting cycles. Even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle. I also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place, break off. (How?? it just sits on the counter, no one is playing football with it!) I feel that I wasted $50.00 on this- save your money 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 although the main part of the case in which my camera resides is useful, I was dismayed when I received it as the strap had one clip broken and the first time I opened and closed the additional pocket, the zipper broke.  The only reason I have not returned it for a new one is that the cost of shipping would make it too expensive 
 It worked for me! My car is now a blistering 120 degrees as opposed to the scorching 121 degrees a month ago. The only thing I ever got out of this product was screwed. I've been bamboozled!! Don't believe the hype; stand up against the man!, Chumps unite! God! what a piece of poo. 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business 
 A loony segment of the far left embraces a combination of pop ecology, Darwinism (of the Dawkins variety), a Rousseauesque delusion about the nobility of primitive hunter-gatherers, some old fashioned Chicken Little apocalypticism  and a smattering of terrorism.  Mr. Jensen, a grungy neo-Luddite, promotes all of the above in his hysterical denouncement of western civilization, particularly its capitalist manifestation.  In case you hadn't already figured it out, human beings are ecological vermin. When we developed beyond the level of wandering savages we began to infringe upon the rights of salmon and spotted owls.  The planetary crisis is now so dire that we should welcome the collapse of the modern world along with a steep drop in human population.  In other words, before we kill the planet we should politely kill ourselves because, as Mr. Jensen believes, it's a zero sum game of Gaia versus us.  Mr. Jensen, who repeatedly reminds us that he was molested by his father and that he fantasizes about blowing up a damn, appears to have regressed into an infantile dreamland where he is the hippie prophet of doom condemning the West's patriarchal rationality and its cultural achievements.  The book is interesting as long as you don't take it seriously and recognize that the author is undergoing therapy by publishing his scribblings.  I gave the book two stars because I found it was amusing enough to actually finish it.  The author's style is sometimes confessional and he provides an interesting peek into the psyche of a disaffected soul who  converted his spiritual nihilism into hatered for European civilization 
 Brian trys to move into a different direction and fails on most of the selections.  While growth of an artist is expected sometimes it doesn't work 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 **1/2  "Free Radicals" is a stark, slow-moving meditation on the randomness of life.  Matching style to theme, this Austrian film relates a half dozen or so barely connected stories, all of which deal with the part fate and luck play in determining the direction of our lives.  In some cases, the characters are the victims of accidents or illness, while in others they becomes prisoners of their own needs and desires.  In all the cases, however, the characters live a drab, loveless existence, filled with unfulfilled dreams and loneliness.  Although the film begins with an interesting premise, the overall effect is so off-putting and depressing that we really can't enjoy the movie on anything but the most purely intellectual level.  The people here just seem so miserable and unhappy that we want to get away from them as quickly as possible and head back to our own lives, imperfect though they might be.  Perhaps by including so many characters, the film dilutes its focus, making it hard for us to fully identify with any one person and make us care about his or her fate.  Despite good acting, this crazy quilt approach turns the movie into more of a clinical exercise than a deeper involving human drama, and lends it an air of greater pretentiousness than it might otherwise have had.    Enter the world of "Free Radicals" if you must, but you might want to take some Prozac along with you to help get you through it 
 This book should forever remain in print just to illustrate, in black and white, how immoral, calculated, and disgraceful the rightwing element is in America.  Like Mein Kampf before it, this book justifies war as simply another instrument of policy, just another tool among many to implement change.  Of course, all the rationales used in it are false, and the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq lays bare for all to see the arrogance, wrongness, and decadence of this rightwing element.  It is sad that, though we thought we had rid the world of fascism, there are those who, wittingly or otherwise, fall under its spell.  Kristol absolutely has the sticky blood of fallen American troops on his hands, lives lost futiley and vainly for an obscure, unnecessary cause.  There will be no domino chain reaction of democracy in the Middle East, we are not seen as liberators, and Bush, devoid of an exit strategy, continues to bumble his way through the slog of quagmire.  The only thanks we can give to Kristol, et al is the satisfaction of knowing that, in their pursuit to make war just another instrument of policy, they have ensured that America will not be willingly going to war again for a very, very long time 
 Hey, c'mon.  Whoever thought this book would be good for children is just saying that because it was illustrated by Sendak.  I got it in a group of books from a sale and I have 2 kids ages 3 and 5.  I am all for teaching about injustices and the plight of the homeless but it takes an adult with a masters degree to "appreciate"  the message and illustrations here.  Don't buy it for anyone under the age of 30 
 First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos.  Thus this ship was something of a disappointment.  As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it.  The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it.  Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it.  So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details 
 I bought this set to add to the single 4 piece set I bought at a  retail store several years ago, which I was totally satisfied with, and Pfaltzgraff isn't what it use to be. My original set was made here in the U.S. and was perfect and defect free. This new set comes by way of China and it shows. Obvious flaws and defects were found on several pieces, one of the dinner plates now has clearly visible scratch marks on it just from eating off of it ONCE! I suspect I will be replacing this set a lot sooner than anticipated. My made in the States set looks brand new after all the years I've had it now. That's why I bought Pfaltzgraff again. I'm sorry I did. It's a shame to see a company sacrifice quality and reputation for the sake of profit!!! Also be wary of buying online. My first shipment had several broken plates in it upon arrival and I had to request a second set be sent to me. That process did go smooth and I was credited for the first set I sent back at Amazon's expense. Bottom line is Pfaltzgraff disappoints me they need to seriously review their quality control of their over seas production 
 I was looking forward to reading this book but have been truly disappointed.  There are some redeeming features but they do not outweigh the negatives.  The writing at times seems disjointed and too full of names that I did not care about - seemed also like namedropping - not to impress but to give notice, either notice of thanks or notice of disappointment.  There were far too many names mentioned.  My thought upon finishing this book was that she kept a diary, wrote the book from it, and had someone edit the book who was not very skilled.  I expected to be informed and inspired and I was not 
 and now the ghosts of the aztec return to the land they never left  MacBush trembles as his slain Banquo shakes his bloody hoary head at the state banquet  heck about one half of the continental USA was MExico for centuries until anglo invaders squatted and invaded 150 years ago and declared it theirs. Look at the history of TExas for instance. The MExicans are simply coming home, or remaining where they never really left  BUchanan, grandson of illegal immigrants, Pat Buchanan, an apologist for the corporate capitalism that is destroying our nation, culture and our free democratic ideals. Do not believe a word from this hypocritical inhuman effete lying liar, former speechwriter for the great Liar "Not a crook" Nixon and the utterly vile criminal GOP VP and tax evader Spiro Agnew. So now Patty has his own hired mouth and greedy ghostwriter. CHeck the copyright.   Ever wonder how so many old Jewish Democrats and African Americans in Florida voted for the ancient bigot Buchanan in the 2000 election, whose bigotry and prejudice and propagandistic disinformation campaign glow so harshly in this miserable book? The butterfly ballot was so rigged that anyone with poor eye sight and/or less than acute reading skills would punch out Buchanan's hole rather than the intended Gore hole. Algore won 2000; America lost. Everything and forever.   One star is an infinity too many for Patty's traitorous garbage  Get the Honorable Senator Byrd's brave book "Losing America" for a truer view of how and to whom we lost our revolutionary constitutional democracy  We once had jobs and room for everyone but now Wall Street and their Washington puppets send all of the jobs overseas to cheaper slave labor in China and leave us with no industry. Huge agribusiness sneaks slave labor across our border in what their boy George Bush calls a "guest worker" indentured slave system, in order to bust our own citizens who need a living wage in America. THese are the enemies of America, the wealthy multi-national corporations that pay Patty to parrot this claptrap propaganda that distracts us from the true enemy of America, the loss of our jobs and our constitution and our human, civil and voting rights. 
 Very disappointed in this product and Amazon's response to the problem.  Item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until I complained that it was not included,  this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed. They have told me they can't supply the missing part  (the metal neck strap showing in the photo) as item comes from a freight forwarder.    I did not get what I paid for and unable to return  because item has been forward shipped out of the country 
 I've had very bad experience with this vacuum. It is bulky, heavy, and inconvenient. Also, the cord is too short if used in a big house. Carrying it up and down stairs -- forget about it! After all these trouble the engine got fried. Then, the interesting part started. I contacted Sanyo for warranty work. They referred me to some service center, which was out of business. After going back and forth they accepted their mistake and pointed me to some other place which is very far from me and I am in Chicago area! So, there is 1 Service center to serve 12 million people. Don't buy it! Horrible product, plus no service 
       Never before has such a poorly written book received such acclaim. Maya Angelou wrote this story not with candor and grace but with a bias rarely allowed to sit on shelves let alone the top of a best-seller list. She was not humorous but had a heinousness of character and action that places her beyond the limits of human pity. This "inspiring author" did not demonstrate poignancy and depth but the crude rudiments of writing skill below that found in the essays of a primary school student.               Maya Angelou has portrayed herself as a victim of fate and yet at best her actions can only be described as foolhardy. In an attempt to prove to herself that she isn't a lesbian (a term she apparently doesn't understand) she initiates a deed without thinking of the consequences. She repeatedly gratifies her ego by exalting her academic accomplishments, yet doesn't grasp the fallacies of her own actions until it is far too late.             Several fans have seen her as an example to women. I must disagree with this ardently. Every teenage girl using her as a role model and demonstrating such lack of forethought puts herself at risk for sexual assualt, neglect, STDs, and teen pregnancy.             My only hope for this book is a quick and discreet cremation. May her name never be mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Atwood or any other great modern writer of either gender, and ANY nationality 
 Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.  
 I belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially Universities, a little too much.  In the beginning when he makes this assertion that Universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few African Americans in the Universities that they are  racist or something like that.  Furthmore since the Military has more  African Americans it is a better instiution.  Here is a better explanation.   Universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  The Army will take anyone it can get its hands on. I just did  not like the Authors atitutde that the whole is racist. Furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  I love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses Heavy Metal and Rock n Roll, both  white music!  In fact Heavy Metal is white protest music against Black  music!  Do some research or think before writting a book 
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 As below, this book does not include birds in the other peterson guides.  Far better books are out there 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 This MAN does not understand estrogen at all. It is sad that so many women are apparently putting their health into his hands. The reason why so many women and good clinicians are avoiding products like Tri-est is because these products don't feed our bodies the necessary estrogens that our bodies actually produce from our ovaries. Giving women estriol and estrone just blocks our receptors from receiving the necessary and most important E2-estradiol. Our bodies will then metabolize the E2 into the others naturally. Research supports this aspect clearly. The other thing about this guy and his book is that he bounces everything he says off of premarin studies and does not keep the information flow consistent one way or another.  Most women getting on bio-identical hormones these days have never used premarin and want good research or clinical comparatives to support their choices with regards to bio-identicals. This book does not provide either good knowledge or research. Additionally, this book is quite disappointing for one that Amazon places so highly in their search engine.  Instead, I would recommend Wiley's book for the radical approach to understanding what it is we actually want to achieve with our bio-identicals, and Reiss's book for good information on how to monitor ourselves when using bio-identicals. However, Reiss, (another boy doctor) is also a proponent of Tri-est, probably because its just easier for him to prescribe.  Once our female clinicians have really worked out the bio-identicals that are working well for us, then we will all have great data to support our choices. In the meantime, avoid this book 
 With the word "ACCLERATED" I thought it would mean atleast at little bit above average. But I should have heeded the words of previous reviewers:  FOR BEGINNERS ONLY.  And beginners still would get alot more help from books like Flash Mx 2004 visually or How to do everything Flash mx 2004 
 HE STILL NEEDS TO STUDY MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY ON WHAT THE OLDEST CULTURE OF HERBS ARE AND PLUS HE NEEDS TO STUDY MORE ON HOW OLD THE VEDAS ARE. ALL HE HAS KNOWLEDGE ON IS THE BIBLE AND HE SHOULD STICK TO THAT, WHAT HE KNOW BEST. BECAUSE THE BIBLE AND THE VEDAS ARE TWO DIFFERENT BOOKS 
 Self proclamation does not a doctor make.  Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years.  She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her.  Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public.  Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent 
 Its ok.  Of course if you take a philosophy class in todays secular universities, you will read 20 things by hume and other atheists and not much pro theism.  His work is ok, but I actually used it as part of a proof that God does exist 
 This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book 
   Bought this book for reading material on a business trip.  I found it very slow to get going and strangely depressing.  The plot - terrorist hijackers, as usual - didn't get under way until almost halfway through the book.  The first part was a lot of run-of-the-mill potboiling and military exercise.  The action section was really gory, almost to the point of making me wince.  Not in a good way either.  I didn't really see the point.  All in all Vertical Dive is a pretty hack pulp fiction testosterone trip without anything new to say.  Spend your eight bucks elsewhere 
 If you are interested in information about real estate training programs or how to get a job in real estate this is the book for you.  75 pages of at 225 page book are dedicated to listing of different real estate  programs, most of which are located at community colleges. The rest of the  book is dedicated to finding your first job in real estate.  I did not find  this book very helpful.  I found "Your Successful Real Estate  Career" by Kenneth Edwards to be much more useful 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 YOU, ME AND DUPREE is a formula film, a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth, noisy, crude guy things movies.  There have been a lot of these films of late (all spinoffs of The Wedding Crasher image) and one wonders if there is a saturation point.  Relating the story is rather pointless as it is a one-line joke (?).  Dupree (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) is the best man at his buddy Matt Dillon's wedding to Kate Hudson (the You and Me) and subsequently moves in with them, causing all manner of mayhem and bad taste and faux pas and grim situations (think toilet problems etc).  And that is it.  Michael Douglas was brought in to play a flat role as Kate Hudson's father who objects to her marriage blah blah blah. Ask directors Anthony and Joe Russo for the rest.   We know that Hudson, Dillon and Douglas have much better roles to offer (Wilson seems to have found his niche), and the only reason films like this keep getting made is because they make money (for some reason) at the box office.  The film is silly, tacky, tired and should only be rented if the shelves in the video store are otherwise empty...   Grady Harp, November 06  
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 Well if you want to see Angelina Jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy, if you don't then leave the movie alone it's just another teen rebelion movie 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 This DVD Was Both A Waste Of Time (only 49 Minutes Long) And Money. If You Enjoy Pissing Away Your Cash And Wasting Time Waiting For Something To Be Funny This Is Your DVD. However If You Like To Laugh And Work Hard For Your Money And Spend It Wisely Steer Clear Of This. Sorry Gilbert, I Usually Enjoy Your Humor, But There Was None Of That Here. I Actually Feel Sorry For The People Who Were At The Taping Of This Disc Having To Sit Though This Wreck 
 In Dr Yang's DVD I expected to find a good reference for my practice of the Yang 108 form, but I am very displeased with the quality of the DVD. For the price that I paid, I expected a least good video quality. When Dr. Yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor; there are close ups of the upper body and obviously, the movement of the legs is not seen; you get lost with changes of camera angles; at some point, you can see people in the background; and the stage is not properly set up. Also, and with all due respect, his movements are weird. I have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the Yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed. Definitively I do not recommend this DVD to any one who wants to use it as a reference, you can use it as a movie 
 This book has only one piece of new information than his prior book the book states the safety in construction and tollerences important dims are given also but no new info. could have put this in prior book with less than 10 page 
 Don't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like I did.   The earlier ARTISAN release is still much better than this special edition.   The image is better and ALSO the sound.   I don't know what Lions gate thought they were doing, but remastered? no.   I compared both several times before writing this even though I only had to compare once.   Might as well wait for a HD DVD to come out, this is a waste unless you want the additional features 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 Our dogs didn't even notice it.  We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers.  I was wrong - the kept on barking.. 
 The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the author  doesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period 
 Reading Larry Niven's thoughts on the publishing world in  "Playgrounds of the Mind" and "N Space" gives a good  insight into why this book was published: simply to fulfill a contract.  As  usual, the concept is very strong.  The story develops nicely and then ends  in mid-thought.  As an avowed Larry Niven fan, I was extremely  disappointed 
  I enjoy reading everyone's reviews, and respect their opinions. To R. Towles " Nostalgia Fan "; Thank God for an African American who finally sees this show for what it is and reports that he feels so highly about Amos and Andy. It "erks" me to see so many people putting this show down, based on the fact that they feel it puts the African American race in a bad light. Mr. Towles sees what any thinking person sees, that this is a wonderfully funny show, with wonderful and talented actors who deserve to be watched and enjoyed by present day audiences as it was by past audiences. As he says, there are many shows now and in the recent past which are  similar to Amos and Andy, in content, and which have never been treated like this show. Bill Cosby went on a crusade to try and keep this show from being seen on TV, and it looks as if he will be successful for all time to come. Thank God for their release on DVD. To ZEGNORCH and his comment about these 44 "EPPIES" being all that are available. They aren't. Depending on where you look and who sells them, some unethical, there are 71-73 TV episodes and the 2 cartoons and movie. Amos and Andy is the hardest show I have ever seen to find  reliable information on. After looking on every Web Site selling the shows, and finding that they differ in most everything they say about it, I have come to believe that the sellers will say anything in order to make a sell. Saying theirs is THE definitive collection, all available episodes are included, saying they sell only quality discs and others use DVD-R and DVD+R copies, to one seller admitting to me, in an E-mail reply to a question I asked him, that he sold copies he made on his home DVD recorder and sold them on E-Bay. Please be aware of these problems so ,hopefully, we can all get the very best copies of any program we wish to own. They are selling for anywhere from $24.99 - $300.00 per collection. Some sellers are not telling the truth, in order to make money. I do not know anything about the quality, origin, or about the producer of this collection. Buyer Beware !     
 The disco dancing they show is so outdated even for the early 90s.  It is the worst tape I have ever bought.  I thought they looked like fools flaring their arms about while two stepping! Definitely not worth the money 
 Beware of  assuming that  the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct  size.  It wasn't even close.  No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 I purchased this book for the star pattern on the front. The directions were incomplete (perhaps poorly written "continue around" instead of continue 6 times-- this makes a difference when you are counting complex stitches and have to do something else before finishing the round). There are no drawings to explain complicated sequences, no symbols used. Except for the  star afghan, the patterns are lacking in style and design. I would not reccommend 
 Five crime stories. I read the first. Damn, ain't no way to solve the thing until you read the last page, and I waded through all kinds of cardboard cutouts and cliches to get there. I quit reading. 
 I fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with Jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal.  However, then the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began, and the antiquated ideas about "provocation of rape" were ceaselessly unpealed.  Leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed, how she acted, if she flirted.  Reflections of a bygone era when a crime wasn't a crime, but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line.  But even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter, often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end.  No smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble.  Just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor's awareness of  the victims paternal history.  Nonsense, and 3 hours down the tubes. However, the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge, and the appearance of a young George C. Scott, who at that age was interestingly a deadringer for Michael Douglass.  Jimmy does a stand-up job as always 
 The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material.  She provides lists of correspondences.  Fine, could be useful.  What it does not do is provide any real information.  We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style "vision quests" or "seekings," encounters the author alleges to have experienced.  These "experiences" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book.  Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.  There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's "Native American family."  (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)  She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully.  The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing.  (An example:  the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff.  A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal.  So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff?  With runes, no less.)  Even more suspiciously, many of her "Native American teachings" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.  Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored "rays" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.  The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians.  I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture.  (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.)  And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public.  Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'?  If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?  Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'.  They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.  Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read.  Waste of space on my bookshelf.  Waste of trees to print it.  Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in.  I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit. 
 Very disapointing! Too much off topic information. It has only some information on devils, demons and the nephilim, and nothing at all on the return of the nephilim. Strange when you consider the title. I do not feel good about this purchase or the misleading reviews.   PS. I don't know why "Son of Bigfoot" shows up on my reviewer name.       
 This book is so bad. The first two chapters are good,But each page gets worse and worse after that. The only reason i finished the book was because i was waiting for it to get better. I live in new york. This book has nothing to do with new york in any way. When i first saw the books cover i thought.. this should be a good book. Boy was i wrong. 
 You know how some books create characters and a world you love so much, you try to read slower because you don't want the book to end?  This is not one of those books.  I'm a fairly fast reader so I always finish any book I start.  I have never regretted this policy more than now.  I am three quarters of the way through this book and the end can't some soon enough for me.  The best part of the book was the lengthy "Acknowledgement".  The author seems to be a nice person and I feel bad panning her book but if I can save anyone the misery I'm in, I have to do it.  If you want vampire/romance, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton 
 This had a lot of basic information on ADD, but it wasnt very interesting. It didn't offer a lot of practical help either. Most of what was in it I already knew. I don't recommend this book. 
 After hearing mountains of praise for Discworld, I thought I'd give it a go. This book has completely turned me off to continuing the series. Pratchett has failed the fantasy genre where Adams has suceeded for sci-fi. The humor was helter-skelter and it seemed that Pratchett tried (too) hard to offer nonchalant zaniness 
  I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the "CHINOOK State", Mt.St. Helens did not have "LAVA" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a "PAIR of winds" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal.                                                         
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 My experience is the same as the other two reviewer. This crockpot has a design flaw that the condensation leaks out. I will not leave anything cooking in this crockpot while I am away. Too dangerous 
 This book is a bit dated.  There is no use for this book if you want to get into this business on a serious basis.  Poor style, poor grammar and very poor content.  The author devoted 75 pages on trade agreements such as NAFTA and the EU.  You don't need to know the technical details of these agreements.  You need to sell, sell and sell.  This book is very bad.  If you want a primer on the ins and outs buy get Exporting, Importing and Beyond.  After that, buy Building an Import/Export Business by Weiss (this book gives you techniques that are absolutely useless but it is important to know this...so you don't do what he advises).  You can round it off by buying How Small Business Trades Worldwide by John Wiley Spiers who gives a no-nonesense approach.  Back to this book.  Carl Nelson really needs to update this book to include E-bay and recommend Frontpage or Dreamweaver to create a Website instead of saying it is "easy" to use HTML.  In this business, a website isn't necessary but it may be a good idea to have one if you want to market directly to consumers. Also, consider getting into this business by starting off as a Manufacturers representative (consider William H. Krause book on How to Get Started as a Manufacturer Representative) This book was plain AWFUL.  
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 I purchased a copy of Foundation's Fear, eagerly looking forward to reading more into the Foundation universe. Though I expected it to be different from Asimov's books to a certain degree, as this was inevitable, I didn't expect this.  I have to agree with many of the other reviewers when I say that this book just doesn't fit into the Foundation universe. Benford does state in the back of the book that he isn't trying to write a mock-Asimov, but a Benford Foundation novel, and is not attempting to write in Asimov's style. This is fine with me... to a point.   Not only did he write in a completely different style, he changed the very nature of the characters (not to mention the spelling of  Dors' last name, at least in printing that I own...). Since this book is supposed to take place in between two novels already written by Asimov, this change in the characters is not fitting. Characters suddenly use a completely new vocabulary, and "speak" in an entirely different fashion. Ideas and technologies are presented as so commonplace, and even integral in this novel that were not present in Asimov's novels that surrounded the time period in the series. Asimov himself did this between books, where periods of time allow for technological change, but it doesn't work in the fashion that Benford inserts it into a period of time already described by Asimov.  On top of this character change, the very plot of the novel is really quite pointless. It delves into subplots that are rather absurd for the Foundation universe, made worse in that they serve no real purpose. To those of you who have not read it, I will tell you only that Joan of Arc and Voltaire make presenses in this book, and large portions of it, at that. It simply doesn't feel Foundation-esque, and doesn't provide any material that makes the Foundation puzzle feel more complete, despite it's events occuring in the Foundation universe.  If you can stand not reading every book with the word "Foundation" in the title, skip this one. Find a summary, and move on to Foundation & Chaos, which is much better and more in tune to the Foundation universe. You won't miss much 
 When McCartney was with the Beatles, he was more or less held in check as a songwriter by John Lennon, who really was the guiding force behind the Beatles sound. Without that balance, McCartney went off on his own and basically, became less and less discerning. Or, maybe he just felt that his fans weren't that sophisticated. I suppose we'll never know.   Anyway, McCartney's first solo albums were Beatle-type stuff, and really, not bad. Then came, "Band on the Run" which marked a turning point, and typifies the rest of McCartney's work. I can't imagine how anyone can listen to this sort of garbage without recalling the great sound of the Beatles and songs like, "I Call Your Name", "You Can't Do That", "Drive My Car", or "I Feel Fine".   When artist and musician Robert Crumb was once asked why he killed off one of his comic book characters, "Fritz the Cat", Crumb replied that the character had become "too cute" and "needed killing."   After hearing "Silly Love Songs", "Jet", "Band on the Run", "Listen to What the Man Said", and "Let 'Em In" being piped in through the public address systems of every grocery store and retail chain I've been in for the last decade, I pretty much feel the same way about Paul McCartney's music:  It's too cute, and it needs to go away. 
 Purchase this book (used, if possible), tear out the title page, then give the book to a friend and pay her to read it. Once she's slogged through it, ask her to estimate the year of its writing. Few readers will venture guesses much past 1985.   One suspects that this laughably reactionary manuscript was a long time in the peddling. However, with its call for a return to art as "a source of aesthetic delectation and spiritual refreshment," it is such fun to read aloud at parties.  In plodding prose with serrated edges, Kimball is nostalgic for a time that never was in his fetishes for "decorum," "civility," and "modesty," all "dandy" virtues that he positions as antipodal to intellectual activity or interpretation of any kind. This book paints a picture of a world of art that is, at its best, reassuringly literal, neatly narrative, and, after all, decorative.   In a muddled battle of authorial intent vs. contemporary art historical scholarship, The Rape of the Masters encourages the reader to return to the tiny chairs, soft tones, and primary colors of a preschool classroom, where everything was what it was, and the teacher was awful pretty. It was so much simpler then. 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 This book had so many chances to develop thought-provoking story lines, but instead jumped out of a story as quickly as it was started.  The characters were quite bland, as many weren't even given a chance to be explored before the focus changed yet again.  This was an easy read in terms of the length, but a hard read due to boring storylines 
 In her book, Kathleen Brown offers a revision of colonial Virginia history. Relying almost entirely upon previously known and explored primary materials, she constructs an argument that gender heavily influenced colonial development.        Breaking her book up chronologically into three parts, Brown focuses first on England and the Virginia colony's early days. In discussing the former, she establishes the role of women who adhere to social behavioral norms as that of good wives, and those who do not adhere to those norms as nasty wenches. In the case of Virginia, she explores the role of women in English society vis a vis Powhatan's Algonquian society. When Powhatan offered women to English settlers, whether for marriage or a night's enjoyment, he did so for political reasons; the settlers, however, thought Indians valued women less, and differently, than they did. Settlers further grappled with the fact that women farmed while men, they thought, took it easy, hunting and fishing.        The second part focuses on the change in roles of women, and the corresponding change in how men though of them. As Virginia became more permanent, and as slaves became more prevalent, "good wives" came to mean the elite women, whereas "nasty wenches" meant servant or non-elite women. Following Bacon's Rebellion, this labeling shifted somewhat as elite men attempted to break the unofficial alliance between black slaves and white servants. Principally, the violations of white women that formerly would have made them nasty wenches now were less serious, while those same violations of black women were more so.        The last part explores the domination of men and the lives of elite women. Men became much more patriarchal, establishing social norms and laws to that effect. They were "anxious" in the sense that they were now required to hold domination over their wives, families, and farms, and maintain strict adherence to those norms and laws. Relying heavily on the writings of William Byrd II and Landon Carter, Brown points out the fears these men had of declining virility, disobedient sons, and the like. Women, meanwhile, came together against their husbands, quietly undermining them on occasions, especially in discipline issues, and generally developing a women's society of tea parties and such.        On the one hand, Brown's revisionist attempt is a worthwhile endeavor; only the foolish would say women had no role or impact whatsoever in colonial development. As historians have largely ignored or downplayed this role, her study is therefore relevant. On the other hand, she delves far too deeply into the sex lives of leading men. Her study was not one solely of the role of gender, but also of sexuality. To a certain and very limited extent that exploration is worthwhile-certainly the colonists were concerned with fornication, bastardy and the like-but do I, the reader, really need to know on which days Byrd gave his wife a "flourish," and whether or not he was "vigorous"? No. Furthermore, certain inherent flaws exist in a reinterpretation that relies heavily on modern and liberal views of sex and sexuality. Consequently, there are certain aspects of the book that are worth reading, but one should select those aspects carefully. 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 I had a hard time putting the book down.  I kept reading hoping the book would reveal some item beyond the obvious.  Schmitt spends 200 pages explaining that customer experience should be at the forefront when launching a new product or designing a marketing campaign.  I dare say Schmitt would be hard pressed to find a CEO that doesn't taut the value of good customer experience or the importance of retaining customers.  Where Schmitt falls drastically short is tying customer experience activities to financial decisions companies make every day.  This is perhaps the largest challenge those of us in customer retention or customer marketing face every day.  It is great to ascertain that companies should improve customer support to provide a better customer experience to retain more customers.  However, how does a manager position a $200,000 call center upgrade vs. a $200,000 product enhancement?  According to Schmitt both are valuable in the Customer Experience framework.  With limited lip service to "regression modeling" and "customer surveys" there is no valuable guidance to help a customer experience focused manager position their projects against other expenditures within a company.  Schmitt could take a few pages out of Jim Collins' work to better tie customer experience initiatives to corporate financial success. 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 A very linear story and not very captivating. This book is definitely being returned. By ODA 391's own admission, if it had not been for the Javelin and some incredibly poorly aimed direct fire and artillery fire from the enemy Roughneck would've been toast.  There is nothing really insightful, we learn basically nothing about each character and their individuality other than Major X being completely incompetent in the battlefield. The only saving grace of the book and of the lives saved was the excellent work borne by the SF Medics. Look elsewhere to find something interesting, captivating and insightful 'cause you armchair warriors won't find it here 
 First let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician. i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius, and i could barely keep from turning it off, actually, i did turn it off. quite unattractive really. turns out Beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all. he may have been a great musician, but that is not really the focus of this movie. in fact, there is no focus in this movie, except that he was a jerk.     If you want to watch a great movie about a great man, I suggest the "The Endurance". Enrest Shackleton will make you want to punch people like this Beethoven character.  It will blow you away. 
 Slow, confusing, not very believable, (and to top it off Pink is beyond irritating).  I was very disappointed in this installment in the Irene Adler series.  As a long time fan I have been quite disappointed in the last two book 
 I bought this garbage truck for my 3 year old son. He was thrilled when he saw it and for the first time he played with a toy by himself for more than an hour! HOWEVER after an hour the back end was broken as well as the mirrors and he got very upset. This truck looks great, but it is not durable. If it was $10 that wouldn't be a problem but for $60 it should have lasted for more than an hour 
 I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck.  When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler.  Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler."  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker!  If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.   There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.   So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list. 
   Intelligent persons like Kauffman are close to accept Nietzsche's     believes, but the religious need, blind their minds 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 This book should have been a hard back and it isn't! I will be returning it as the order was incorrect 
 Just finished a HF course and this was the required text for the course.  This text is awful.  Very poor writing, incorrect or misleading info is presented, in the area's of work physiology, etc.  The author did not explore or offer ANY additional insight in area's such as bio-mechanics etc.. HUGE sections of the text are pure quotes from other sources.. Very poor.. All I can say is thank goodness I was able to sell the book 
 I bought both this book and Al Linders Walleye book. Save your money and do not buy this book. Al's books are extremely detailed and full of uselful techniques covering all situations for walleye fishing. Great on the biology and life cycle of these fish. This book was not worth the money 
 I'm not sure who was in charge of putting this dvd set together but I think they definately dropped the ball in the production of this season release.  You wouldn't ever see Law and Order or Seinfeld release a "Best of Season x" dvd leaving out certain less popular or less watched episodes.  I would have been perfectly happy paying a little more to get the rest of this dvd set.  On top of that, the Negreanu/Lindgren Esfandiari/Laak commentairies accompanying the season 2 dvd set were a highlight and I think they ought to have expanded that to all the episodes.   Overall, you get a dvd of 8 of the wpt episodes, half of the season, no commentary, no notable special features, and if you happened to be looking to replay your favorite episode you may be disappointed because the WPT didn't deem it on of the "Best" episodes.   I hope this is the first and final truly second class product issued form the WPT.  
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 Ill-researched and wildly inaccurate.  If your ideal woman is barefoot and pregnant, you'll love it 
 If you picked up this book to help you build your existing business or build a new one, you might be disappointed. Since your thinking of starting your own business, then you should know that most small businesses fail within the first five years. The author hits on some reasons why they fail but most of these you already know. Do you know that if you are not organized, if you don't change or create new ideas or plans and become stagnat or if you force yourself to do every task yourself, your business will be limited in growth and may eventually fail? Right there is the first 25% of the book fit into one sentence. Then he goes onto his love affiar with turn key businesses. But when he starts talking about his favorite business it should make a reader nervous. He starts talking about the great sucess of McDonalds fast food restuarant franchise. McDonalds is a great success and one to be looked at carefully but not for the reasons he points out. It's apparent he has not been in a McDonalds all that often. He mentions that at McDonalds they depend on consistancy at all their chains. For example the fries stay in the fryer for ten minutes "a soggy french fry is not a McDonald's french fry". At any McDonalds a customer knows what to expect. Then he goes into mention that this is why McDonalds chain resturant is more successfull than those businesses that depend on trade name recognition. I'm sorry this throws a red flag. People eat there beacuse it is fast and it is [not expensive}, not becuase of consistant service. They make a large profit because they keep costs down. I do believe that McDonalds spends a large budget on trade name recognition, I have seen many commercials for McDonalds within the last year; particularly with the Olympics. This whole section undermines the rest of the author's book. If you know that a large section is misleading or biased it makes it difficult to listen to the rest the ideas without already being judgemental. I admit that I am not the smartest business person but its clear Michael Gerber isn't either 
 Clive Barker produced but did not write THE PLAGUE...but what a stinko movie. All the kids in the world under the age of 9 go into some kind of vegetative state; ten years later they awaken and start killing people.  Why?  We are never told..and the ending is the biggest copout of all. DAWSON CREEK's James van der Beek frowns throughout the movie, and Ivana Milocevic just looks bored; the movie makes no sense whatsoever, so don't waste your time like I did 
 The problem with this book is that it doesn't adress important issues facing our legal system today. If for example Ford motor company manufactures a SUV with a faultly shock system that fails and causes the truck to roll over resulting in serious injury or death, clearly we have an open and shut case where Ford is completely liable and you can certainly bet that Ford is going to make sure that problem never happens again. But that's obvious. Anyone who knows little to nothing about the law understands full well that a company who is found to have a faulty product will increase their standards and work feverishly to fix the product in order to prevent future legal action. Carl T. Bogus has taken simple ideas like those and twisted them around to create a driving force for his political agenda, and baseless political agenda no less.   "And although the public was largely unaware of it, George W. Bush's 'tort reform'-which seeks to constrict the ability of individuals to sue corporations-was a major factor in his raising unprecedented sums for his presidential candidacy." The public? Carl you're a law professor at an over priced, second rate university in the middle of Rhode Island. How does that give you a divine right to claim that you know more than the average person about the Bush administration and allow you to make an accusation like that based on no fact at all? Where are the fact checkers at NYU press anyways?    To the contrary when George W. Bush is speaking in terms of tort reform he is referring to torts that actually need reform. Let's look at Johnny Edwards (former vice presidential running mate to John Kerry) who specializes in malpractice suits specifically involving children born with cerebral palsy. He claims that if doctors had immediately performed Caesarean sections then the babies would have been spared the affliction. The results of such lawsuits have yielded 4 times as many C-sections performed since 1970, yet the number of children born with cerebral palsy has remained constant. In fact cerebral palsy is linked to fetal brain injury long before labor begins. Edwards has avoided cases where the children died at birth because typically juries only award roughly $500,000 in those situations. In 1985 Edwards was on a case dealing with a girl named Jennifer Campbell, a 5 year old with cerebral palsy, which ended up being an award of 6.5 million dollars for the plaintiffs. This is what president Bush means by "tort reform". In simple terms someone who spills a cup of hot coffee on themselves while pulling away from a drive through window should NOT be awarded any type of damage. Cases like these undermine the goals of the framers of the Constitution of the United States of America and place individuals freedoms in jeopardy. We have seesaws vanishing from playgrounds, emergency-room staff blocked from attending to patients off hospital grounds even if they can see them bleeding to death just 30 feet away, "Caution HOT" warning labels on cups of coffee that a Chimpanzee could identify as "hot" without referring to a warning label, removing of harmless 10 Commandment Icons from parks and courthouses, and Godless Pledges of Allegiances. This is the America we live in. As a professor of Law Mr. Bogus should be required to teach the "LAW"; NOT the principles of the Democratic party. This book is the result of an egotistical, politically driven, liberal professor at a law school that offers a free bowl of soup with every degree. I wish I had more hands so I could give this book four thumbs down 
  I bought this as my second fryer. The third time I used this fryer, the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid wouldn't close properly and that's the end of it.  Prior to buying this fryer, I had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine. 
 This was Heinlein's 1st novel; it wasn't published during his lifetime.  He wrote it prior to WWII.  It's emphasis is on his depression-era socio-political views, not on science fiction entertainment.  Thus, the plot is thin & the characters, though likable, aren't deeply drawn.  To his credit, he changed many of his views later--as many were rather naive &, perhaps, influenced by his frustration.  Some of his libertarian social innovations, however, were courageous & innovative, but would require considerable cultural development to become politically practical in the US.  But many (IMHO boring) pages are devoted to his economic/financial system, particularly the "card game" attacking free enterprise.  It is very naive--ignores intellectual capital, population expansion, & the money multiplier (the average dollar's spent 6x/year).  His "social credit/dividend" system is utopian to an extreme & p. 243: "We don't need social service workers where poverty is unknown" is absurd--$ won't buy a child's mental/emotional health anymore than happiness.  Heinlein fans (he's my favorite SF novelist) may find it historically/developmentally enlightening, but as fiction, it's his worst novel 
 This book did not keep my son's interest at all. He is 2. I was quite disappointed at this book. 
 If you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all.  He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.  His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon's Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70's as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books.  
 Although I was thrilled to see the entire Oz collection together at last, I was terribly disappointed with this edition.The print is too small and the book seems to be "all work and no play." I mean that it is so intent on getting the stories together that there is no time for little things that make children's books good, i.e. pictures. The binding is rather cheap looking and the page quality is see through.Save your money and buy a good hardcover collection 
 Hey, c'mon.  Whoever thought this book would be good for children is just saying that because it was illustrated by Sendak.  I got it in a group of books from a sale and I have 2 kids ages 3 and 5.  I am all for teaching about injustices and the plight of the homeless but it takes an adult with a masters degree to "appreciate"  the message and illustrations here.  Don't buy it for anyone under the age of 30 
 Q: Mr. President, in your speeches now, you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that? [...]  BUSH: ... I don't know where he is. Nor -- you know, I just don't spend that much time on him really, to be honest with you [...]  Q: Do you believe the threat that bin Laden posed won't truly be eliminated until he is found either dead of alive?  BUSH: As I say, we hadn't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure. And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.  I'll repeat what I said: I truly am not that concerned about him.    -President George W. Bush, March 13, 200 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 If you are familiar with modular knitting, this book offers nothing new.  The patterns didn't appeal to me at all;  there was no snap to the designs.  If you aren't familiar with modular knitting, there are better books from which to learn 
 I read a review in a local paper about The Mammoth Book of Humor and thought that it would make a wonderful Christmas gift for my in-laws.  The reviewer went into great detail about the hilarious section that lists typos and unintentional puns from actual newspaper headlines.  Unfortunately, they failed to mention that the book also contains religious humor that is in poor taste and that many people will find offensive 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 My son received this as a gift. The age range specified is actually too young to understand the concept that you can only squeeze the gas or brake hand control.  If both are squeezed at the same time, the fuse blows and then the thing doesn't go.  Try explaining this to a two year old. It's like patting your head and rubbing your tummy!! Of course we didn't have the right fuses on hand either, so the same day he received it, my son couldn't use as intended 
 This book had so many chances to develop thought-provoking story lines, but instead jumped out of a story as quickly as it was started.  The characters were quite bland, as many weren't even given a chance to be explored before the focus changed yet again.  This was an easy read in terms of the length, but a hard read due to boring storylines 
 Schneiderman's "Leonardo's Laptop" is singularly disappointing.  Promising to raise our expectation of what we should get from technology, he instead uses a forced extended metaphor in the form of Leonardo da Vinci.  What would Leonardo do?, we are repeatedly asked.  Schneiderman attempts to answer the question.  Sadly, his answers are neither new nor groundbreaking.  I cannot believe that Leonardo would simply recount solutions that are already available and attempt to make such solutions sound visionary and forward-thinking.  The chapters in the book discuss the issues with usability today, activites and relationships, and attempt to discuss future directions in several fields: government, healthcare, business, and education.  In these chapters, Schneiderman uses feel-good buzzwords like 'empowering' and 'enabling', but never moves beyond the feel-good buzzwords to suggest real solutions.  In most cases, he suggests solutions that are already implemented; in others, he simply waves his hands at the problem and says that there has to be a solution.  Each chapter concludes with a skeptic's corner.  This section could easily be re-labelled the strawman's corner.  In that section, he constructs arguments that skeptics might use, but he must assume that skeptics are uniformly moronic.  The so-called skeptical arguments are drawn with exceptionally rough strokes, which he dispenses of with little regard to very real concerns that can and should be discussed.    I had high hopes for this book.  I wanted something that pushed the boundaries.  I wanted something visionary.  Instead, I got a repetitive book that somehow didn't say anything.  I can only hope that future works give us something better than this.  
 I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year. I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.  Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...  No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend. Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids. 
 Its made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on. I'm afraid to put a heavy book on there, because I'm sure the parts will just snap off 
 I compliment the author for the amount of work put into this book and the attempt to represent shamanism. However, it is rather patronizing in its presentation 
 If you are new to linear algebra, (even if you took introductory course), don't buy this.  All those who took Linear Algebra course using this book got to hate the subject.  Cheap for the content?  Yes, of course.  Because the content is not good.  Not constructed well.  I'm relearning it using Schaum's Outline, which is good and now I understand what was written in this awful book 
 A book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.  As I read some sentimental  stories, and some down right boring stories I questioned how more than half  of these stories got into the `Country1 edition of the Chicken Soup series.   I loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the  other entries 
 Do not waste your money on this book. I was able ro read a friend's copy (which he paid $3 at a garage sale). This book was obviously done as a self-promotional tool.   Instead of buying this book, Google search the items in the table of contents which are provided for you by Amazon. You will gain a lot more knowledge than what is in this rag. What really gets me, is that he is charging a large amount of money for a book that has readily available information on the Internet.  If you want to waste $27, buy this book. Otherwise, do some basic research on the Internet and gain more knowledge than this book or its author has to offer 
 Although I agree with the many reviewers who found the sentiment expressed in this book to be poignant and comforting, I found this book disturbing.  The main canine character grows up from a puppy to become an extremely overweight dog.  Yet, there is no indication in the book that obesity is an avoidable condition or that it was detrimental to the dog's health to be overweight.  Obviously this book was not intended to be a book about proper animal care, I get that.  But if the author was not going to address the dog's obesity in any way, why was it such a prominent element in the story?  Inadvertently, the author sends the message to children that dogs get fat and we can't do anything about it.  As a person who works in animal welfare, I am uncomfortable with that message.   
 Apesar de las excelentes criticas cosechadas por Pearl, que presumía una lectura interesante y capaz de enganchar al lector, El Club Dante es un tocho soporifero que me ha sido impsible concluir. La lectura se convierte en un lento via crucis para el sufrido lector. El autor contaba con excelentes mimbres para haber hecho una novela fantástica o al menos entretenida y sin embargo, se ha marcado un engendro confuso y horroroso dificil de digerir. Me duele tener que dejar libros a la mitad pero mi tiempo es muy valioso y cuando tengo un rato libre delante de un libro quiero disfrutar no pasearme por el Inferno de Dante. 
 I had my machine for 6 weeks, I loved it! I didn't like the coffee pot - it was very light and I was so worried I'd break it, but it made good espresso and it was easy to use.  BUT...after 5 weeks I was having trouble getting it to pump the espresso.  I thought the filter was clogged, but it wouldn't even put out water without a filter.  So, I returned it.  The guy told me "we get a lot of these back".  Apparently, the pump had failed...after only 6 weeks 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because I generally enjoy Will Smith's movies. While there are some funny moments I found the plot unconvincing and the characters (very) two dimensional. Obviously this is meant to be a romantic comedy and I wasn't expecting any depth but this was supremely shallow. Hitch the date doctor supports inept men in finding their dream partner, all the while he himself has not recovered from a traumatic college romance, so guess what, he has commitment issues. Enter attractive journalist, who funnily enough also has commitment issues behaves in a totally neurotic fashion is incapable of adult conversation and because she has issues exposes Hitch as the date doctor in newsprint, using the time honoured phrase, people deserve the truth, come on.........it's not politics. Despite her behaving like a jilted teenager Hitch discovers his deep love for her, and you can't help thinking that you yourself would be running a mile in his place.  I sat there wondering whether it would get better and waiting for it to end, if you want romantic comedy you could do better with something like guess who, meet the fockers, prime, or even the "old classics" you've got mail or return to me. But give this one a miss 
 I feel like I was tricked in to buying this book.  It had 5 star reviews and I was looking for something good to read.  Once I started to read it became obvious this is a very mediocre book.  I went back and checked the reviews and they were all written by people who had never reviewed other books.  I suspect they were "planted" to promote the book.  Unfortunately this seems to happen quite often on Amazon. Fool me once...... 
 My friend started this book a month and a half ago and still hasn't finished it - and problably never will. It's hard to understand what it's about, the material is dry & unclear. According to her, reading it is torture 
 I purchased this phone and had it shipped directly to my elderly father in another state.  The description never indicated batteries were required and it did not come with batteries.  Had I known, I would have either ordered another phone or the batteries to go along with it.  Instead, the phone sat for 2 weeks waiting for one of Dad's caregivers to purchase batteries.  Dad swears it doesn't have a speakerphone option and since I haven't seen the phone, I have no idea if it's the correct phone.  If it does have the advertised speakerphone capabilities, they are not as well marked as the other "big buttons".  I'm disappointed 
 It's summed up on the back of the jacket:  "... a compendium of history's most ... fool notions, useless products ..." Substitute "publishing's" for "history's", and there you have it.  All of which begs the [next] question -- what was *I* thinking when idiotic enough to purchase this piece of slack-jawed trash?    
 Not what I was hoping for.  Too spacey "breaky" for me 
 Very limited use.  It seems to show weeds that basically look like flowers.  If you're looking for common back yard pest weeds, this isn't the book 
 This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin. 
 I ordered this DVD a full month before Christmas. I still don't have it. Can you reimburse me 
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH STEVE'S PERFORMANCE.  EVENTHOUGH IT TOOK A LOT OUT OF HIM TO REFRAIN FROM SWEARING, HIS MATERIAL TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW BEGAN TO DWINDLE TO THE POINT THAT IT JUST BECAME PLAIN IGNORANT, ESPECIALLY IN THE PART WHERE HE WAS EXPRESSING HOW HE WOULD "KILL SOMEONE", ETC., AND GLOATING BOUT IT.  AFTER I BOUGHT IT, I LATER CAUGHT IT ON A CABLE NETWORK.  GOD MAY NOT BE "THROUGH WITH HIM YET", BUT IT WILL BE UP TO HIM (STEVE) TO REPENT ON HIS OWN.  THIS MAY BE GOOD HUMOR FOR A MORE COMPLACENT CHRISTIAN AUDIENCE 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying 
 I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went. 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Adding to the previous negative reviews, how can one take seriously a book which, on page 2, cannot even get the location of Whitefield's birth correct? Stout makes him a son of Bristol instead of a son of Gloucester  (35  miles to the north). If he makes such a mistake this early what  confidence can one have in the rest of the book 
 Most people writing reviews for this DVD are focusing on the music and performances which I agree are great BUT unfortunately the DVD which I am reviewing was lousy. The editing was extremely ridiculous. You would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second. It was more like 5 per second (OK that may be a slight--VERY SLIGHT-- exaggeration). This a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree. Terrible! The images come at you like a machine gun. Please support this band by buying their CDs but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this DVD 
 The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery.  Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off. 
 Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorola's hardware was very good, but that their software left a lot to be desired.  Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan.  I had made the decision to switch to T-mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options.  Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Moto's software were right on the money.  There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone, not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way the phone book is designed.  Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone.    As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls.  The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before.  During the course of the last few months (the phone is less than a year old) I've also found that it has begun crashing.  A lot.  Opening or closing it will result in a "white screen of death."  Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging, that it is unable to charge and that it's SIM card cannot be found, after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off.  With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off.    At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk.  I am also forced to conclude that it isn't the only model which is.  None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone.  My wife's Motorola has shown its own host of problems.  People working for T-mobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never, ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone.  In fact I've had T-mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them, but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online.  So that's what I'm going to do.    Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night, restart it five or six times a day, and keep apologizing to my friends, family and employers for always missing their calls 
 This book is silly junk.  I find few redeeming qualities in it.  The events contain magic without making sense, and the story line leads to no relevation and a stupid conclusion.  It is a waste of money 
 This book does not do a good job in explaining the basic concepts of Statistics and how to apply it for quantitative analysis of Investments. The only reason why this book sells is that it is part of the recommended texts for the CFA program and the authors are part of the AIMR board. I am pursing the CFA charter as well as my masters in Economics and I would suggest the book "Introductory Statistics" by Thomas H. Wonnacott, Ronald J. Wonnacott which does an awesome job in explaining the basic concepts of Statistics. You would understand WHY we do such and such instead of memorizing formulae 
 This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically shound and the instruments are interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. I can't help but feel the singer is often off-key. If you don't like high whiney voices, you definetly don't want this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once 
 I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart 
 Writer's Digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers. The magazine ain't one of them, however.  For starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other Writer's Digest products. One you get past paying $19.95 a year for what's essentially a brochure, you'll notice that most of the articles don't apply to you. Most writers stick to one genre, yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction, poetry, business writing, editing, non-fiction, etc. If you're working on a biography of J. Edgar Hoover, do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings? I'll take "no" for $600, Alex.  So, now you're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant. Well, let's start chipping away at that:  The letters about grammar questions are a waste: if you have a question about affect versus effect, would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence? Thought so. (Furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions aren't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space, like I used to do when I was the news editor at my college paper.)  Writer's Digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers. My favorite was when it reviewed Microsoft Word. Thanks - I'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program. To be fair, some of the reviews are useful, although you can get better information just by looking up the product on Amazon.com and reading the reviews there.   If you're going to Writer's Digest for market information, you'd be better served elsewhere: the annual Writer's Market publication has all the markets and is more thorough, whilst the Writer's Market website has all that information and is up-to-date. Your money would be better spent on those two products.  About the only articles I have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded. There you have it: two or three pages an issue that are useful.  If you're trying to get your work published, Writer's Digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine: go with the annual Writer's Market book, the website, and pick up a style manual of your choosing (Chicago is the best). Don't waste your money on this magazine 
 Save your money. This book has almost no information in it. The book contains only pictures with few dates and some old prices which don't take into consideration the condition of the item. It is very incomplete. I have a dozen Wagner skillets and couldn't find any meaningful mention of them in this book. I wanted  to learn about the products that Wagner produced and when each series was manufactured. This book doesn't have any of that information in it. I hope I can find a book that does! Anybody want a used book for half off 
 I wasn't very much impressed with this book. It only had a few words per page and didn't offer anything to comfort. If you are grieving and looking for help I suggest finding a different book 
 If you want to checkout a good Jason Scott Lee film, I recommend the following:  Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story  Rapa Nui  "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is an awful film. Awful production values. Awful acting. Awful script. I would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances Asian American awareness in Hollywood (This film does neither.).  I would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. If you are curious, perhaps a rental from Netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.  If you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your Asian American film awareness, and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing. These are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of Asian American actors:  Better Luck Tomorrow   Mulan   
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 This book truely does not help much.  The problems at the end of the chapters do not have any answers in the back of the book, as do all others.  It is impossible to check your work until it is too late.  This book does not build from simpler to more complex.  It does the opposite, which only prolongs the learning process and makes it more difficult than it could be 
 With the X-Men feature films and the hit Ultimate X-Men comic opening the world of X-Men to new fans, X-Men: Evolution takes the established characters fans have loved for years (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Shadowcat) and puts them as high school students living at Professor Xavier's mansion with Wolverine and Storm as grown up instructors, and a new character named Spyke is introduced as well (whose powers are distinctly similar to that of Marrow, a former X-Men member in the comics).  Many longtime fans didn't find the series too likeable because of the way it is presented, and X-Men: Evolution doesn't hold a candle to the early 90's Fox show.  Nightcrawler's characterization is terrible, and there's too much teenie bopper type mellow drama going on with high school kids.  The animation is decent, but it's not as gritty as the Fox series.  The later seasons however, in which beloved characters Gambit and Colossus are introduced (and they do battle with Apocalypse), are much better than the episodes contained on these discs, but all in all I'd stick with the Fox series anyday 
 I saw the TV show made, so I wanted to check out the full story.  It was a disappointment, but my wife loved it. So there you are one against, one for it 
 I've been under the weather this weekend, and spent most of my time in bed. This sucked. However, my loving wife was kind enough to run to the library and grab some reading material, so at least I had that option.  Sadly, I spent a good portion of that time reading Beaujon's lackluster attempt at a definitive sample of Christian Rock.  Want the short capsule review? This book is weak sauce, written by someone not qualified to write such a work, and with an agenda to pound.  Now for the long review.  My biggest complaint with BPSML is that the whole premise is weak. That premise being "Let's take a contributing writer from Spin magazine (a magazine not known for its favorable view of Christian music) send him around to a few music festivals and see if he can figure out what makes those kooky Christians tick!"  That's hardly a compelling pitch for a book. Honestly, I don't know who would buy it. I doubt Christians are champing at the bit to hear yet again that the secular world distrusts and misunderstands them. Likewise, if you aren't already a fan of CCM, where's the motivation to read this? You aren't going to recognize any of the bands.  Secondly, Beaujon is not at all qualified to write this kind of work. At least not without doing research that he doesn't bother with. This is evident throughout the book is many ways two of the more glaring being his mistaking the parable of the Prodigal Son for the parable of the Good Samaritan. Hey, if you're going to be writing about artists using these stories as fuel for their music, don't you think you should know the difference?  One other way Beaujon shows his lack of qualifications to write this work is in his flawed insider's view of the music world. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that most music critics (critics in general for that matter) love to champion the exotic and outré, even if such work just simply sucks. I don't know why this phenomenon exists, but you can see it in any issue of Spin or Rolling Stone you pick up. Half-baked bands with bizarre sounds and near pornographic stage shows become media darlings, while quiet solid performers are ignored and languish in obscurity. How else to explain the overwhelming fame of Marilyn Manson, and the near anonymity of Michael Penn?  Beaujon brings this insider's prejudice to his take on Christian rock as well - lauding acts like Pedro the Lion for creative use of profanity, and reveling in tales of those CCM artists who have suffered personal moral setbacks. At times he seems almost giddy in his revelation that by golly, some of these Jesus Freaks smoke, drink and cuss! How novel!  Additionally Beaujon takes an almost hit and miss sample of Christian rock. Claiming bands that he likes are the "Big Show" and utterly ignoring those he doesn't appreciate. I'm sorry, but writing about Christian music and ignoring the excellent work of Steven Curtis Chapman, is like writing a history of secular rock, and neglecting to include at least a mention of Michael Jackson and Thriller. To make matters worse, the bands Beaujon chooses to see are predominantly part of the Jesus People movement, and play the Cornerstone festival. He hits a few acts from Tooth & Nail too. Good stuff to be sure, but far from a real sampling of Christian Rock.  The reader is thus left with a very one-sided view of CCM, and that view is flawed and filtered through Beaujon's own opinions. It appalled me to read Beaujon's high praise for Stryper (a mediocre hair metal band that had a few albums in 80's) immediately followed by his utter scorn for Petra. He even goes so far as to call Petra bereft of musical talent. Sorry Andrew, Petra's been around far too long to be dissed like that. They've earned their chops, and survived multiple shakeups in the band. Untalented? No. Might not be your cup of tea, but remember what we're talking about here, a Christian band performing stadium style rock anthems and power ballads. You can't really compare them to flavor of the moment groups like Mute Math. I defy anyone to compare Petra to Aerosmith and KISS and find them demonstrably less talented.  In Beaujon's defense, he admits that he interviewed the bands he did, because they were the few that would speak with him. Most act's publicists just dumped his call into limbo. It amuses me that he seems baffled by this behavior, touting secular acts outstanding availability to the press. Gee Andy, why would Christian artists be hesitant to be interviewed by a Spin writer? Could it be that they've done it before and been brutalized in the media? Could it be that they're used to being marginalized by the mainstream, and have no incentive to help promote your book? Could it be that your readers simply aren't their target audience/market, and they just plain don't need you?  Should these artists have been so wary? In a word - absolutely.  From the first word, Beaujon is pushing his agenda. He cleverly doesn't admit this until the afterword though. In fact, if you questioned him about it, I doubt he'd even realize that he was writing from a specific agenda. Simply put, Beaujon suffers from a malady that afflicts far too many people in this world. Once upon a time, someone who claimed to be a Christian hurt them, and as such, they tar all Christians with the same shady brush. In Beaujon's case, it was his father, a minister driven from his church after having an affair with a parishioner, then embezzling from the next church he went to. Do I feel sorry that Beaujon had to go through that as a child? Sure. That's a terrible thing for anyone to live through. Beaujon admits that this led him to question his faith and reject God.  Let me pause here to comment on this scenario. As I said, this type of thing happens far too often. The only response I can make is to say that first, Christians aren't perfect. And it wasn't Jesus that hurt you, just one of his followers.  With this type of baggage in his past, it's surprising that Beaujon is as fair as he manages. I was pleasantly surprised that he simply didn't conclude that CCM is a farce, and all believers are fools - hey, I've heard it before from better writers!  This bias proves out time and time again in BPSML. As I mentioned before, Beaujon takes an almost perverse glee in citing case after case of Christian rocker that stumbled in the game, and gave in to moral weakness. Amy Grant had a divorce and sunbathes nude! Sandy Patty had an affair! POD don't want to be called a Christian band! David Bazan doesn't even think he's a Christian anymore!  So what? These aren't cases unique to CCM. They happen all the time in all walks of life. What really seems to puzzle Beaujon is why the Christian rock community takes these cases so seriously. He scoffs at so called "morals clauses" in artist contracts that call for them to abstain from vice and immorality. Why is that such a bad idea? If the secular music world adopted such clauses, maybe there's be a few more Janis Joplins, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobains around?  He also sees no merit in record labels that try to help new acts fit into the CCM scene. He mocks the so-called "Jesus-per-minute" requirements many labels enforce. First off, I doubt such requirements can be boiled down to something as simplistic as a "Jesus-per-minute" or "no bad language" requirement. Secondly, again, why is this a problem? Doesn't it make sense far a label to shelter a new act a little? This is just professionalism in my opinion. For example, suppose I was appointed Surgeon General of the United States. In my first public address, I walk on stage in a Nazi uniform and give a speech about how "We're going to commit genocide on AIDS!" That kind of behavior is blatantly inappropriate for the job. So too would be a Christian band that wants to write songs that make no mention of spiritual truth, and consistently use profanity. Pedro the Lion ... I'm looking right at you.  I'll give Beaujon a few points. He nails the impact of Keith Green right on the head. He also does an excellent job denoting the impact of Steve Taylor. These are both artists that made a huge mark in the world of Christian rock, and Beaujon rightly spends ample time on both of them.  In summary though, I just can't recommend this book. If you're already a fan of CCM, picking up a few copies of CCM Magazine will give you a better overview of the genre. If you don't like CCM at all, why would you even read this book? Beaujon makes an attempt at being non-judgmental, but his own baggage and bias trip him up. He winds up writing a book that is neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm, and just like the Laodiceans in Revelation 3, I want to spew this mess of a book out of my mouth 
 This is a problem I've had for some time with Conor Oberst, front-man of Bright Eyes. He is undoubtedly, perhaps even unusually, talented as a young songwriter. At the age of 13, he was released his own debut album on cassette and had started his own record label with his brother. He had already released a sizable catalogue of work by the time he was 25, when "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" and "Digital Ash in a Digital Urn" were both released at the same time. It may be bizarre to release two separate albums at once, when they could've just as easily been packaged together in a double-album. This is the sort of abstract "cleverness" that I find slightly irritating.  "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning", a collection of guitar-based folk songs, is nearly the opposite of "Digital Ash in a Digital Urn", a more electronic, alternative-style album. The intention of releasing two separate albums appears to be to showcase Oberst's ability to make two entirely different styles of music. Oberst has been considered a "musical genius" and "prodigy" by many of his long-time fans and critics. I find that this is perhaps an over-estimate of his abilities. Yes, we already know that he's come out with a large quantity of music for his age. But, how much of it is good?  "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" is essentially a folksy, "story-telling" sort of album. The first song, "At The Bottom of Everything" opens with Oberst's narrative tale of a woman on an airplane about to crash into the ocean, before the music and lyrical part of the song actually starts. The rest of the songs are in the same vein, each telling a story through the lyrics and background music. Some fans have made comparisons between Oberst's style and Bob Dylan, which I don't think is fair. Bob Dylan, influential folk-song performer of the 60s, has an effortless style of song composition and a capability of writing songs of a variety of themes, including messages of political relevance. Oberst, on the other hand, is trying incredibly hard to really make something of himself. He often comes across as rather desperate to reach some sort of apex of musical genius, after which I suppose he assumes to be praised for his talent.  I don't think I'm even going to bother writing a review for "Digital Ash in a Digital Urn", because it's not really worth my time. "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" is better composed and contains greater amount of listenable songs than the other. There are times when his true talent becomes apparent, as in the well-crafted and catchy 'Another Travelin' Song', but many of the others come across as exceedingly forced and lacking in depth. He still has an huge amount of potential, but I don't think it will come through until he stops trying so hard to stun and amaze music-listeners with such feats as releasing two albums simultaneously (however lackluster they may be!). I find that it is the quality of the music that matters the most, not the volume of material produced 
 The problems people describe aren't the author's fault - I think. If someone did the ghostwriting, even with him dealing with the submitted manuscript, then shame on Mr. Kay, although his reputation would preclude this being a possibility.  I think the odds would be like the lottery - so this would be an anti-lottery.  As to the quality of the WROX books, something many people forget is WROX went belly up, despite the quality of their material. The assets & IP were picked up by Wiley in 2003 (http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-105072.html).  Most news doesn't mention the financial straits, just the purchase.  When Windows 3.1 came out in 1992, many asked "What's the best book(s) to buy?"  The general concensus was "Petzold (MS Press) and any of the following list...".  As web development has become the hot topic of the previous seven or eight years, specifically with the maturing of Microsoft's IIS/ASP, evolving into .NET.  O'Reilly has long been recognized in the *NIX market and has successfully branched into many other disciplines successfully.  Enough so that it's considered to be on the list of "This [O'Reilly] book and any of the following...", which may or may not be an O'Reilly book, but it's not a surprised if it is.  The familiar dense (weightwise), red book with author headshots (WROX) have a similiar standing with many developers, frequently expressed to be of good standing in recommendations to others.  Unless the critical personnel were transferred along with the purchase, then the relationship between Wiley (the new owner) and WROX authors at the hands-on level and the ability for the Wiley people to acclimate and maintain the habits, philosophies, and perspective of the WROX "style", then there will be misfires, such as we've seen in the two new Kay books.    Good authors are flexible but when it comes to computer books, the various types of editors have the ability to considerably alter the destiny of the content. This can be in terms of pre-submitted direction or changes made inhouse. On top of that, unless things have changed radically in the previous years, books are written on accelerated scheduled, edited, returned to the author for verification and only [hopefully] minor changes in response to queries from the various editors.  Once that manuscript is at the publisher, it's tough for external forces to change what will likely happen to the book.  Aside from software feature changes (e.g. in beta), the direction has been established and things move forward.  One would hope as X* continues to mature there will be another opportunity for the second edition of this book to overcome a first edition which should have been a complement to Kay's XSLT Programmer's Reference, a must-have item on the shelf of anyone who claims to work with XSLT.  Important enough, as I've said elsewhere, it's an interview question: what XSLT books do you have on your shelf?  If Kay is missing...then either the candidate is *so* good they don't need it (extremely rare) or their unfamiliar enough with what's going on in the real world (and real world resources) they are likely not to be at a level they should be and may need to be nudged into additional professional growth with the book.  Rating? **  As Clint Eastwood says in The Gauntlet, "I'll give her a two. But that's only because I've never seen a one."   In this case, we've seen a 4 1/2 or 5 star XSLT book unable to transfer its performance to an equally important sibling. The potential is there, the content is [mostly] there, the author is there, so it's better than nothing, or a lesser work from someone less qualified than Mr. Kay.  Because we've seen an extremely high quality product, we have to look at this with an critical & hesitant eye.  For those who feel they've been punk'd, particularly if they've had the book strongly recommended to them, more's the pity.  They're at a fork in the road, requiring a coin toss: keep the book for what's there or return it to the publisher with a few specific statements regarding your displeasure and what you expect. Otherwise, you're probably going to be presented with a choice of another WROX book (or a book from another publishing house within the Wily lineup).  If you want your money back, you're going to have to be firm about that.  Money going back out is money out of their pocket(s).  Keeping a customer happy, as opposed to pacifying soon to be ex-customer, regardless of what else is said or done is far less expensive and they feel it's a generous sign of good will 
 Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.  The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you.  I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.    If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere.  Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product.  The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.    As with many things, made in CHINA!  I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS!  
 The author argues that we Americans have been throwing our weight around.  And that we ought to embrace multilateralism and international law.  Well, that sounds really good.  Just what could be wrong with that?    The main problem is that even if we Americans have been unfair and unjust, there is little reason to believe that we'll be better off if we give more power to an international group.  Such a group could be united against us, and it could make things worse for everyone (and really bad for us Americans).  Probably, we'd be assured at the start of the group's good intentions.  But after we conceded enough power, we'd get double-crossed.  Well, there isn't too much chance of that!  The United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and others have made their intentions pretty clear.  And so does the author.  We're talking about a wolf in wolf's clothing.  I think one important issue the author deals with is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As he says, "On no issue is the gulf between America and the rest of the world greater than on" this.  Well, given that the issue is so important, what does Prestowitz say?    Well, he refuses to blame the Arab side for the failure of the Camp David negotiations.  And he says that Sharon's walk on the Temple Mount was about as bad an idea as one could have.  Okay, I have a few questions:  1)  If the Arab case has any merit, why is it promoted almost exclusively by terror and lies?  Does he think that such terror and lies ought to be opposed?  2)  Why does the author think it proper to ethnically cleanse Jews (but not Arabs) from the West Bank?  Isn't that a little arbitrary?  And why does the author think this injustice is essential to bring peace closer?  3)  Given that plenty of members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, why does the author think that a pre-approved visit by Sharon was so obviously a bad idea?  Has it occurred to him that refusing to let Sharon do something so ordinary might have severe ramifications in itself?  And just why is it that the author feels that a Jew visiting the holiest Jewish site, in the capital of Israel ought to be a casus belli?  Does this mean that the author thinks that Jews ought to be special in not having any rights in their own capital or at their own holy sites?  Oh yes, some folks have boasted that the author is a conservative.  But I'm judging his book on its merits, not on the author's purported politics.  In any case, I'm a liberal.  Had the author been more honest with us, I think I'd have been more willing to look at his advice.  As it stands, I think the one star I'm giving this book is generous 
 if your looking for something that you can rock to, like KMFDM, PIG, or slick idiot, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD! Musically it is way different then what i was hoping for. There is a variety of musical styles on here, non of which is good rockin industrial. So if you don't mind different, buy it, you'll like it, just don't expect much otherwise 
 I found this textbook to be utter garbage and a complete and confused mess.  Easily the worst text book out of my recent courses.(Campbell's Biology and Pasachoff's Physics are world's better.  I find it difficult to believe this is about as good of a book as an organic chem professor can write.  Very sad if this were true.)  A dearth of example problems make learning this far more difficult than it need to be.  This is made worse given the fact the problems for students at the end of the chapter don't build up bit by bit from earlier portions of the chapter until it ties it all together.  That's not even discussing just how few of these problems have any answer in the back of the book.(Since it's so easy to get a completely wrong but reasonable looking answer that's a big problem and pretty much means the solution manual has to be bought with it.  Almost seems like a scam to trick students out of over $200 by splitting the cost between two books.)  Also I get the impression that the authors have a crippling phobia of math and equations.(Just look at the end of chapter 7 where 2 pages of text could have been replaced by the equation for doing a SODAR calculation.)  Just utter garbage which isn't good given that organic is trying enough as it is 
 Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase.  
 Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not  baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is  exciting . 
 Painfully bad.  I want my money back.  Listen to Bob's albums, but stay far away from this movie.  So many great actors, but the story is nonsense.  The characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes.  Unnatural dialogue.  Poorly lit.  Poorly directed.  Poorly edited.  And Bob couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  Stone-faced, frail, semi-catatonic; completely devoid of charisma.  It's his vanity project, but he comes off looking ridiculous.  Even his musical performances are only so-so.  The movie was shot entirely inside a Hollywood studio (except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown LA), making it look fake and crowded.  A case in point: Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.  Amazing together in The Big Lebowski.  Both appear here as flat, irritating, one-dimensional characters.    It's a bummer, man 
 This book contained much of the same information as some of the other books, however it was not as easy to read.  I enjoy the books that are more colorful, have graphs and pictures, as well as testimonials.  This book lacked in those areas 
 I had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course...unfortunately, the instructor never even flipped through it.  It is by far the WORST photography book, really the worst book I have ever purchased!  There are typo's, the "example photos" and instruction sometime are not the same.  The projects are lame and really teach nothing.  I would not recommend this book under any circumstances...AVOID AT ALL COST!!! [... 
 Purchase this book (used, if possible), tear out the title page, then give the book to a friend and pay her to read it. Once she's slogged through it, ask her to estimate the year of its writing. Few readers will venture guesses much past 1985.   One suspects that this laughably reactionary manuscript was a long time in the peddling. However, with its call for a return to art as "a source of aesthetic delectation and spiritual refreshment," it is such fun to read aloud at parties.  In plodding prose with serrated edges, Kimball is nostalgic for a time that never was in his fetishes for "decorum," "civility," and "modesty," all "dandy" virtues that he positions as antipodal to intellectual activity or interpretation of any kind. This book paints a picture of a world of art that is, at its best, reassuringly literal, neatly narrative, and, after all, decorative.   In a muddled battle of authorial intent vs. contemporary art historical scholarship, The Rape of the Masters encourages the reader to return to the tiny chairs, soft tones, and primary colors of a preschool classroom, where everything was what it was, and the teacher was awful pretty. It was so much simpler then. 
 Standout tracks: EARLY, LAND BREAD&HOUSING, FOR YOU, CONFIDENTIAL(one deep song), 5 ELEMENTS(that beat is crazy!), TOO SMART(another deep song) Filler: Love you cant borrow(neo soul to the core), Gunslinger(garbage showtune record that brings the album down a couple of stars), Been through, Dont put down your flag(dull song even duller beat), The beat etc. Comrades call would have been a standout track if Styles P wasnt rapping offbeat. Bottom line: This is not the best effort M-1 can give you. There is not many gems in the music and it almost feels like a pop album even though its not. Its almost as if M-1 dumbed himself down for some record sales and thats not a good thing for a talented artist like him. You should never stoop to the likes of these pop culture fanatics especially when you're on a higher level than them. One last note I hope he never makes another record like the horrible gunslinger or I'll be forced to give up on him! 
 The 1999 Edition was great for the first couple of years, but it is time for a new one now. This one is now antiquated.  It's been 4 years now and we would like the 4th Edition ASAP.  Let's go Carl and don't let the JV book take away all the light from the Varsity team's book  
 When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store 
 This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly.  Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it.  
 Jay Kordich "the juiceman" is the bat s^%t crazy guy from the infomercials!! In fact, it is quit frightening how he is always yelling (probably to be heard over his juicer).  My question is why drink the concentrated fructose that is in juice when you can just eat the fruit and get all the fiber and  "flavinoids" and whatnot without drinking concentrated forms of sugar.  Juicing is  dead, eating right is the way to go, and by the way, a greasy burger once in a while is great too 
 I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as "the" book on this master director for way too long.   I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock.  Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book.  Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago.  The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.  This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature.  There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait.  Seek them out .. 
 We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again. 
 I have read many of N.B.'s novels and essays, and he is a favorite author of mine.  This novel, however, seems more like it was written by someone else in his writing style, rather than written by Baker himself.  It lacks the substantive punch of his earlier works, lacks the beauty and emotion of a narrator relating to others in his world.  The pet duck in the story seems more real, compelling, and finely drawn than the narrator's wife and children.  (Maybe this is intentional?)  In addition, whereas past Baker narrators have described the minutiae of their lives with freshness and wonder, this narrator gets pedantic.  Does the reader really need to be told how a rear-window defroster works, or how to wash a dish?  I think for Baker fans, this might be a disappointment.  For a first-time Baker reader, however, it's a peaceful little book that might lead to his better ones.   
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 Very comprehensive in terms of actor and crew bios and production trivia, but very thin on theory and discussions about the social/thematic/character underpinnings of the genre and the films that made it so great. I was hoping for more of the author's thoughts on those sorts of things than lists of little known facts about cast and crew and so on. 
 I have bought a few books on boudoir photography and this was disappointing.  When I see a book, I want to see pictures that I can aspire to.  These photos look, for the most part, like pictures anybody would snap of their girlfriend or wife without regard to background, lighting or any type of effects.  I would recommend "Garage Glamour" as a book for those of us trying to get better at boudoir photgraphy 
 While the Everio will work on a Mac, it is with JVC's movie program.  It is not iMovie ready.  There is a very strange "work around" involving DVDrop that will make it work.  Not very pleased with what I feel is misleading information about compatibility with Mac 
 I was disappointed that you need special disks, but even after that, the printing is mediocre, just below standards that is should be. The software is not that user friendly, frankly might as well stick with the black magic markers, for the money spent, a true dissapointment. 
 I read other reviews in search of the best song of the movie but not on the soundtrack and I did some searching and found the CD but it's not on Amazon anymore although the page is still up, the name of the CD is "Peines De Maures / Arc-En-Ciel Pour Daltoniens [IMPORT]"by La Caution. You can probably buy it on ebay  or your local underground music store. 
 These are more like 200-250 thread count. Soft at first, but after a couple of washings, they feel rough, loose their shape, and wrinkle easily. I purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment.  
 I personally hate it when songs are printed in different keys from the original recording, or they are printed in an abridged form. This is the case with this volume from the under appreciated Sondheim show "anyone  can whistle". Not only are the above mentioned problems present, but  one of the best songs (See what it gets you) is given a slow blues tempo  that just doesn't compare to the manic tone of the original. Granted, the  shows most famous song (there won't be trumpets) is included, but again, it  is in the wrong key and some of the lyrics are wrong. The mayoress' (played  by Angela Lansbury and Madeline Kahn) song "Iv'e got you to lean  on" (another toe tapper) is also presented abridged and in the wrong  key. Abd the lovely duet "with so little to be sure of" is  presented here as a solo, with the wonderful counterpoint female part  ommitted.  it is a shame that this show wasn't given a better treatmen 
 Although the book has some interesting material, it in not a satisfactory book on Tantra. White has not approached the subject with sufficient humility, and he has gotten carried away by his ideological positions 
 Let me start out by saying that I am a great admirer of Richard Dawkins. I find his work, especially 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Extended Phenotype' to be extremely enlightening and a joy to read.   Sadly, in this book Dawkins largely repeats himself and at the same type manages to down-scale his arguments for less capable readers.   In short, if you've read other works by Dawkins and have a healthy dose of scientific education this book will often be boring.  I highly reccomend 'The Selfish Gene 
 2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways 
 This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.  Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's "pet" squirrel escape his pants to the "bathroom" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call "toilet-bowl humor." Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call "amiable," "heart-warming," or even "cute"; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe "artist" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a "special edition" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing 
 I'm a John Case fan and this one was a real disappointment. I liked the Genesis Code so much I read it twice, and the others were very readable too, but this one just became way too unbelievable to be enjoyed. The story was contrived and the main character a little too stupid. Sorry - this one made me think twice about running out to get the next one 
 When i Was younger, i was an avid Britney Lover so it is no suprise that for my past birthday, i recieved 2 copies of "Greatest Hits" from my extended family.  I was unsure of what to do with 2 so i gave one to my ex boyfriend who is obsessed with her.  I must say, i am very upset first of all about the cd cover!  I am ok with retouching photos, or enhancing, but this is just to extreme.  Even when briteny was younger and more fit, she never had such a small "tight" body.  OK, now that thats said, i have to say, this cd is nothing to exciting for me since i already own all her previous cds.  What really annoys me (besides the fake brit body) is that overprotected was not the original buy some remix! That totaly turned me off.  Another thing is that My prerogative is now my favorite songs of hers' ever, so the entire cd is worth picking up just for that single.  I dont recommend this cd, just get the single off itunes (or whatever illegal file sharing program you get your music from) and save your self the money.  Nothing special here except the pop music we all are starting to get used to.  THis is no timeless in my opinion, i hope her new cd, (2007) will be artistically different and mature otherwise my girl britney will disapear into pop culture history 
 I found the messages this book attempted to convey indulgent, sexist, and to quote Francine chauvinistic. The idea of people being locked in a gender for an eternity seems to me a bit restrictive not to mention the rather earthly marriage rituals (waiting for the men to initiate the process of eternal union). I am not even going to go into the counsel of elders comprised of only male spirits. And tough luck for you introverts, obviously you have not evolved to the level of your extroverted counterparts. While I like to read intelligently written books about dimensions other than the one we live in, I found that even for a fantasy book this was lacking imagination. Perhaps Francine would do well to stick to her parties, it seems that they very much color her worldview. This book made me feel sad, angry and gullible for buying it. It was my first book from this author and needless to say my last 
 Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a generation. Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council "Monkeys" and "troglodytes", had an interesting earlier career.    He was disqualified from the student government election in  his Beverly Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits. He took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and longtime republican insider Grover Norquist.    But more relevant to this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality.  During this period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority Afrikkaner government. The hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune, as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid.  An amazing historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america, and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line.  My advice, buy it used for historical purposes, not new.  This guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the American people.   Let's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style abuses of civil rights,  and many other crimes against humanity.  Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the USA.  Let this movie be a record of the power of Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth.  Let's make a different legacy this time around 
 Now this is how art should be done. I love that a 13 year old can do what famous artists think they can do just because hey are famous. She has as much, if not more talent than an artist educated in Paris 
 I picked up this book hoping to find really a good academic telling of the fables.  Instead, I find a poorly written book full of grammatical errors.  Plus, I think there is definitely something lost in the translation of the original fables as most of the "morals" make no sense in relation to the story.  The introduction to the book, which really could have used a good editor, is very wishy washy about saying anything definitive as to the origins of these fables.  The notes attached after some of the fables shed very little if any light on the meaning of the fable or the symbolism used.  I get the feeling that the the Temple's got bored with their subject matter and just threw something together to be done with it.  There has to be a better translation of the source material out there.  
 This album is unlistenable for one specific reason: backing singers. Is it "The Watson Twins"? If so, Jenny needs to AXE THEM. Seriously, the only GOOD tracks are those which feature JENNY ONLY (title track; "It Wasn't Me"). The rest is awful, overproduced studio glop 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 I have read many (too many) historical romances in my time, and I very much enjoy a well written "sex" scene. I actually threw this book down in disgust, about 100 pages before the end, because I knew EXACTLY what was coming next: a repeat of the same tired old sex scenes for the sake of more sex scenes. No decent plot, not one iota of believable storyline...I  threw this book in the trash can...and it was new 
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
 A very disappointing book filled with many outdated pictures from magazines years ago.  Lacking anything new and inspirational 
 The castle is cheaply made and comes with so few accesories worthy of mention and without the types of accessories that would make it something fun to play with.  My daughter has hardly even played with hers, with the exception of opening and closing the castle just to hear the sound!  She also noticed on her own that the apecial "wand" used to open the castle was not like the one in the adverstisement...."Mommy, there's no crystal on my wand, look!"  Also, the dance floor so weak it's nearly impossible for my 5 year old to even manuever.  A definite disappointment for the $ 
 I received this book for Christmas from my sister, who shares my enjoyment of cooking.  As I eagerly began reading it, I realized that it consisted of a series of anecdotes, all related to women being oppressed by men, by society, by whatever.  But the common theme was that women were oppressed, and then...women were oppressed, and then again...women were oppressed, and oh, by the way, did the author mention that women were oppressed?  Sigh.  This is a story that deserves telling, not one that deserves to be hijacked by a woman with a cause 
 I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.  On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time.  The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out 
 I wasn't the actual store it was the play. I put it in the garage somewhere. I wanted the actual book! Why didn't it say it was the play? I didn't even read it!!!!   pattydoone@sbcglobal.ne 
 Choice of words, writing style and teaching of biology is NOT satisfactory in this book.  Not a good way to learn CELL bio, maybe functional at higher levels but definitely not useful in explaining new concepts.  Occassionally the sentences do not even seem properly formed. i.e. fragments and more often ultra-run on sentences with no structure and no clarity.  Frustration - the emotion experienced while reading this book.   
 This is my second time to purchase this terrific reference book.  I have loaned it out so many times that I can remember where my original copy is!!  The rotary cutting directions are clear and accurate.  
 I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest 
 Upon the brief trailers and DVD cover that gave me the visuals of this show, I thought I would really enjoy it. It was set 20 years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion (later in the series) the Mets (Led by such greats as Lenny Dykstra and Daryl Strawberry) beating the Red Sox (Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, to name a few) in that world series. The error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports.  That, however, is in the foreground, much like the Yankee's world series was (led by Reggie Jackson's heroic and never ending home run hits) in the movie "Son of Sam" serial killing spree of Sam Berkowitz in NYC in the 1970's.  At first glance, I thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion, all the way down to the end when Bill Buckner misses the easy grounder to first base. What we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives, tie it all together, and have some meaning come out of it. The result is what I should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays: Dull, Boring, spinning wheels that get stuck, continue to spin, and lead nowhere. There is nothing poignant, profound, or purposeful with the script of this movie, and if there is, I guess I was to wrapped up in watching the Red Sox let another one slip away.  First off, we have a decent cast to say the least: Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., and Catherine O'hara (Home Alone fame) are all actors who have shined in the past and though aren't so much of household names anymore, can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits.  The problem is not them. The problem is the script! Michael Keaton is a man about to go through a divorce. His daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman (remember, this is 1986, not 2006) and he's seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes. It doesn't seem to bother him much though, as the character Keaton plays (Nicky Rogan) is a famous playwright in the Big Apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else. The camera is always showing the cabbies ID cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the Middle East. STRIKE ONE: This little display doesn't seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film, and seems not only unnecessary, but also ultimately ANNOYING after about the fourth cab ride. Rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he's not sure how it's going to be perceived by the masses. STRIKE TWO: Despite all the things outside Rogan saying he's supposed to be worried, scared, or bothered, he doesn't really come across that way. If anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion, feeling, or personality.  He is supposed to be nervous because critic David Schwimmer (Downey Jr.) is going to be the major reviewer of his new play. Schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of Syd Barret (see: Pink Floyd founder/drugs/gone crazy supposedly/left band/becomes artistic recluse) in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he's had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery. STRIKE THREE: This entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground, including a standoff with Rogan in Schwimmer's apartment with Rogan's teen daughter half naked on the couch, it just doesn't fly. By this time in the movie I'm saying I don't really care.  I'm going to give them one more chance at bat...STRIKE FOUR!: At one point in the movie, Rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety. Okay I'm thinking there will be some Bernard Goetz (see: Bernard Goetz/weird engineer/NY resident/4 would be robbers on subway/Goetz shoots them/becomes cult icon/hero/crazy dude for self defense and gun ownership) type situation brewing. The gun is fired off in Schwimmer's apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt (thankfully, I mean I didn't REALLY want anyone to get hurt). After that (I'll call a BALL ONE! here) Schwimmer and Rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize: They both are Boston natives, and HUGE Red Sox fans.  Rogan's mistress, who happens to be funding his new play, and Rogan's father, who is in ailing health and Rogan visits now and again, make Guest appearances. There are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned Red Sox bond come into play, but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning. Sure, the fat lady isn't singing yet, but like they said in the special features part of the DVD; The world series wasn't technically over for the Sox in that game, as the loss forced it to game seven in which the Mets ultimately won, but it didn't matter. Every fan knew it was a done deal, despite the hope.  In the end Rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her (nope, this time its actually someone not from the middle east) to go to a bar and watch the game. The actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan, though I still feel bad for Buckner, and all the BOSOX fans, when that ball went through his glove and the Mets scored the winning run as a result.  Special Features: In trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film, I learned that there were basically two ideas (1986 world series & Playwright vs. Critic showdown) that were eventually melded into one. Although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film, its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs. critic storyline is way to loose. It never really comes across strong and again, with the exception of the BOSOX tie between the two men, the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that don't hold up well at all. I understand its an "unconventional film" but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film.  In the end, this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when Buckner missed that ball. It's to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better.  Oh yeah, I gave it an extra "strike", and its still here. Sorry, you are outta here! Game OVER! See you on the "Field of Dreams" someday in rerun land. 
 Thanks for pointing that out dullbot. I thought I was the only one who noticed Riddlebarger and his peers spend more time disproving "Strawman" theology that proving their own.  Anyone thinking of buying this book do your homework first by reading Riddlebarger's blog at kimriddlebarger.squarespace.com, you may find his thesis "Riddled" with errors 
 There is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed.  There is no way to get out the wrinkles, other than by ironing them.  Otherwise, they are fine.  But who in the world wants wrinkled sheets!  You should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet.  These sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed.  I cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line 
 The size of this item is not diameter, its the length of the handle to the end of the tip on the strainer. the diameter is 3-4 inches. But I guess it would strain rather well 
 I have to agree with another review I just read here. The quality seems to be good, but it's just too small for any big screen. Ours is a 42" Philips Ambilight 42PF9631/37. The description here says the wall-mount is for 22-49", but the manufacturer does not agree with that. On the box and in the manual it says 23-46". Don't believe that either. It's only just over 16" wide, so there's just no way. It's also not going to work well if your studs are more than 16" (for example 24") apart. I'm also disappointed by the service of Peerless, because I emailed them the story above 2 weeks ago and I never got any reaction. This one is going back to Amazon. We bought a Sanus now, which seems to be perfect and not that much more expensive here at Amazon, while it costs about double elsewhere. Tip: Check your manual thoroughly and see if it mentions anything about VESA 
 Initially intrigued with this book, I quickly lost interest.  It starts out well but then degenerates into a bunch of random points which the author tries to use to argue his hypothesis that the universe was designed to give rise to intelligent life as a final outcome.  The blurbs along the margin were major distractions & made it hard to stay focused on the actual material in the book.  The book just kind of wanders around the various fields of science trying to find evidence to support the author's premise and then ends with the pronouncement that we're the peak of creation (very Genesis-like).  I'd have to pronounce this book mildly interesting if you can wade through the claptrap and the biased agenda 
 As a 26 year old bride to be I did not relate to anything in this book.  I didn't even finish it.  She gave great advice with reminding her readers to say "I love you" everyday to thier spouse- but besides that I didn't really know what she was talking about.  I could see the emotions surfacing in individuals who were maybe a little older- not to offend- but thoes that had been on their own for a long time before getting married.  I was dissapointed. 
 This books is at least 90% a waste of the reader's time and money! If you want to learn techinal analysis, indicators and money managment, read Dr. Elder's; and if you want something on psychology, read Mark Douglas.  This book is a perfect example of someone who does NOT trade trying to make himself appear as an expert in order to sell his books and seminars 
 At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac.  Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot 
 Jonathan Conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner. Jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff, you can't fool them twice. I know we will all be seeing Jonathan Product on the clearence rack in a Big Lots with in a year or two 
 I read this book, mainly because of good reviews it received.  1) How dissapointed I was, after finally reading it. Althought this book contains some useful information, it's still a headache to read it. All information is chaotic, badly organized and after reading 150 pages all you get is a headache. The second part of the book contains much more useful information than first. But still, the worst thing is organization of the information - how can write you about film formats, sound advise & meals for crew all on the same page?! This is really annoying & confusing!!!  2) Forget about DIGITAL: this book barely touches that topic. No advise regaring equipment, hardware or software.  3) 50% of advise given is something that every kid with a camera can come up with.  4) The authors often go too deep into details, forgetting about explaining elementary basics.  5) Advise they give is too often 'look-how-cool-we-did-it' instead of at least mentioning how does it work in real world and how professionals do it.  If you're a first-timer go for 'A rebel without a crew' by R.Rodriguez...  If want some professional advise buy 'From Reel to Deal' instead 
 This movie had a big impact on me. I attempted suicide two times after I watched this, because I know I was headed for prison for a crime I did not commit.So much for the positive impact. This proves the prison system completely fails as a correctional facility.The students or convicts should get no praise, what so ever,for this trash. 
 Sam is shocked when her husband decides he wants to divorce, even though she knew they had been growing apart for some time.  The news crushes her, and she deals with it by going to Tiffany's and spending $12,00.00 on things she doesn't really want.  Her husband's response is mild exasperation and a warning that he's moved most of the money out of the checking account where it will be safe.  Are you kidding me?  Are these supposed to be real people acting this way?  What follows is a series of events of unbelievable good luck as Sam alternates between feeling sorry for herself and acting absolutely crazy in a quest to be the perfect housewife and mother. A good example of the latter is when she cooks an entire Thanksgiving dinner, including a twenty-one pound turkey and several pies, although she is spending the day entirely alone.  Despite her erratic behavior, Sam manages to find the perfect woman to move in with her--a grandmotherly woman who helps her recover from her heartache.  Sam also begins a series of temp jobs and meets a brilliant and sweet man who loves her enough to totally change himself for her.  Throughout everything, Sam's husband continues to support her financially.  They don't fight over their son and her husband is even tolerant of Sam's crazy phone calls.  If this is what divorced life is like, I'm surprised more women don't go for it.   
 Described as, "loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin," The Rose would be much more entertaining if the film makers had gotten the rights to Joplins songs.  Bette Midler does an incredible job of re-creating a life of turmoil through the eyes of a sixties rock diva. An exhausted, burned out alcoholic who begs her promoter/manager (played by Alan Bates,) to give her a year off to rest, "The Rose," is on the path of destruction.  When she hooks up with an AWOL Vietnam War Veteran, you find yourself hoping he can calm her down enough to save her, but of course, you know that won't happen.  Much of the movie is actual concert footage of Midler singing her heart out, doing "Janis Joplin like," tunes, but again, this movie misses something by not using the real stuff.  And, as well as Midler belts out the songs, she sounds like Bette Midler singing 60's rock anthems and bluesy ballads; she doesn't sound like Janis Joplin at all.  Of course, Bette Midler doesn't look anything like Joplin, either.  Midler is a red-headed Jewish girl and Joplin was a bushy haired brunette from Port Charles, LA.  So, there are no physical similarities whatsoever between the real Janis Joplin and "The Rose."  The movie is somewhat dated by now, and I for one would like to see a newer, more accurate version being released for todays audiences.    
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 As one who had great success with the Atkins diet, I would say without reservation that such success is possible if one follows the programme exactly as it is outlined in the original New Diet Revolution, to which I'd give six stars if I could. The Induction period (first two weeks) is explained in depth in that book, and there is no need for a separate book to advertise products. In fact, the products are not only unnecessary (or no longer manufactured), but could sabotage the Induction period 
 More Than Human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.  The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works.  Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.  I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others.  So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since.  This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.  In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)  Bottom Line:  I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  These are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests 
 I guess I was hoping for more about the company and people. This book has lots of pictures and ads with some discriptions of the guns. It's not what I thought I was getting, the title should be changed to a "Pictorial of The First 100 yeras of Daisy Guns" 
 I read the book because I had heard good things about it.  I was disgusted by what I saw.  I've always been a moderate, so this is not the ramblings of some right wing nut who just hates liberals.  Ted Rall hates America with an almost satanic passion.  After reading the book, I went online and searched for Ted Rall's cartoons.  These cartoons are even worse than the book.  He advocates the deaths of our soldiers and makes one cartoon actually claimed that ALL soldiers are rapists and sadists.  Ted Rall is a sick and twisted human being.  Do not send any of your money to this sadistic and anti-american nut 
 This is another of the endless type of Hollywood movie that is lame, puerile, and stupid. I won't go into detail with examples of the lame attempts at humor, since other reviews here cover that well. And sure, as the the cover suggests, it's got a bunch of sexy babes in it, but don't watch it for them either, because there's very little to see of them. The only decent sexy scene is a hot tub one with several topless girls that runs maybe 2 minutes. Further, the cover advertises "4 UNRATED deleted scenes" as though those are sexy scenes, but they're NOT at all. So, if you're looking for very corny, adolescent humor, this film may be for you, but otherwise avoid it like the plague 
 The author of this book openly avows that he isn't a historian, but something tells me I would have known even if he hadn't.  This book is dotted with many examples of practices that would make anyone even vaguely interested in accurate history cringe.  For example, Shirazi describes the Scythians/Sakas as being "pagans who held their women in common and devoured their aged relatives" on page 85.  However, he neglects to note that because the Scythians had no writing of their own, the only accounts of them we have were written by the Greeks and the Persians - i.e. their bitter enemies who probably weren't particularly interested in scholarly objectivity.  He also tends to make rather large omissions, one example being the complete lack of reference to Shah Ismail's brutal campaign of forcing the public to convert from Sunnism to Shi'ism in the chapter on the Safavid Empire.  Last but not least, he has an irritating tendency to make embarrassing factual errors, a few of which I'll list:  - Page 64: Referring to Cyrus the Great as Cyrus III when he was actually Cyrus II - Page 88: Reference to the assassination of Julius Caesar at the hands of Octavius and Cassius rather than Brutus and Cassius - Page 203: Calling Ahmad Pasha "the Turk Emperor," despite that he was only a military officer and later a governor and despite that the very title pasha indicates that he was a government functionary, not a sultan - Page 216: Reference to how "Thomas Jefferson along with other scholars drew up the [U.S.] Constitution" despite Jefferson's being in France at the time and thus obviously not well placed to attend a constitutional convention in Philadelphia  There are other claims that seem questionable, such as the assertion on page 188 that the Ottoman sultan Selim I massacred 40,000 Shi'ites for which I have yet to find any corroborating sources.  However, those I listed above were enough to make me suspect every fact this book offered.    I suppose one can argue that this proves the superior instructive ability of the book (the process of running to the internet every five minutes to crosscheck a claim did ensure the subject matter was drilled into my memory), but this is hardly what constitutes an undisputed authority on the subject.  Of course, the book does have one undisputable edge over other histories of Iran: it's in English (albeit rather bad English).  However, if the reader wants a history that doesn't require constantly being on the alert for inaccuracies, this is not the place to look 
 It's been about 7 or so years as far as I can remember since I last saw South Park, and I have to say, I just remember it being more funny.  This movie was unbearably lame.  On the tv shows, there are actually some witty lines.  I just sat through this movie listening to stupid songs that weren't even funny, just the "shock value" of watching cartoons curse.  The curses weren't even funny, either ... just sort of stupid 'baby talk' type profanity; what is an "Uncle F&%*er" anyways?  I have to conclude that Stone and Parker are two of the most overrated guys out there.  Team America World Police just sort of drifted around with again, the novelty of puppets cursing.  And while I rented this film hoping to just have some stupid fun like I did years ago watching South Park on tv, it was a real disappointment.  Who cares about the cursing?  That's not what put me off.  It was just not funny 
 I bought this book because I'm trying to get OS X to use a NFS mount off of a FreeBSD server - amongst other things.  (Unix gurus will understand the irony of this seeing as how Apple OS X is based on FreeBSD - hello Jordan).  Well, the book falls far short of allowing me to do this.  What it does explain is great, unfortunately it fails to hit the spot in a number of key respects.  Lots of the things that can't be done from the GUI are also not possible from the command line after reading this book.  Just consider this, a unix instruction book that doesn't tell you how to mount a NFS export from a unix host - get real.  This means that the only network resources you can join after reading this book are Microsoft ones - which does somehow defeat the object of buying a PC that doesn't run Windows.  Oh and you can connect to MS networks' shares from the GUI without this book.  Not very impressed . .  
 The lack of Liam neeson and raimi's directing is what ruined this movie for me. While Mr. Vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the Liam created character and mr. Drake always has appeal, the movie as a whole needed a much better script. It was too predicatble, too phoney. On the bonus side, they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments Darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact, so that was a plus 
 This second book in the series is such a repeat of the first one I thought I may have mixed things up. I hadn't and except for a few changes I really felt it was a reread. Still sweet, but lets have some interaction with previous characters or something to mix things up a little 
 It's a very nicely drawn & explained book but if you have any other style home other than Victorian, there are limited styles that would match. Also, you have to order patterns separately 
 THOU SHALT NOT was a disappointing show because the source material (THERESE RAQUIN) has the potential to be a powerful musical.  Harry Connick Jr. penned the words and music for this show, yet it seems he has never studied some of the Broadway classics (from OKLAHOMA! thru RAGTIME) to learn how to use songs to develop character and advance the story.  He has come up with some great tunes here, but rarely do they seem to have much in common with the tragic story.  One notable exception is "The Other Hours" which is perfectly suited to the moment.  "Take her to the Mardi Gras" is a geat up-tempo dance number, but much of the rest plays like a collection of songs rater than numbers which are part of an integrated story.  Connick says he hopes to continue to work on Broadway and as I write this in March 2006 he is starring in a smash-hit revival of PAJAMA GAME.  Broadway can certainly use a composer of his talent, and we can only hope that he learns how to weave story and character into his songs for a future musical.  The cast on this CD is first-rate: Nobert Leo Butz, Craig Bierko, Kate Levering, Debra Monk are all fine. The CD is well-produced but the booklet contains only the lyrics and no notes about the show or a synopsis. Also no label or catalogue number. It seems to be a private release.  Copies were sent to Tony voters when the score was nominated (it lost to URINETOWN)and then with little fanfare the CD started showing up on Amazon and other web-retailers and in speciatly shops like New York's Footlight Records, but it has never been given general distribution.  Was this prduction jinxed? Previews had to be delayed a week because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Opening night Craig Bierko was accidently hit in the throat durring a fight scene and was out of the show for 2 weeks.  Kate Levering spained an ankle and was also forced out of the show for a  spell.  Maybe the ghost of Camille Raquin is more powerful than we thought 
 If you are a picky mom like me...i.e you DO NOT let your child watch "sponge bob" or "Scooby Doo" and you maybe even read Mothering Magazine, DO NOT get this book. I didn't feel the jokes were appropriate, I guess I am a bit of a nerd about these things. It isn't funny to have a headless man poor beer/ale down the "hole" in his neck. They discussed murdering Shrek (hey leap pad, not age appropriate!!!!), and I didn't like to see "human" Shrek in chains fighting to get free (nor did my son). They have "ugly" phrases that could have been more kid friendly, my son pointed out the ugly phrases, and snarled his nose at them saying "Mom, that was UGLY!". I was dissappointed with this book, and I am taking mine back to the store. I really like the leap frog system, even though I don't normally buy toys that require batteries...i.e the toys do something for the kid, instead I normally buy "old fashioned" natural toys where my son has to make the toys do stuff (blocks, leggos etc) BUT I REALLY love this system. It is a treat for my son to have an electronic toy so he really gets into Playing it and of course "accidently" learning. I also didn't like the Hop on Pop leap book for similar reasons, even though the Dr. Suess part was great, the leap pad people added unneeded "ugly" phrases again that were just NOT age appropriate. Although I did like the minimal writing on most of the Dr. Suess pages. I do like the regular "Leap" ones...moss lake etc, and the honey pot one with pooh bear. Sorry to be so picky, if you are not picky you will probly like this book.  
 We have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough.  The double has the same issues; it's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind 
 This is a *partial* copy of the Mathworld material online at the Wolfram Research web site.   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/  It makes for a decent mathematical enclopedia, but there are many others around, which should be purchased instead - look on Amazon for reviews.   To most reasonable peoples thinking, CRC should not be allowed to make any money on this particular book.   The FAQ on the Wolfram Research web site  "Q: May I host a mirror site or create a personal mirror? A: No. The material on this site is updated frequently, and so any mirror would rapidly become out-of-date ...."  So if a mirror of the web site will soon be out of date, it goes without saying the book will too. Now I am one of those people who like to have hard copies of books, and would generally accept it might not be as up to date as the web. (I own a copy of "The Mathematica Book", despite it is all online for free).   But in this case, given what CRC did to Weisstein and Wolfram Research, I would not out of principal buy this book.   Also, I would suggest that nobody contributes to the Wolfram Research web site, as CRC get the copyright. I use the material on there, and find it useful, but I would not write something so that CRC can benifit.   As someone else said, send Weisstein $5, then buy another book. 
 I am not a fan of Robert Kiyosaki.  I find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense.  While he introduces some worthwhile ideas, I don't think he develops them enough to be useful.  I also don't like the tone or context out of which this writer expresses himself.  I find that it comes across as unfeeling, manipulative and selfish.  I don't have anything against seeking out wealth; however, I think the means to that end is important.  In my opinion, this author ignores that important fact and at the same time does not supply the detail that people are looking for or need to achieve their financial goals.  In short, I think this book is a waste of money.  There are many other books that can give you more useful information in less space which is delivered from a more humane emotional space. 
 I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though 
 I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day.  I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money. I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option 
 I bought Regency Etiquette expecting a reference book which would explain in detail forms of address, rules of precedence,  how to make a formal introduction, whether a gentleman precedes or follows a lady up or down a staircase, and other specifics of correct behavior for the period. Had it contained this information, I would have considered it well worth the purchase price because I would have referred to it many times.   It is instead an interesting if repetitive specimen of the conduct book for young ladies, covering behavior in a very general way - you should dress to suit your body type and station, dress and carry yourself modestly, not allow gentlemen friends to take liberties, etc. The only specifics covered are the rules of precedence, and even these are given only for precedence among women, e.g., daughters of dukes, daughters of marquisses, viscountesses, etc. There are also some strange cosmetic recipes included at the end of the book, many of them so bizarre it was hard to imagine that any women of any era would be willing to put such concoctions on their skin or hair.  As another reviewer said, having read this book once I felt no need to read it again, and for this reason I regret spending $18 to buy it. However, if you are looking for an example of a general female conduct book of the period, you may consider the money well spent 
 The movie is awesome - 5 stars.  HD DVD transfer looks grainy (digital noise) and the colors are off and washed out. As crazy as it sounds, it looks worse then I remember it on VHS. Anyway, the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player.  Really dissapointing.... 
 Why? Someone tell me why. Someone e-mail me and explain to me why. There is nothing to gain here. Nothing to be learned, nothing to excite, no story. Why? Seriously, is there any documentation that might explain WHY this thing (not a film) exists. Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so unprecedented in it's poorness, that it doesn't even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick. Let me reiterate. The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book. If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented "Week End".  The only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value. Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-"A Time to Kill") and Renée Zellweger (pre-"Jerry Maguire") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes). Texas Chain Saw fans will, of course, feel the completist need to see this, the death knell of the series. And finally, I think just the concept of Leatherface as a shrieking cross-dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers. But believe me folks, this still doesn't answer the ultimate question: Why? Why?! WHY? 
 Louise Gluck is one of those bland poets that happened to be in the right place at the right time. That this bland book has won a pulitzer just shows how the quality doesn't matter, but rather WHO is getting it. These poems are filled with teenaged cliches "I speak because I am shattered", "At the end of my suffering, there was a door," etc. Totally banal, generic, and poorly broken with an occasional puff of language here or there. Really these 'poems' are just prose broken into lines. Her imagry is dull, and not really worth discussion. The reviewers who 'liked' this book do just that, since there is no critical logic that can be applied to these 'poems' to even remotely call them good. Gluck is a total lightweight, one that will, once dead, be recycled to the cannon of late 20th cent. literary fodder of one of those yet again, another overrated pulitzer winner with so little to show for it. A prise can no longer be worth much if this is the mediocrity that is winning it. And yes, I am right about this. 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 i got this shower head and guess what it doesnt fit nice i payed 40$ for a shower head i cant return 
 I like the philosophy line, but the Vanilla Birthday Cake body wash doesn't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas. The product is great though 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 i wanted this dvd because i wanted to be scared and i like the ideas of haunted house, honestly this movie was a joke yes it had a story but effects were terrible there was nothing scary about it you could tell that all the bodys and heads and arms that were being hacked off were fake.  i wish i could get my money back id rather go with psyco , motherday,the omen amityvill horroe the excoris 
 This product was not compatible with my HP LaserJet 1000.  There is no compatability list anywhere, even though it's referenced in the manual.  This further reinforces my belief that Belkin products are not worth the time, money, nor effort 
 I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 I bought this book a couple of days ago after reading the cover (Bad Jon, never judge a book by its cover) and learning that it teaches you in both Windows and Linux.  This is not the case.  I am still in chapter one trying to configure Mysql under Linux.  There is very basic linux setup configuration and then the book just assumes Windows is what you will use.  I am retiring this book and picking up another 
 This book goes nowhere, and is of extremely small size. The images are all tired old fetish pictures you would expect to see as cutting edge fashion in a Sunday Magazine rather than anything in a scene publication. It just covers the tired old fetish standards, rubber, leather, feet, that sort of thing, each with a single photo and an inane paragraph of text 
 It seems to me that this author had only two good novels: Hemlock Bay and Riptide.  The rest of them lack character depth and even a decent plot.  The writing is rudimentary.  There are better authors out there 
 This book is almost useless. The DMG is as useful for making dungeons. Back to the old junk, eh Wizards 
 In titling his book "The Post-Corporate World : Life After Capitalism," you'd think that the author would at least IMAGINE a world without corporations and without capitalism. He does not. He can not. He proceeds to knock the market economy, calling capitalism a cancer, but offers nothing to take its place. This book is only a compliation of his negative feelings about the world the way it is. Amazingly, his only meager suggestions are for people to buy from small businesses and to avoid buying from large corporations. He repeats over and over again throughout the book that capitalism is a cancer, as if repeating it would make it so... He seems to think that small businesses are not practicing capitalism, and that just .. 
 This book is much too complicated for what it needs to be.  The one point she makes in this book that I agree with is "you need to bring in less garbage into your body today that you did yesterday".   This book is close to 300 pages but it needn't be.  Raw foodism is a lifestyle choice, it's supposed to be simple.  As a vegan I looked into this book for recipes but what I found was a lot of convoluted nonsense this author touts.  If you want to eat raw, then do it.  You don't need a rule book to tell you how to do it.  As for the "maximum weight loss" claim, well, if you're filling your face with garbage right now, you will lose weight but only because you're eating healthy food.  It's not rocket science 
 When I first started using this, I loved it.  It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound.  In fact, I bought a second one for my wife.  Then, after about two weeks, it stopped working.  It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time.  I tried contacting Coby's support on the Web, but they were unresponsive.  Luckily, Amazon took it back for a refund.  Note that they no longer sell these directly.  Bet they had too many returns.. 
 there is not much to this book a few pictures and mild reading rather informative yet not as much help as popup books would have been 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity 
 This guy is pathetic and should be ashamed of himself.He was ashamed of his mother,yet thought John's mother could do no wrong.He is a hanger-on,and Im sure all Kennedy family members and true friends are disgusted.Also,did every social interaction revolve around liquor? 
 The Sony MDR-IF3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear.  Perhaps, if one were an elf or a small child, they would fit properly; however, if you're like me, a mere adult mortal, they probably won't fit you.    They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description.  If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie, the SONY MDR-IF8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money 
 The heater works fine, but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet. DeLonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period. I will not buy an oil-filled heater again 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 We used this Lonely Planet guide book on a recent trip to the US and British Virgin Islands as well as Explore Virgin Islands by Pariser. We learned about both through online reviews and bought both on Amazon.com.  Pariser's book was better; the maps are easier to use. his tips on how to get along with the locals were informative. We wanted more on the ecology from lonely planet, but turned to explore virgin islands for that. All in all, Pariser's guide had more info not found elsewhere 
 Where to begin?  The plot is transparent, the characters can barely be called that, and the writing style alone should have made the book unpublishable.  I am excessively sorry to have spent time and money on this 
 Although the radio still works, the searchlight illuminated only once, the first time I turned it on. It hasn't worked again since.  The radio works while plugged in. Unplug it and come back in an hour and no more charge.  I used the hand crank, I cranked that handle for well over a minute, when I pressed the on button the radio didn't work!  This radio is worthless in an emergency.  I give it one star because this radio does work while plugged in. Plus the dial is well lit illuminating the stations in blue light 
 I purchased this book for my 3 year old niece. As I read the story, I came across a sentence that gives a reason for the inability of the giant to catch Jack. Get this... it was because the giant was drunk. Yes... they used the word drunk. I was horrified. What kind of thing is that to read to a small child? I know in today's world children will hear about (or maybe even see) someone being intoxicated. Perhaps this was in the original story of Jack and the Beanstalk; I can't say.  But I will say that I omitted reading that sentence to my niece, removed the book from her things and put the book in the garbage 
 I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore.  Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre.  
 MMMMM BEFORE ALL YOU VIWERS GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH THE BEAUTY OF THE WORK IN THIS BOOK..DO A LITTLE RESEARCH..DE SWERTS  IS BEST AS A COPIER..FOLLOWED BY CHEEK AND CHANCE .....GO LOOK AT THE PUBLISHED WORK OF BELGIAN DESIGNERS DANIEL OST, GEERT PATTYN, IVAN POLEMAN AND MONIQUE VANDEN BERGHE..THERE YOU WILL FIND THE ORIGINALS...NAUGHTY NICO TRYING TO PULL THE WOOL OVER AMERICAN  VIEWERS  EYES 
 I believe that life is too short and books that really deserve to be read too plentiful (not to mention movies worth watching, games worth playing, ...) for anyone to spend more than five minutes on this book. It's amazing how marketing can help sell such fluffy material. Any time, I recommend "If You Want to Write" by Brenda Ueland instead 
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 I recently bought this "Literary Classics" edition of "The  Diaries of Adam & Eve" expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled "Translated by Mark Twain" and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful "first family" stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition 
 don't just automatically hit "not helpful" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi 
 Some time in the future, historians will look back on the 2nd half of the 20th Century and wonder what spurred an otherwise enlightened society to lap up dreck like _Against Our Will_ as though it actually had any merit.   It is difficult to imagine that the author actually intended to enlighten anyone with this bombastic, stilted, sophomoric garbage. The Feminazis who will read this are already convinced that men are the root of all evil. Open-minded women with a shred of intelligence and critical thinking will recognize the arguments as spurious, the vocabulary as inflammatory and the "evidence" contrived to support pre-determined points. I can only conclude that the author intended to provoke and titillate, much like Jose Canseco's recent tell-all.  The quality of research that went into this book rivals that of an Oliver Stone film or a 9/11 conspiracy film. Apart from being an excellent example of poor journalism, the main value of this book is that it will help fill up the "men are pigs" section of your library.  Save your money for horoscope readings or something else more credible 
 I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.   I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly 
                                                          Snuggled like a tumor in between the two 'Tropics' came Henry Miller's grotesquely dull work of semi-self-indulgence, 'Black Spring.' He must have been suffering from some kind of social disease that he humped-up in Paris when this otherwise 1st rate, 2nd rate author vomited up this indigestible piece of trash.  I hated every page of "Black Spring" save one paragraph in the first quarter of the novel in which Miller describes the coal-stained hands of a hot-coffined labourer. Notwithsitting that small bit of grin, I stand by my chopfallen displeasance for not having been forced at gun point to read 'Black Spring' from cover to shining black cover . . I volunteered to spend my time with this grotesque, libidinous assemblage - indeed, an air-conditioned nightmare.  
 not sure how you expect me to review it, you have not shipped it to me yet 
 I needed this book for a class.  It was one of the worst books I have read.  The first big problem is that every example is about fireworks.  I found myself often struggling with firework concepts to understand the book.  The second problem is that the book continually has questions/problems with the answer in the book.  Before the concept seems to be fully explained, it is asking you to complete a diagram.  I want the book to show me example, explain it and then test me, not test me beforehand 
 Great acting and action!  Libeling Thomas Dewey ruined the movie for me.  Thomas Dewey put mobsters in jail.  He didn't take money from them and no evidence exists that he did.  Hoodlum is a complete fabrication.  I can't understand attacking the reputation of a good man. Disgusting.  Also the role of Bumpy Johnson was overstated.  He didn't have such power.  Decent movie but absolutely rotten history 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 You really hate to dislike a guy who lives life to the fullest and had to saw his arm off with an inch-long blade.  But for those with an eye to subtext, dislike is precisely what you'll find yourself experiencing not long into the second or third chapter.  Forgive me Aron, but you're kind of a d-bag.  Like many others, I found myself skipping forward with increasing speed past the uninteresting biographical excursions and self-flattering anecdotes, until I was full-bore just looking for the part where he cuts his arm off, desperate for some kind of stimulation.  Unfortunately, the payoff is lacking.    Most galling about this book, even more so than the autobiographical filler (one quickly gets the sense that Aron's wringing every drop out of his life in case he never gets to write another book), is the fact that the experience fails to even budge him out of his self-centered perspective.  I don't fault the guy for thriving in dangerous situations (I envy him), but it's clear that the only thing he took away from his plight was another testament to his status as The Greatest Most Important Person in the World.     By the time he's videotaped himself going through an insane laundry list of locations to scatter his ashes over, started barking orders to the rescuers who are doing everything they can to help him, and assured us several times by the end how right he was about everything all along, there's a good chance you won't have a shred of empathy for Aron left.  The man had to drink his own piss and yet didn't learn a thing about humility 
 The introductory chapters promise a methodological approach on intructional design. Forget it. There are hardly any research findings in the book, and of those, none come from the author. The book keeps repeating  itself by saying that we deal with all kinds of instructions on a daily  basis, up to the point where you start skipping the text. In the end, all  that's left is the catalogue of an exhibit of instructional design  examples. There's even a hint that this is what the book was made out of.. 
 Love to review History Today, but haven't seen a copy yet.  Any ideas 
 The book is convincingly argued, but the recommended supplements had no effect on me whatsoever, even though the book says the effects appear within minutes 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 If you could do one thing better than GOD, would you still believe?...............  I would like you to imagine for a moment, a mother's love. I think we can all agree, the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind, in any time or culture. Now imagine you are the mother of two children. One boy and one girl, their ages are unimportant.  Got the image in your head? Great, now imagine one child is always a troublemaker, quite a little heathen if you will. The child never listens to anything you say, gets in trouble at school, and even sometimes says they hate you. Child number two, is a perfect little angel, always does what they are told, hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep.   Of course you may discipline the naughty child, but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world?   Of course you say?   Well let's see..........  Late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep, upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames. Knowing both children are inside, and could be burning alive at this very moment, you know you need to make a quick judgement. Which child will you save??????  What ??    Both you say?   Why would you save both children?????  What?? Because you love both of them??? Why?  One child is a complete terror, and doesn't even love you!!! Why would you do such a thing???  The Christian God wouldn't!!  What you say??? God has unconditional love, even more than a mere human mother?  Really????  Well, let's take a look at the GOD of love for just a moment...  God has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or "believe" in him, with fire for ALL ETERNITY does that sound like unconditional love to you???  If I, as a mere human mother, can love my children with the unconditional love that GOD cannot, does he truly love and forgive better than us "silly" humans that he supposedly created?   Or are we all just ignorant children, hoping that our "father's" approval (with strict unrealistic conditions), equals love?  You decide... Can you do something better than God?  What you say, if he didn't love us he wouldn't have sent Jesus to "save" us and forgive our sins? We'll believing in Jesus is still a condition isn't it? Something to think about.  Ps.    The sins of god include: murder (of the whole world except the ark), impregnating a virgin, rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town, acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament, etc. etc. etc. If a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever. Yet we excuse God by saying he knows what's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is GOD. Our American laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of GOD who cannot keep his own commandments. If God was truly a perfect being he would have known in his "all time seeing vision" that we would mess up, and he wouldn't have tested eve with the apple. If God never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out? If God didn't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send Jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it? I thought God knew everything. Frankly I've seen better administrative work during the Clinton administration, and that's saying something.  When will the (educated) wealthy countries learn to spread hope through actual tangible help to third world nations instead of "helping" them with false promises of heaven while we steal their oil, diamonds, and hope?  We have battered those weaker than us with our "religion" for far too long Somebody stop the planet, this "saved" Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist turned Evangelical Atheist wants to get off.  Angela  (San Antonio, Texas)   
 this book was a long, drawn-out read. i enjoy some parts but i expected more action, suspense and drama. definitely a love story, i have to say i was looking for more. i do recommend it to other readers but i have to say, don't rush to go out and read it 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 Why when there are talented writers out there with original ideas, do people never see their work and continue to produce this kind of crap? Luv Mom 
 Pearl Harbor...December 7th...a date which will live in infamy.  This film took on a subject near and dear to the hearts of Americans everywhere, and failed to do it justice.  Fantastic explosions and effects and a quality score from Hans Zimmer could not resurrect this movie from the stench of mediocrity.  A tacked on love story was butchered further by the B-level acting "talent" of Ben Affleck, but one gets the sense that, even perfectly done, it would not have worked against the backdrop of the terrible attack.  It would be like the soldiers on Normandy Beach stopping for a romantic tryst halfway up a sand dune.  The movie also played out about an hour too long.  The last hour (all AFTER the attack on us) just pushed my opinion of the movie lower and lower.  All that said, I did mention that the movie had solid effects and a wonderful score.  But poor acting and a bad script were just too much to overcome.  Steer clear of this one 
 Speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life I can honestly say this book did nothing for me. I do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies. However, I don't think this book gets that message across! It sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does, failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive. Besides that, it's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive. Also, I beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again. Close to 60% of people in America are overweight, possibly more. This includes children. We are far bigger than we were 100 years ago and ingest far larger portions of food. Heart attacks are killing more and more people and it's victims are getting younger, sometimes even children and people under 30 years old. Sure, some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority. I do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but I don't think pushing overweight models would be any better. If you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself, you might like this book. If you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked, this will sound like a really whiny, excuse filled, negitive book. Yes, I work out to be healthy. Yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how I feel. No, I don't want to look like a supermodel. I loved my body fat and I love it now, that's why I lost the weight to begin with. I want to live as long as I can in this body and feel the best I can instead of feeling slow, tired and heavy like I used be. I feel much better, my chronic foot pain went away and I have lots more energy. I work out 5 days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too. This book does nothing to help people in the long run, it's just someone's angry rant about their warped perspective! Being obese isn't healthy and that's why people think it looks ugly, it's not because we are a brainwashed, shallow society! And no, being fat is not a fate worse than death, it IS death and kills millions of people every year!     
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 I had high expectations for this book.  I have studied almost every stop motion book there is and I have to say this is nothing special.  There are a few tips in it that I found enlightening but not enough to hold the whole book.  Although the author seems knowledgable in the field, she does not put her instructions across clearly.  I found it difficult to follow in that she gives a bit of info and then directs you to looks in later chapters, when writing instruction/how-to books it is wise to put things in order so thats the more basic blocks of info are placed at the beginning so you can refer BACK.  And perhaps this book may be a tad more useful to readers in the UK, as the author refers mostly to UK companies and retailers for supplies.  Over all I feel that there are a few things in this book that are useful and can not be found in other books.  Perhaps if you already have a collection (such as myself) it is nice to own to compliment other books, but as a stand alone it falls short of being very helpful 
 but not to read! :-) Simply unbelievable that Matt Dalton would feel he could write anything about the Peterson case worth reading! It rates right up there with something that Falconer (original juror #5) might pen! Some of these reviews certainly remind me just how gullible peeps can be. I'm glad I wasted no money on this borrowed drivel - just wasted the time it took to read it! I rated it with 1 star simply because that's the lowest choice here. In reality it's less than zero 
 ...i have Denise Austin's "Shrink Your Female Fat Zones" DVD and I LOVE LOVE it, so I decided to pick this one up. I am SO sorry that I did. I work out with my friend and we could barely get through 10 minutes - the moves are ridiculous and, although it did get our heart rates up, it's mostly because we were laughing hysterically at the moves. Honestly, they just made us feel ridiculous. I recommend getting the other DVD. 
 This one might be a good reference book.  But I was expecting a self paced program with a tutorial or step by step program but it is not such tool.  Now I'm starting to search or investigate for a new book.  The book presentation is good but I'm disappointed with its contents and format.  The reading is too dense or heavy for a beginner 
 The story was terrible. Didnt care for any of the characters. Couldn't put it down cause I was just trying to get to the end in hopes it got better.... It didn't. The best thing about it was it was a pretty quick read and I will now avoid Palahniuk in the future. No idea why everyone loves this book. Dont get caught up in the hype. It Stinks 
 Ellroy here asks us to join him in a riff of incest and pornography, accompanied by sociopaths and tedious plot riddles, all written in a bizarre bare style that starts to wear thin after about ten pages. No jazz, just incessant noise 
 Although it looks very nice, this item is a failure. I found it to rust inside after about a month. Once rusted, no matter how you clean it, it will rerust. I have quite a few items from the "Naturewood" collection as it is our pattern and this item is one of the rare bad items 
 I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 I don't recommend this book at all....It was a complete waste of money,  No information a regular person wanting to put on a little teaparty or have tea-friends over could use 
 I love this song, and it is my favorite on the album. I was really looking forward to the cd single being released, and waited around 2 months for it to finally come out. When it did come out in Australia, it only contained the radio edit, junior sanchez mix and new song history.Looks as though we only got Jump part 2 here in Australia.   I was very disappointed that the other remixes were not included,  and I did not like the junoir sanchez mix at all. I was really looking forward to hearing the Jaques Lu cont mix, as I have enjoyed his past work for Madonna, and also the extended album version. Unfortunately neither were included on the cd single in Australia.  
 This is a very hard book for younger teens. Our 8th grade class has not understood the high class chinese philosphy that the cat uses we can never figure out whether he is being sarcastic or being real. Our teacher laughs  at us because he thinks that it is so simply to follow. I have noticed that  is is not a good book of the younger generation of kids unless they know  alot about chinese philosophy 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 I saw this on a "best of 2005" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album 
 As a collector of many forms of Electronica new & old, I'm going to have to side with Matthew Collins on this one.  The book is truely volumunous in it's bulk of basic biographical info on lots of dj's and groups, but it lacks the Discography information collectors crave.  It's true that this book is great for a beginner I guess, but most of the people who would be willing to buy this are probably really into Techno & Electronica, and I would think would expect a little more than what seems to be a bunch of info from the Allmusic website on Biographies.  It is worth it's price if you have cash to spare, and a spot on your shelf, but really, if you have the internet then just go to the website Allmusic.com for more info than there is in the book.  And I have to say I agree with Mr Collins on "who the heck is Amon Duul"  Maybe the group was an important figure in obscure indie-electro or something, but they're not a part of the Techno music that I love & know.  And Prodigy is an awesome group, they just get bashed cause they got too popular, and I guess you can't be popular and be part of Electronica 
 I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone.       
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 In each chapter and throughout this book, the author writes whatever comes to her mind and therefore, it is hard to understand where she heads and concludes what.  I don't know in which category this book fits but definitely not in technical anaysis. 
 This movie really showcases the extreme dorkiness of the early 80s. But it's really no one's fault, they didn't KNOW they were dorks back then, that's just the way everyone acted before Michael Jackson came along.  Clarence Beeks (the Breakfast Club guy) turns in his usual McGruff the Crime Dog performance. And nice appearance by Tom Hanks too; his 2nd best performance, very closely behind Saving Private Ryan, which I would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie. They go well together.  Oh well, at least this movie gave the Police Squad! an idea on how to open up their show. And it's still better than Hercules in New York, although by very much, no 
 One earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as I requested, they "fixed" it.   I will not be using Amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon   
 I have read all three books in this trilogy. I started with Earth Song not knowing that it was a trilogy. Earth Song is #2 and it is very enjoyable. It is funny and it held my interest. Then I went to #1 and finally to #3 which is Fire Song. The main male characters..Roland in Secret Song and I can't remember the guys name in Fire Song...border on insane! They are so jealous and suspicious through the entire book. Well, to be fair, the last 10 pages they find they really love the lady...too late for me I guess. At one point Daria got so mad at Roland she knocked him down some stairs. I enjoyed reading that part because he deserved it. I love Catherine Coulter's writing but found myself getting mad reading this after the guys had called their ladies lying and deceitful one too many times! 
 these glasses don't have the heft or size to accomodate a serious whisky drinker.  Cute juice glasses, but not a cornerstone to your bar collectio 
 This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film 
 Like many of the other reviewers I feel cheated.  Anything contoversial was left out.  As a dumb suburban honkey myself, I demand the reissue of this dvd with "Kill the White People".  What good are all those funny sketches if SNL doesn't have the balls to put them on dvd?  I also didn't read any reviews as I assumed I was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago.  Instead I got scammed.  What's even worse is the "bonus scene" is the Opie Cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs.  Please explain how this is a bonus.  I was furious when the movie ended.  The least they can do is put out a part 2.  I thought I was buying the Cadillac of comedy.  Instead I got the Ford Pinto of crap 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 Having heard so much about this revisionist school, I was propelled to read this book.  Such unscientific biased absurdity certainly has some motive behind it. Interestingly enough, many of the details within could be used as a treatise behind Herman Goering's testimony at Nuremburg that the extermination of Jews, gypsies and countless others never happened. They merely died of starvation in war-like conditions.  This book ignores detailed existing records that document orders and transport of Zyklon B for the vast death camp complexes.   How can one even concoct theories like those within when there are still numerous witnesses alive who watched Jews enter the gas chambers and then retrieved the bodies? (Sonder Kommandoes). Perhaps the eyewitness accounts of Jews are not admissible evidence to these "scholars"?  With regard to the author being persecuted and driven from his  country, I have no compassion since he and his family, unlike millions,  were spared their  lives.   My immediate family includes survivors who witnessed the Holocaust with their own two eyes. Isn't is a great coincidence that their stories all coincide with  hundreds of thousands of other victims? Were they all given a Holocaust Mainfesto after the war's conlusion?       
 According to Eastwood's friend, Richard Schickel, Eastwood is an auteur.  There is a lot of Eastwood-butt kissing going on in this laughable "authorized" biography.  That's to be expected but it is too over the top.  The strange thing is that Schickel get's his facts screwed up on the films as if he has only seen them once and a long time ago.  Was the editor asleep at the wheel?  After the bomb of Eastwood's  "Blood Work", I think that people do not care, anyway 
 I bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with Lyme disease.  I found it minimally useful.  It is relaxing, but I was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one's body.  Perhaps it is intended to heal the soul, which may ultimately heal the body, but I was disappointed 
 After reading "Firehand", I was really looking forward to reading "Echoes in Time". "Firehand" was a continuation of the characters I had grown up reading. When "Echoes" came out I was looking forward to more of the same. Not So. Anyone who had read "Galactic Derelict" would have some pretty serious questions as to how we could have arrived at the story of "Echoes". And where was Andre Norton as her characters were being cut up into minor background players? I could detect no trace of her hand in this.  This story did nothing to answer the questions of the much older story and left considerable questions to be answered from its own content. Like, what just happened? Even rereading it with the mindset of letting it stand on its own did'nt help. All in all a very confusing mish-mash of a story that never would have been purchased but for it's connection to Norton and her older stories.   Sherwood Smith was quite good in the Solar Queen stories and I expected better this time around. Oh well, I suppose you can't get it right every time. Will I continue to look forward to more of these collaberations? Yes. I'll just look at them with more of a caveat from now on. And who knows, maybe Sherwood Smith will improve as a comfort level with the characters develops 
 These guys are nothing more than just Alice in Chains ripoffs, AIC is hands down alot better than these guys.  Hell, Godcrap even copied their sun logo, this half-assed AIC cover band appeals only to those damn "otakus" with no girlfriend and play Dungeons & Dragons all day in their parents' basement.  Do your ears a favor, pick up "Dirt" by Alice in Chains 
 Colson's definition of "lie" is simple and pernicious. Any belief he does not share is a lie, and anyone who believes something he doesn't is a liar. It is perfectly fine to reject the beliefs he calls "lies," it's not in the least bit okay to impugn the honor of those who disagree with him.  And, of course, a logical analysis of the relevant evidence will reveal that most of the beliefs he calls "lies" are in fact true, and the rest are at least arguable.   A civilized society requires civilized discourse. A society where the beliefs of others are routinely characterized as lies is not a civilized society 
 I was excited when I found this book, i have always loved the fairy tale series.  I only found 2 stories in the whole collection that interested me.  The others seemed to be written by amateurs, had poor stories and the story by Tanith Lee didn't even make any sense 
 I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minute 
 Berkhof's work itself is an essential document for the thinking Christian. With much of what one sees going on today, this is put into even sharper relief. This particular publishing is the `New Combined Edition', giving you a lengthy introductory work as well as the work proper, topping it out at over 900 pp. But the publishers cast it in a small book format. You have to forcibly hold the book open to read it. I would suggest getting the The Banner of Truth edition but I don't know if it will include the introduction 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 I seem to recall that the author of this "book" did a documentary that aired on PBS some years ago, which was not too bad. Not being able to find a video of the documentary, I looked forward to the 2nd edtion of the book. What a waste! Whoever indexed this thing must have been drunk at the time! Look up any entry in the index and almost none of the references are correct! e.g. "Swift, Wesley" refers you to pages 14, 15: but there's no mention of him on those two pages; "Rockwell, George Lincoln" refers you to page 21: no mention of Rockwell on that page, but there is a mention of Tom Metzger, whose listing in the index shows no reference to page 21!!! Beyond this, the book was written from the viewpoint of someone with the mindset of Hillary Clinton: not a very inviting alternative to individuals portrayed in the book 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 I find the subject matter of the transition between the middle ages and the renaissance as a fascinating period.  This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.  However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John "Fairborn" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.    The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.    Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.   
 Poor communication.  I was notified that the printer was not coming when they said it would, but was never given another date.  After waiting some time I cancelled the order and said I ordered another one from someone else.  I guess they don't read their email either.  The next day they shipped the item.  Now I have two, but am not going to spend another $20 to ship it back to them.  Believe me I would never buy from this company again 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 Somewhat outdated, rehashed and self aggrandizing. More historical than cutting edge. You can do better! 
 My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both hated it.  It was really pathetic.  Perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it.  Yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people.  It is pathetic.  I would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with.  Low self esteem.  Do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this.  Perhaps it is funny, but just do not be around one of these people in reality.  It is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are.  Not all men are virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they have no clue about women.  they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand. 
 Most of the songs here are ballads of which there are two that I really like:  "Back Before the War" and "She Wasn't Good Enough For Him".  The rest of the stuff here is unmemorable.  
 I just can't understand who thinks this guy has any talent!  REALLY!  So many other funny guys...and this hack is the guy that is popular???!!  AVOID this CD...wasted my money 
 this book sucks, it taught me nothing, because of this boook i faild algebra.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 Fred Barnes used to be a smart man -- rather conservative for my tastes, but not unintelligent.  But this book is nothing more than hagiography -- it reminds of Henri Barbusse's book on Stalin, which informed guillible readers that the Leader sometimes went down to help unload the docks when nobody was looking.   The book is shockingly one-sided -- Baby Bush can do no wrong.   It's been a long time since a semi-respected author has glorified a war criminal so passionately.  
 The books are witty and charming. This, in stark contrast, is formulaic schlock. Americans -- and much of the world's consumers -- prefer their entertainment predigested so it doesn't require chewing, so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly.  In the land of limitless equality, everything is reduced to equal tastelessness. If you want impart the capacity for discernment to your child, you could start by avoiding this twaddle. The Eloise books are special, while this movie is mere product 
 James Banks, considered a master scholar in multicultural studies, came right out of the Civil Rights Movement.  One would think that any strategy for teaching ethnic studies should be objective, but this is not the case.  His writing is infused with bitterness carried from his personal experiences, and rather than discuss tolerance and appreciation, he preaches reverse-racism.  He has a tendency to box people into groups according to their heritage: Mexican-American, Italian-American, etc.  What if you do not identify with any group whatsoever and are the product of early 20th century alien assimilation?  Those who cannot find a cultural niche are considered Anglo-Saxon.  If you pay attention to his writing, you notice that being white is not a good thing.  Multicultural studies should promote tolerance.  This intolerant mode of thinking is outdated and needs serious revision.  
 I really expected this book to be pretty good.  The recipe titles are enticing and some of Elaine Magee's other books are better (not the best out there, but definitely better).  She must have had a tight deadline or she was bored or something on this one because the food is mediocre at best.  You can find so many better (and even healthier) versions of the same dishes online for free.  
 Saw the show in Washington and nearly fell asleep. Should never have been made. The score is dismall with a couple of all too brief moments of musicality, wisely given to Maureen McGovern. However, it's not enough to save this misguided mess. Skip the CD, pick up Jane Eyre, a musical version of a classic that works beautifully and deserved more success than it acheived 
 This product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  Waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver 
 WHY  
 Although the setup for this movie's plot was interesting, the story gradually unravels in a mess of implausibility and a clunky climax. Campbell Scott is believable, but Rebecca Pidgeon's acting is painful to watch, and her reading of lines is amateurish and sounds too forced. (Perhaps her husband, director David Mamet, should make his next movie about the perils of nepotism.) It is unclear why her character would try to help Scott's character from being captured by the police, while continuing to lead him into their hands. There are countless holes in the plot, and the ending does not tie up several loose ends 
 I am on a mission. I am out to find un doctored video of what happen that day. In this edition of America Remembers is media hog wash. All of the impacts of the planes have been removed so that the victims and the american people are blinded by what really hit those towers.   Although they show 1 to 2 impacts of planes, this stripped down version of the real events hides the truth.   In this dvd no reports of the hundreds of eye witness accounts that reveal many explosions going on at the twin towers before and after the "planes" hit.  There is so much left out of the dvd that i decided to compare it to the first dvd.   The differences clearly show that a lot more needed to be edited before the public figures out, what really happened that day.  This dvd is a one sided slap in the face to victims and Americans in general.   Everyone that reads this should call or write cnn and tell them we want the original dvd. Not this government version of events of mass murder 
 Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management.  This book is not a good choice for college-level courses. 
 Initially written in 1966, this survey of 19th and 20th century modern art is defintely showing its age.  Despite five revisions between 1971 and 1993, most of the references to critical scholarship date from the 1950s and 1960s.  I do not imagine this book will be revised again.  The author maintains a rather tradition and connoisseur-bound view of the periods under consideration that sometimes lacks engagement and vibrancy.  It is as if the revolution in art criticism during the 60s/70s/80s never happened.    I don't know the reason for why the period 1880 to 1940 was chosen as the years bracketing this survey, but the result of choosing the 1880 date is that two of the major figures in French Modernism (Courbet and Manet) are conspicuously absent.  The author has also chosen to focus on individual artists, sometimes at the expense of more fully covering art movements and social context within which they emerged.  Images are decently chosen, though small and primarily black and white.  Focus of the text is on established European artists with barely a mention of artists in North America.  Readers might consider the following Open University texts covering similar ground to Hamilton but in a more engaging manner:  Modernity and Modernism : French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, by Francis Frascina, et al. Primitivism, Cubism, Abstraction : The Early Twentieth Century, by Gill Perry, et al. Realism, Rationalism, Surrealism : Art Between the Wars, by David Batchelor, et al 
 The difference between cant and deceit is that the peddler of cant believes his own nonsense.  In this case, the cant begins with the very title "the Jewish New Testament". Jews have one ONE (1) Testament: it's called the Tanakh by Jews and the "Old Testament" by Christians. If you accept the "New Testament" as sacred scripture, you are (intellectually) not a Jew anymore but something else.    I would use the same argument if the roles were reversed --- if this were, say, an ex-Catholic convert to Judaism arguing that one can reject half the Nicean creed, downgrade the "New Testament" to literature-plus, and still be an evangelical Christian. One cannot.   Let Jews be Jews (although some might wish to learn a bit more about what makes believing Christians tick), and let Christians be Christians (although they may wish to learn more about the Jewish roots of their own faith --- commendably, an increasing number are). Each serving G-d in their own way.  To use a Jewish metaphor: Judaism is like meat and Christianity like dairy. Each, prepared according to the relevant rules, is kosher in itself, but mixtures of meat and dairy are always TREIF (nonkosher) 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 I'm not usually so critical, but I was utterly disappointed in this book. The title is misleading. The '45 plans' mentioned in the title were not plans at all. They were at best 'general arrangements'. While overall dimensions were given, most 'plans' barely mention materials of construction and certainly didn't include an actual bill of material. Some of the illustrations were little more than crude, badly proportioned hand sketches.  I guess I expected more from someone who felt they were qualified to write a book. I would have to guess that this is the authors first book. Apparently the publisher wasn't paying any attention during this project. A synopsis of the book might read "throw some scrap material together and give it a cutsie name...I'll include it in my next book!! 
 I have not yet been able to fasten these things while they are in my ears. They are not useful to me at all 
 This is an unbelievably bad book. "Unbelievable" is the correct word. Lunn has trouble with sentences and paragraphs with a single subject are quite beyond him. Logical flow of thought does not occur either. Worse, as a "historian," he accepts as facts, concepts which are in great dispute or have no documentary evidence (too many to mention, but start with Mary Magdalene in France and even the existence of Arthur in England). Try another source for decoding 
 It's not too much to infer that the author's main concern in writing this book was to be the first person to deliver a Java image processing book (1999), since he says as much in one of the many radically uninspired (and frequently self-generated) "pithy" quotes that precede each chapter.    Every bad thing the other readers have said about this book is true- here's my contribution. Throughout the book, he references advanced mathematical concepts as though the expected reader was a graduate mathematics major. Nevertheless, when the concepts get easy enough to cover comprehensibly without too much effort, he explains them in detail. So, for instance, he goes into what a histogram is, what the formula for finding the roots of a binomial equation is (which we all learned in 11th grade ) etc. etc. Compare this to his explanations of the higher mathemtical concepts upon which his code depends which seem to be penned in order to win some contest for expository opaqueness.   Basically, if you can understand his fragmented, confusing, telegraphic and seemingly careless explanations then you already know enough so as not to need the book in the first place.   But hey, it was first.     
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 Usually when soundtracks come out you look forward to new recordings by familiar artists - Kimberley Locke's "Better Than This" is really the only true standout on this entire album. This is a new song by her and while it's an EXCELLENT song, the entire CD wasn't worth the cash. Howie Day's "Collide" is a great song but it's all over the radio as it is and his album is great - so if you're a huge Kimberley Locke fan, you may want to check out her new song - but other than that, this album isn't really worth it 
 Poorly edited as to content as well as style. It was just plain boring to read, only awakening when encountering the many mistakes. Of course, that could be by design. Move on and keep looking 
 A thousand blood-thirsty Trollocks are on the way to kill you and your friends.  At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon:  1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged.  2.  A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3.  A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock.  If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.    So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers.  He gave the superhero super weapons.  Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books.  Solution:  make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.    The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines.  They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.    The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something.  The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters.  When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.  I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system. 
 This book is essentially a compilation of various artists' portfolios. That's fine if you just want to peruse their work, but there is no instruction for those of us who are trying to learn how to master the techniques these artists used to create their works 
 I don't like for a biography to lie, but I think it should portray the subject in a favorable or atleast interesting light.  This biography is frustrating because it makes Churchill, who I thought was a very inspiring figure, into a rich spoiled man who stumbles into situations which brought him fame.  If he was really as uninspired and unfocused as this biography portrays him then he has a false public reputation 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 Let me just say that there are waaay better books out there on the subject, even if you just want to get a brief rundown. And you needn't even be a grammar nut like myself to feel antsy about when the next spelling or syntax error is going to show up, because there's an average of one per page. Honestly, I couldn't get through half the book, but I'm pretty sure there was nothing in the latter pages to make up for it. 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 I am not going to comment on the compilation, it is OK. The sound quality however is terrible. The supposedly rerecorded bass on the older tracks is quite weak, most of the recordings sound horrible, with a lot of distortions, elevated highs, clipping, suppressed midrange and muddy bass; "Paranoid" sounds like it was recorded with a microphone hidden in somebody's purse. I have quite a few CDs with hard-rock and metal recorded in the 70s, and they all sound better. This CD is a pain to listen to 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 Faith and science really have nothing in common, and it is science which draws the line, not on grounds of what it knows or doesn't know, but for the methodology involved to acquire this knowledge. Faith is unscientific, not because it leads to God, but because it is a bad method to build bridges. Nobody constructs even a church on nothing else but a prayer, but if you do, you better brace yourself for the consequences. It is really as simple as that. And a scientist who claims that faith and science hold common ground or could be "reconciled," oversteps exactly this line and loses all his authority as a scientist. His opinions become an entirely private matter. To be scientific means, to expose yourself to a rigorous regimen of verification and falsification. This is a matter of ethics, as much as of method. But you still have to show me the religious doctrine which would be willing to undergo an equally rigorous test and surrender the keys if it fails to pass.     It is Mr. BarbourÕs contention that in the relationship between religion and science there are 4 options: firstly Òconflict,Ó which the author sees to be "represented by fundamentalists and scientific materialists." (This is a telling way of labelling. Telling for Mr. BarbourÕs own bias that is. Because I am not avoiding the confrontation, this makes me in the philosophical sense a materialist? How interesting.) The second option is termed ÒindependenceÓ - two languages, separate domains. A third option is termed Òdialogue,Ó and the last suggestion is called Òintegration.Ó Well, this kind of categorizing is just a red herring: First, there is no actual conflict because the two sides are not really talking or listening to each other, hence there is no dialogue either. And if, God forbid, ever there should be an "integration" then this would throw us straight back to medieval scholasticism and excommunication or worse as an accepted practice. Have we already forgotten, that for most periods in history and practically in every culture, science had been received with open hostility? And you know why? Not for its knowledge, but because science is asking questions. And what about the second Òoption?Ó What option? ÒIndependenceÓ is a CONDITION for doing science, not merely a choice.     Whenever faith interferes with scientific methodology, you can be sure to get bad science, either because it sets a premium on the application of its methodology or because it limits the latitude of hypothetical propositions. (Recently I heard a "reborn" ex-scientist using the second law of thermodynamics to explain her newfound faith in "creation." It was the usual play with words. The law states, that in a closed system the amount of entropy increases to a point where all the energy comes to a rest in a state of equilibrium. So initially you have hot gas molecules clumping to clouds and drifting about in a closed chamber, which in the end will cool down and evenly distribute. From a state of low entropy we progress towards high entropy. To term the two states as "chaotic" and "ordered" is misleading and arbitrary, but it is exactly this lax use of metaphor on which people rationalize their faith.)    I mean what kind of dialogue is there anyway with institutions of which some to the present day see it as their god-given right to persecute Òheretics,Ó culture, learning, science and art, whenever and wherever they happen to dissent from doctrine? Like no other institution, the Catholic Church has been - and still is - instrumental for the relentless terrorism over common peoplesÕ sexuality and the general outlook on life, as if it is a foregone conclusion that we are creatures of some metaphysically construed sin who, simply for breathing in a fallen world, are periodically required to grovel for forgiveness. Never has a political institution wielded a more powerful instrument of mind control. A scientist who willingly subjects himself to this sort of brainwash puts in question his own credibility. Who cares for a sorry figure like Teilhard de Chardin who compromised on his scientific integrity only to find himself shunned even by his own church! That's the best part! So much for dialogue! No! Doctrine and science are a contradiction in terms and there cannot be honest dialogue with doctrine, because dialogue implies a quid pro quo, which doctrine is never willing to permit.    The most dangerous enemy of scientific methodology is bias, especially if this bias comes with institutionalized means of enforcement. So the assumption that there can be "dialogue" between the two positions, is an illusion. It is an illusion even for the inner dialogue in a single individual's conscience. Why? Because one side has yet to show that it can be flexible on its claim to hold the monopoly on exclusive "truth," while science leaves "truth" to the philosophy department and rather asserts "facts" by specific methods of enquiry and experimentation, which are to be based on hypothetical algorithms and statistical prognosis, wherever possible. It is certainly a good thing, if both sides treat each other with courtesy, but this changes nothing of the fundamental chasm - no matter how civil the behavior, the two positions remain mutually exclusive. The "dialogue" is an exchange of monologues in two different languages, and Mr. Barbour is not the man to act as a translator here. Coming to think of it, I begin to suspect a hidden agenda in Mr. BarbourÕs book. The spots of this leopard begin to look familiar ...  
 Returned item, as was leaking all over. Great product if Amazon had packed it better, I could have used it 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 Elizabeth Peters is one of my top 5 favorite authors ever.  However, this book is really bad.  I couldn't even finish it, and I really hate to stop in the middle of a book.  If you haven't read this yet, don't; read _The Crocodile on the Sandbank_ instead.  If you've already read this, please don't judge Ms Peters by this work.  I urge you to give her another shot, because _The Camelot Caper_ is well below the quality of her other books. 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 i spend some time to read the book. the book is  too simple.I don't get valuable knowledge from it.  Maybe it is suitable for the guys who have few experience in IT company. It will waste your time to peruse the book if you have some experience in software company. I'm rather disappoint at the book. I don't understand why AMAZON top the book in the product management list. 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 This product did not work. I was faithful for 1 month with no results 
 This book is for you if:  If you think that the Weekly World News deserves a Pulitzer for its coverage of "Bat Boy".   Believe that wearing a foil hat to bed will stop the Government from reading your mind while you sleep.  Think that the Apollo moon missions were staged in a Johnson Space Center soundstage.  Pat the Bunny has more tangible content than this book does.  Not recommended.      
 To give you an idea of where Lipstadt is coming from, I need only recount what she called John Sack on Charlie Rose (see title of this review). In a phone conversation afterwards in which he reminded her that he had sent her a favorable note about her book, she told him (he said):  "You are worse than a Holocaust denier."  This should tell us all we need to know about Deborah Lipstadt's belief (or non-belief) in the indivisibility of the truth. John Sack painstakingly researched Polish concentration camps for Germans, mostly civilians where 60,000 to 80,000 perished, men, women, children, and babies.  According to his research, 3/4 of the camps' staffs were Jewish.  This is to be found in John Sack's AN EYE FOR AN EYE, whose facts have been carefully checked.  Lipstadt is a denier herself of historical atrocities that sort of provide some balance to the Holocaust.   I wouldn't support seeing her treated as Irving, Zundel, and many others have been for real or alleged Holocaust denial because no one should be jailed for their reading or misreading  (even intentional misreading ) of history.  But what she does is in principle no better than what they do.  She denies other atrocities she doesn't want to believe in.   But what is much, much worse is that she wants to deny any forum for those whom she targets.  She, herself, is even  worse than the Holocaust deniers, because while being a denier of another sort herself, she wants to shut up the other deniers.  At least they haven't tried to do that to her, with the possible exception of David Irving and his libel suit against her.  Still Irving has never advocated jailing people for their beliefs.  I'm not sure how Lipstadt feels about the many jailings in Germany and Austria for Holocaust denial.  But the only Holocaust denier or so-called denier that I know of that she says should be released from imprisonment is Irving himself, and her reason seems to be only that she doesn't want to see him made into a martyr.  That's not too impressive a record in supporting a humane, free society, my dear, not at all 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 LOOK, ANYTIME AN AUTHOR TEAMS UP WITH ANOTHER ONE ( whom i don't know ) TO WRITE A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST WARNING . MY EXCUSE THEN ?  WELL, I WAS IN A HOTEL ON VACATION, COULDN'T SLEEP ...AND THIS  PULP FICTION WAS THE LESSER OF THE EVILS IN THE GIFTY-GIFT SHOP WHERE I PAID FULL PRICE.  I SUSPECT I MAY EVEN HAD PAID CANADIAN PRICES EVEN THO I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C.   LOL...THE JOKE IS ON ME .  BUT, PER USUAL I SHALL DONATE THIS  HARDLY BENT BOOK TO EITHER MY LIBRRAY,  OR IF THEY REFUSE TO TOUCH IT ...A PRISON WHERE THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN. I GAVE IT TWO STARS FOR CORRECT SPELLING ....LOL.  I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH INSOMNIA  
 I learn much more from watching the two great masters in TV than reading their cook books. I was really looking forward to receive these 4-disc DVDs.  Unfortunately when the package arrived, two of the discs were not secured inside the box and there were deep scratches on the surface of the discs.  I returned the set and asked for a replacement.  The second package arrived with the same problem.  A La Carte, the distribution, could have come up with a better packaging than cramping 4 discs inside a single box.  I decided to keep the merchandize because I really treasure this TV series.  But if you are not as crazy as I am, don't buy this set until the distributor comes up with a better package 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 Somewhere within the 1,000 pages of this book is a very good 600 page book struggling to emerge.  In Hamilton's desire to craft a comprehensive future world he launches into sub-plots, characters and details that fail to serve his story line. The result is a story that plods along relieved by only moments at a quicker pace.  When the pace picks up Pandora's Star is difficult to put down. Alas, these moments are far too few leaving one looking for the end of chapters in the hope that the next chapter will bring more energy.  Halfway through Pandora's Star I became aware that this was only the first half of the story. Only after reading some 2,000 pages of Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained is this saga brought to a close. Given the slog to get through Pandora's Star, Judas Unchained may have to await my being stranded on a desert island 
 I TRIED THIS DEODORANT FOR 2 WEEKS AND IT PEELED OF MY SKIN. STAY AWAY 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 First in a series, BENEATH A BLOOD RED MOON by Shannon Drake is a paranormal romance that's a cross between vampire melodrama and a police murder-mystery.  Spanning 200 years, it follows the lives of the mysterious Montgomery heiresses, rumored to be vampires, contrasted with the modern-day love affair between a cop named Sean and the latest Montgomery heiress, Maggie.  Sean is also the lead cop on a series of gruesome murders committed by a serial killer imitating Jack the Ripper - and who somehow is connected to Maggie.  I didn't particularly care for the story ... and my list of complaints is long.  The book is actually a quick read and keeps your attention, but I felt it was too melodramatic (and cheesy), especially the prologue.  I also didn't like the author's writing style; she wasted a lot of time on unnecessary "fluff" details and dialogue, none of which pertained to the plot or romance.  The plot line itself was interesting, but I was rolling my eyes way too often to enjoy it and had figured out the major secrets long before they were finally revealed.  The happily-ever-after ending was also wrapped up too nicely, with no explanation as to how "the miracle" happened.  All in all, it was an unsatisfying reading experience.  FYI: Erotica writer Angela Knight's THE FOREVER KISS or JANE'S WARLORD both handle these themes much better, the former being about vampires, the latter having a time-traveling Jack the Ripper. 
 The author has no familiarity with his subject and routinely provides the reader with incorrect information 
 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 this product is extremely difficult to learn. I recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning. 
 Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.  The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.  Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.  I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.    I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes 
 Sorry, this isn't a very good book at all. It is just a few lines and paragraphs strung together. Some of the information is OK but some just reflects an attitude and not real style. Better to get Clothes and the Man or Dressing the Man. Those are great books about dressing and style 
 Good thing I received this book for free.  It was too wordy and wasn't well written.  For example, under mental disorders the author forgot to define Schizophrenia as he did with the other disorders - looks sloppy.  Also, the protocols for illnesses were nearly all the same; this book could have been 1/3 the size.  It started off with SOME good information, although nothing new, and had a nice personal success story.  Soon after that you get slapped in the face with its sales gimmick, which is difficult to get past.  Why?  Because it's difficult to trust informtion coming from a person who is going to benefit financially from his recommendations - 100% of the recommended supplements are from his company.  As a previous reviewer wrote, why didn't Rubin give us the products he used to recover - those before he created his own?  Rubin's focus on sales is too strong which makes it difficult to trust his recommendations 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.  Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale. 
 Boycott these onions! They are taking away all the jobs from perfectly good white onions! 
 I don't know how this totally inferior book got published. If I'd seen the cover before I bought it, saying she'd seen every Shirley Temple movie 8 times, that would have given me a clue as to her taste and I would never have bought it.  A waste of time and certainly no one could consider her a responsible movie critic.  The movies recommended are hardly 4 star movies.  Most of them aren't even worth seeing.  No wonder you probably haven't seen them 
 phil_swanwick@hotmail.com The author's dictionary format did not suit the ambiguous and anti-establishment setup of the movie at all.  Besides the formatting, it does include some ineresting and sometimes deep analysis of  the plot, characters and underlying principles.  A solid review, but  inadequate as a profesional work and hardly worth buyin 
 As a student of history, I am disappointed in this book. The author fails to cite his sources.  He makes his arguments with facts, dates, and quotes, but does not tell the reader where the information comes from.  The only useful part of the book is the suggestions for further reading.  If you are looking for a serious history of the Japanese internment, keep looking 
 This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far! 
 This tool works well, but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher.  When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon.  Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher.  There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead 
 I can't say enuff 'bout this but I thought it was a novel that has to deal w/ life of something like from famous black authors of Richard Wright to Langston Hughes to Ralph Ellison or somethin like that. I believe it's a ok book even tho I don't read it very oftenly all the time 'cuz it deals w/ the situations between HIV/AIDS, sex and celibacy. First of all I never read a sex book in my life. I thought it was cool but it goes to tell you how to beware about the diffrence bout the good side vs. the bad side of sex. I'ma think I'll keep it 'round a lil longer or so. Good work E. Lynn Harris 
 I thought this book was going to be sooo great! I love Hake and that back sounded awsome. The character,Ruth, in the begining even sounded so intreseting but then it was so boring. It just died in the middle. Even before the middle. Why was there so much on secondary characters when there was absolutly no point. There was no spark between the two main characters by the time the ended up together i was so bored with them. Josh had like no emotions either. he was so even on one line it was wierd! If i'd known it was going to be soo flat I wouldnt have bothered, read Measure of a Lady much more Intresting 
 "Modigliani" (2004) is a self-indulgent, pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist. Writer-director Mick Davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work. Ironically, the viewer has a better understanding of Pablo Picasso than Amedeo Modigliani. Despite his boundless enthusiasm, Andy Garcia is simply too old for the title role. An irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate 
 I bought this DVD for my third-grade twins who are having difficulty memorizing math facts, and don't quite understand the relation between these math facts and the real world.  I thought this DVD would be perfect, explaining basic math facts with humor and real life examples.  But their explanations are way over the heads of this age group.  In explaining the concept of "carrying over" while adding, for instance, here is what is said and written out on the screen:  "Carrying over means you take the digit in the tensplace of the digit place sum, and carry over that digit to the next digit place to the left in your addition problem.  You do this whenever the sum amount in the digit place is greater than nine."  Yeah, *I* get it, but it is not the simplest way to present it to an elementary grade child.  I'm not certain what grade level this series is for -- perhaps middle school and above? -- but definitely not for those just starting out 
 I would like to clear up some confusion regarding the use of the terms "illusion" and "delusion," which Freud himself distinguishes early in this book.  A "delusion" is something that is believed that is not true.  An "illusion" is something that might be true or false, but that is believed because we want to believe it. Religion is then regarded as the fullfillment of infantile wishes, implying that it is something we outgrow.  But Freud has admitted by his choice of terminology that religion might be true.  As to the question of Freud's atheism, the book cites, as I recall, evidence of both a Protestant pastor, and admirer of Freud, who considered him an atheist and a relative who said whatever else he was, he was not an atheist.  Freud does not attempt to resolve that difference, as he so easily could have. I know of no evidence anywhere in Freud's writings that he ever committed himself to atheism, at least, if "atheism" is defined as denying the existence of God.  (Broader definitions are possible.)  I conclude that Freud's underlying disposition is not so much atheistic as irreligious.  I say "underlying disposition," but I could just as well say  "bias" or "prejudice."  Now let us consider what that disposition, which never is proven, but which is clearly manifested, implies.  Since no justification is offered in any rational manner, we must look for a pattern in what is said.  A rubric that covers not only everything in this book, but perhaps everything he wrote, is "illusion."  Perhaps that was Freud's Freudian sloppy slip.  For his irrational bias against religion can easily be explained as an infantile wish that religion, by which he would have probably thought of the Jewish faith and the Christian faith as they were represented in Vienna at the time, were not true.  He didn't want them to be true.    A further consideration is that in this book Freud gives no evidence whatsoever of having investigated,  or even being familiar with, the evidence and the reasoning of those who defend their own religious belief or the demonstrable proclivity of the human race to believe and practice or feel guilty about their failure to practice, some religion.  In this he is just an intellectual of his time, a time dominated by materialistic determinism in the name of science.  I agree with those who regard Freud as a great writer.  His prose carries the reader right along, until the absurdity of the ideas makes you want to throw up.  I first read Freud at the age of 22, ploughing my way through "The Interpretation of Dreams."  Even then I could see that he was subjecting all his empirical, i.e. clinical, evidence into the framework of a system of subjective categories, which at the very least were dubious.    Freud's scientific pretensions were an attempt, unconscious perhaps, to give prestige to his new ideas.  At the time science was riding high.  Marx, also, for instance, regarded his ideas as scientific.  And I do not mean to imply that Freud was not a good observer, nor that he was dishonest, just deluded by his illusions.  He founded a very influential cult, that has lasted until our own day, although it has never gained anything resembling general scientific acceptance.  Several of his earliest colleagues broke with him, the most important being Jung and Adler.  That is typical of cults, which cannot bear the weight of more than one dominant personality 
 One of the things I have enjoyed about Ketchum's works is how readable they are and Victory at Yorktown is no exception. That being said,I did not enjoy this work as much as I did his previous works.  One reason might be that I read Decisive Day, The Winter Soldiers and Saratoga before I knew much about the Revolutionary war, and I have read a lot of other books since then.  I didn't really feel as though I learned anything new in Victory at Yorktown.  It gives a brief account of the campaign in the Carolinas and Arnold's treason before delving into Yorktown. The description of the battle, and the Naval engagements prior to,  seemed to lack any emotion or excitement.  The personal accounts he provides are really the same ones that every other book about the revolution gives.  This could be a good book for those reading about the later stages of the war for the first time, however those who are well read on the subject may want to skip it. 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 I think this book could only appeal to people that love Scarlett O'hara.  Lucia Amato is an aspiring opera singer.  Lucia's single mother, Jennie, worked hard to give Lucia singing lessons.  Now, however, Jennie depends on her daughter to make a career and bring her reflected fame and fortune.  Lucia is sick of her mother's clinging and since her mother can do nothing to further her career, she turns to Martin Frazier.  Martin is an up-and-coming conductor who adores Lucia.  He helps to manage her career and singing skills.  Lucia sleeps with him in order to get better opportunities though Martin's connections.  As soon as Lucia gets her chance at stardom, she meets Constantine Zonar.  Zonar is a Greek shipping tycoon, separated from his wife, who loves Lucia for being an up-and-coming opera star.  Both of them are temperamental and Lucia's budding career suffers.  Lucia thinks to punish Zonar for his neglect by sleeping with her co-worker, Boris Nicolai, but the tables are turned when she discovers Zonar and Boris had been playing her all along.  Eventually, Zonar dumps Lucia, divorces his wife, and marries a rich, young socialite.  Lucia's career is ruined and Martin appears to help her put her life and career back together, so she takes Martin back as her lover.  Once again on the brink of stardom, Zonar appears ready to take her back.  Lucia finally realizes that Zonar has been trying to undermine her career all along!  So she stays with Martin.  Is that romantic or what 
 This book reduces Nietzsche to rhetorical devices and tropes.  Many out of control discussions are on hand, eventuating in nothing worth remembering.  The idea of this book seems to be to reinforce the idea that morality is boring, that no one should find thinking about morality interesting, and that if you just call boring prose dangerous, then it is.  The argument in this book goes all the way back to Paul Valery, Derrida's inspiration, who misunderstood Saussure.  Valery argues that philosophy has all the marks of literature, and so is indistinguishable from it, and so just is more literature -- no different from comic books, grafitti and wedding vows.  But Quine found no marks of science that were not to be found in philosophy, yet philosophy does not reduce to science.  The argument is no better from the side of art.  Philosophy does not reduce to art.  Valery was wrong, and so is the Magnus group 
 Do you know what you get when you combine porn with art?  Lousy porn and even lousier art.  Curiosity and some rapturous reviews brought me to Catherine Breillart's films, which I find so dismal I usually wouldn't bother to write about them.  But I find the intellectual acrobatics involved in elevating this type of fetishistic dreck into something someone finds profound most interesting and symptomatic of the exhaustion of both the art and the intellectualism that explains it.  Breillart's claim to fame is this marriage of full frontal, hard core porn with her particular intellectual conceits.  Here we have another demented Frenchwoman working out her "issues" while having her own very special vagina monologues with a gay man as the camera practically inserts itself in every orifice.  Wonderful.  I suppose everything worth doing has been done in art.  That is the only explanation for this bankrupt and disheartening work.  It isn't that anything is taboo or that the subject matter is off-limits. The male/female dichotomy and sexual relations have always been the subject of art. It is in the execution.  The films I've seen so far just aren't very good.  The use of shocking and graphic images here is not insightful, nor does it represent anything revolutionary.  They make no statement.  They don't breathe life into film, they breathe decay and decline.  This is the art of exhaustion and despair.  This is the graphic image for its own sake.  Breillart represents nothing more than the celebration of the mediocre.  The elevation of mundane rubbish to supposed high art. The never ending contest to out-sensationalize.  You could throw a fistful of crap against a wall, and someone would consider it brilliant.  Some of us, however, still see it as crap-on-the-wall.  A monkey can play with his dung, but he can't write a symphony or a sonnet, and if we exhalt the one, it must be to the detriment of the other.  I don't want to belabor this and ruminate too long on something that is, after all, only a movie that few people will watch, and fewer still will rhapsodize over.  I believe that this type of stuff wears itself out and is fairly quickly forgotten. There are only so many ways to shock and sensationalize.  Watching Breillart work out her fetishes on screen is recommended soley for the seriously bored.  The ugly, sordid, scatological, and perverse abounds in this life, and it doesn't take a lot of imagination to exhibit it.  The capture of elusive and ephemeral beauty, ah, now there's a trick.   
 This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional 
 ...clearly an argument that displays first a loyalty to a specific outcome, and then seeks a way to get there.    Rauch does well not to demonize the opposition, who, certainly, can be their own worst enemies when it comes to debating the issue, trotting out canned phrases like "family values," and "the sanctity of marriage."    Nevertheless, his assertion that allowing gays to marry will strengthen the instution misses the point entirely.  First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.    Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires.  His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No.  I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America.   
 I've not found anything from Memorex that works right, try Maxell products from Amazon, you can't find better products and the best customer service on the net. 
 The book is, for the most part, an author's attempt to rewrite the Vietnam War based on limited sources and questionable conclusions.  For instance, Eisenhower became a political leader and no longer remained in the military's inner circles.  George Marshall had become a relic and a number of political leaders opposed entry into Vietnam.  Buzzanco's flamboyant leftist ideology severely clouds his objectivity and his selection of sources.  How did his publisher, or his graduate committee for that matter, ever sign off on this work 
 How many times can I say pompous?   These authors have so inflated their egos that I can not imagine sharing a room with them.  I certainly would not want to share an office or any job with them.  The authors love "technology" - and that can be a good thing. However, they so completely mix up the means and the ends. In teaching a well educated student is the "ends" or our product.  Give me a tent and something to scrawl on and a good teacher will put out a good product: a well educated student.    Technology is a tool we can use.  Just like any other tool when people see someone using it, AND it improves the job in some manner they will switch over to the new method.   The emphasis on technology is wasteful.  All, yes 100%, of the information this book is devoted to can be picked up by anyone in a single semester course.  This is from a teacher who: always uses an electronic grade book, posts assignments and other information on my web page, has converted almost all of my lectures into PowerPoint presentations filled with pictures, QuickTime video shorts, links to current events in the news.  My students have assignments which require internet research.  Some of their assignments they can access from anywhere (on vacation in New Zealand!), at any time, with or with out partners, and can use a wide variety of resources.    My students score well on state tests, actually really well.  However, with no "technology" (a tent and some chalk and slates) they will still do well.  Let's not confuse the tools with the real job, and these tools are VERY easy to learn.   If it makes sense people will do it, use it - if not - they SHOULD not 
 me and my friend were looking everywhere for that song. thanks again for finding it and posting its name.  why in the world didnt they include it in the soundtrack.  anyways, good work melani 
 I was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year. a third of a way through it, it starting to skip and freeze. I played it all the way through but took forever. At the ending it was workinhg again., But I missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage. I guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used. Won't be doing this again!   
 I don't really care whether the book is "true" or not--although I doubt it is.  But despite a few well written sentences here and there, the stories are boring, the characters unsympathetic, and the setting mundane.  I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about.  There are tons of better books out there.  I don't recommend this one 
 The 1994 Blackstone Audio Book version of "Turn of the Screw" is read by Pat Bottino.  Mr. Bottino's uninspired presentation destroyed the story. Perhaps Mr. Bottino got better in later ventures, I don't know, but he mangled "Turn". Avoid this version at all costs 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous! 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 I've been a fan of the GGDs since the late eighties and was hoping that they would get back to their roots and start making great garage rock again but it seems they are just too old and now care more about sales instead of where they came from.  It's sad to see this happen to a good band, maybe they should talk to Trent Reznor and see how a 40 yr old guy can still rock 
 This album goes against pretty much everything Slayer has accomplished.  This is nowhere near as good as their earlier albums.  In my opinion this album is a waste of plastic.  Its ok to listen to when theres nothing else...but if you have some older Slayer laying around then thats what you should be reaching for.  This album is just too "Punk-Rockish".  All in all its just very UNslayer 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13  Put your faith in the bible and Gods words NOT THROUGH SHAKTI GAWAIN  Trust Jesu 
 One assumes that Goff intended this travesty of a book to provide a history of white gospel singing.  But, while constantly referring to white and black gospel as distinctive forms, he never establishes exactly what the differences are.  He instead pelts readers with a flurry of boring mini-biographies and social-conservative propaganda.  The reader gets a strong sense that Goff disapproves of atheists, homosexuality and abortion, but if the book was supposed to give a definitive account of a musical tradition, it fails 
 I read through this book and got amazed how the Indiana University even considered attaching its name to it. Because this is total falsification of the Georgian history and straightforwardly an INSULT to any person who has ever had any positive emotions towards Georgia. Don't waste your time, this book will mislead you 
 Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie.  I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already.  If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on.  People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me.  Was he mentally challenged or what?  I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;)  Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends 
 I thought this would be a referance book on electronic daytrading software and how to apply the information gleaned from it. The main point of the first 100 pages was to tell the different places I might find the information I expected to have been in the book. Then there are over 200  pages of appendices listing the different stock exchanges, a list of  compainies on the Nasdaq, etc. This would not have been worth the price if  it had been a five dollar paperback 
 I ordered this A/V cable for a client showing since I didn't want to carry extra baggage.  The cable arrived in time, but on plugging it in I found the cable damaged by a short in the video side.  Since, it only cost $20 bucks, I threw it in the trash and bought a more expensive cable at my local Radio Shack.  I'm sure if it worked I would continue to use it with my iPod, but alas it's history 
 This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 This may be the most overrated book in network marketing.  Don't get me wrong.  John Milton Fogg is a heck of a writer.  This "fable" is truly an extraordinary read, filled with wonderful images and seemingly heart-felt sentiment.  A page-turner, the reader whisks through the story of a novice networker's breath-taking encounter with the Greatest Networker in the World.  From a Japanese Restaurant to a hot bath to a baseball diamond to an opportunity meeting, the reader really believes that he (or she) is learning the secret to true networking success.  As such, this book has been heralded as the "classic" for the industry. (I must confess that I once was a believer.)  It's easy to come away from this book after a first reading thinking, "so this is what I'm missing."  Fogg has a gift.  The problem, however, is that there is nothing that Fogg presents that truly helps someone "do" the networking business, and do it well.  There is nothing written in the book that justifies the feeling of discovery that the first reading bestows.  Moreover, Fogg presents no authentic insight.  Instead, this book is empty.  It promises a "secret," almost Gnostic, knowledge of the inner-game of MLM, but never delivers.  It certainly leaves the reader hungry for more; but hungry because there was no food in the first place.  This book, instead, permitted Fogg to craft for himself a self-styled persona of "networking expert," with his finger on the pulse beat of the industry.  What Dexter Yager did with Amway, Fogg tried to do with the industry as a whole.  Take a look at his greatestnetwork community.  (Yager, to his credit however, actually built a downline.  I don't think Fogg can say the same.)  The Emperor has no clothes.  There is little, if anything, in this book which is new or thought provoking.  It gives the appearance of substance, but appearances are deceiving 
 This book is very dated. The instructions are okay if that's all you want, but style-wise this book is old, old, old 
 This is not the book you want to buy unless you are very small,or have a liking for using a magnifying glass  it is not the original, it is a very small copy that is only about 2 inches by 3" To be returne 
 The carver style of governance is a tad idealistic and perhaps overly optimistic.  I have read everything Dr Carver has written concerning this field and enjoy this material at an academic level.  But when it comes to  operationalizing this model in boardrooms I've seen it fail time and time  again.  Not to say that the model is flawed because in fact the model is  normative and conceptually complete.  However it doesn't capture that  element of reality from which, in my experience, the model requires -  practicality and real-world application.  Dr Carver's notion that Boards  can do without Finance and Audit Committees is very naive.  Most  consultants from the chartered accountant genre are saying the complete  opposite.  In fact most government policy initiatives are moving toward  more control of financial affairs of organizations for boards from charts  of accounts to fiscal policy.  So I don't think the elimination of Finance  and Audit Committees is realistic nor is it a terribly bright suggestion.   I guess my only crticism is that the carver model is far to idealistic and  philosophical for a practical application in the form Dr Carver suggests.   Sorry but a hybrid model of traditional Board governance and the carver  model may work given the commitment required from directors to  follow-though on everything suggested in that system of governance 
 I couldn't believe how bad this book was.  As a fan of the hardcore/punk scene in my teenage years I found almost the whole book to be unreal.  I was actually rooting for something bad to happen to Frank because 1)he started to annoy the hell out of me, and 2)I just wanted something interesting to happen.  The dialogue was totally forced and unrealistic and scenes tended to go on forever.  In spite of myself, I actually managed to finish it.  If your a serious reader, don't get this book.  It is aimed at the young teenage crowd that doesn't pick up a book to often 
 I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item, but just to warn others - I bought this because I wanted an ab bench.  It really doesn't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells.  The ab position is pretty weak and doesn't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have, plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said, if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over, get something else.  Combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable, it really won't make an impact on your workouts.  I did a few sets of situps and really don't feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter.  If you're on a budget, this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard.  The fact that it's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are ONE smooth incline, not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it's not supposed to bend LOL 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 The first movie was totally unexpected, had great music, including some original John Cafferty gems not written specifically for the movie and a cast that included Tom Berenger, Ellen Barkin and Emmy winner Joe Pantoliano.  This allowed it to make up dialog that was sometimes cringe inducing and sometimes wonderful ("Words and music, Wordman, words and music", "But we ain't great, we're just some guys from Jersey").  Make a second low-budget sequel, but lose 3 great cast members and use music written specifically for the film and you can't help but have problems.  Combine that with some poor artistic decisions:  A key dialog between Eddie and Tom Berenger on beach in the first movie is cut and spliced in a flashback that shows the dialog between Eddie and the bass player Sal.  First, Sal, now portrayed as Eddie's best friend was treated with nothing but disdain by Eddie in the first movie ("what are you, a moron Sal?").  Second, the day they shot the shots of Sal the weather was different than the original scene, so every time they show Sal's face the weather changes.  As a huge Eddie I fan, I'm glad I saw this movie just to see the resurrected Eddie Wilson.  As a movie fan there were times I found myself laughing out loud.  The second star in the review carries over from the classic original 
 I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started.  Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own.  It really is worse than when I started.  
 I really liked the first two Jak games, so I was excited to try Jak 3. Whoa. Major mistake. This game is nothing more than a lame racing-wannabe. I was very disappointed in this game. If you are expecting a platformer, look elsewhere 
 To me, this book was far too long for the plot. I became so bored just waiting for something to happen that I quit the book right in the middle; skimmed to the end to see who the killer was. The plot would have been a good one had she not drug it out so long 
 Being new to VB I expected this book to help me through the rough spots.  I am a embedded programmer who uses mostly assembly language, but wrote a fair amount of C programs on the PC using the old Borland 4.  I find that seeing some examples is my best way to learn.  You would have thought with 25 years of experience I could figure out how to code in VB.    Well, this book looks like some C++ I have seen, not like any basic I am familiar with.  Most examples look like cryptic C++.  Perhaps this is the way VB6.net is, and, if so, I should have bought visual C++ because I know C, just not C++.  I suppose the book is fine for experienced VB programmers, but I cannot recommend it as a highly experienced programmer 'trying' VB for the first time 
 Seriously, I didn't even think that this was a comedy until I came here and saw people saying "it wasn't funny."  I got it as part of a boxed set of Cary Grant films (purchased here), and it's the only dud of the lot.  There was one scene that, I will grant you, was light and entertaining.  Not laugh out loud, but funny enough (I won't spoil it by saying which one).  Aside from that, the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity.    Most of all, you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne.  Grant and Simmons, in particular, are strong - but their efforts are ultimately squandered.  Bob Mitchum is OK, but generally miscast, and Kerr's beauty and talent are basically wasted.  No amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here.  She goes from happily married to tramp in about 5 minutes, for no discernible reason.    Overall acting: C (Grant/Simmons: B) Directing: F Writing: D-  I understand that this film caters more to English tastes, and that's fine, but I found it most un-satisfying 
 If you know nothing about performance management this is your book. Simple, large letters, wide spacing and easy to read. A lot of general information together.  But if you are somewhat equiped in the field: don't buy this book. Not worth the trouble of buying. 
 FIX THE NETWORKING! SEE THE REVIEW WRITTEN BY THE OTHER PERSON WHO PUT OUT COMMENTS. THE TROUBLE AND PAIN YOUR READERS GO THROUGH WITH A BROKEN SETUP CAN BE A LOT!! The pain associated with installing Linux must be eased by buying these books not worsened 
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 Don't expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely boring.  The story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town's folk out of their claims. They do this through intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a claim, they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this, they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.  This production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.  Spaghetti westerns can be fun. This one, however, needs the Pepto Bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn. 
 If I could have given this book no stars I would have.  It was a complete waste of money and time.  Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman.  I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have.  Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan.  I've read my last book by Bacall 
 I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, "DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson." This most difinitive "unproven" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he "seems" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what "reason" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.    From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. "Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study.   He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of "authority" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, "Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)." His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct.   He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, "Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, "Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, "The Jefferson-Hemings Myth" are available through Amazon.   I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy......."Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve." I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of "another" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

 I had worn out my copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs so I thought I would try something new.  Bad decision.  There are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really don't feel one exercise before you move on to the next.  In addition, you really need to buy the "Firm Sculpting Stick" to make many of the exercises work, which I found insulting and rather marketing-minded.  I am sending this back 
 I have purchased many books on the U.S. Constitution. This book was okay,  but compared to others it only deserves one star. My two favorite books  which I would give five stars are The U.S. Constitution for Everyone, and  The U.S. Constitution & Fascinating Facts About It. Read the reviews  for those books and you'll see that many people share my opinion 
 According to this book, here are James Patterson's 7 Golden Rules of Writing:     1. Write simple sentences. Don't use big words or describe people wearing colors other than black or "power blue."    2. Dialogue should be monotonous. Have your characters say the same thing over and over. Especially the hero. He has to bemoan his life yet cheer himself on in the next breath, reminding himself how great he is. Over and over. Bemoan, cheer, repeat! If that doesn't work, have other people say the same thing. Bemoan, cheer, repeat!    3. Keep your chapters short. Three pages is pushing it.    4. Take a subculture -- like goths -- and exploit them in the most obnoxiously ignorant way. Use the real names of their clubs in Los Angeles, and make sure every person depicted is a lunatic, a drug addict, or both. Get everything wrong, even if getting it right would make your story more complex and interesting. Don't even try to understand said subculture. They won't know! They'll never read your book, anyway!    5. Don't worry about the accuracy of anything you write. Geography, culture, language -- it's fiction! You can do what you want!    6. Kill a lot of people.    7. Make your villians go to Vegas. No reason. Just get them there. You've got to write off that trip to Vegas for your taxes somehow...  Wow! I'm ready now to write a commercially successful thriller. It'll take about a month.  But please shoot me first 
 I've always liked Stephen King's books, but this one didn't quite do it for me. The story premise was interesting, but I just didn't get into the heads of most of the characters. Those I did identify with in most cases didn't survive to the end of the book. King does evoke a strong sense of setting, and Castle Rock is definitely a town I'll be happy to visit in other books. Since it's the last of the Castle Rock books, and not very strong, I wouldn't recommend it as a good place to start when reading King's books 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Pym's Excellent Women and Quartet In Autumn.  However, I was just unable to find anything humorous about a middle-aged college professor's foolish seduction attempts with a young, female student of his.  It's not funny, it's pathetic and banal.  Why is thirty-six year Jessie portrayed as an over-the-hill old maid yet the handsome curate of precisely the same age ends up with a nineteen year old, youngest daughter of Lord Somebody at the end of the story?  It's an old-fashioned plot that hasn't stood the test of time.  I thought the curate's matrimonial choice demonstrated shallow regard for money, youth and beauty.  It became too much, the clash between gossiping, nasty-minded old women versus the horny old men striving to demonstrate their virility.  Did my mother-in-law write this?  The attitudes expressed in this tedious tale had none of the sincere wit of Jane Austen and none of her sympathetic characterizations.  Was I supposed to identify with Jessie?  She was the only character with any indication of a thoughtful, sensitive introspection yet she ended in the same dreary spot, still in a position of humiliation, on a bleak day, as part of the furniture 
 Big Weather?  WRONG!!!!  This guy covers philosophy, map making,religion, his philosophical ideas to the point of nausea, old world history, pages & pages about Mary MacLane, oh yeah, and almost as an afterthought there are some pages about weather & chasing.  But still laced with his philosophy. NOT a book for anyone except maybe self styled "intellectuals 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 "Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU 
 This book doesn't help if you're struggling with a toddler too young to really communicate rationally with.  The chapters go from introducing solids to babies under the age of one, to dealing with toddlers at least 2 years old.  That crucial time between 12 months and 2 years is neglected and there is no help for picky eaters you can't negotiate with.  You can't ask a 17 month old to "try one bite", or explain to him that if doesn't eat now, that's it, because after this it's bedtime.  The book has a good point about parents deciding when and what to eat, and the child deciding if and how much he'll eat, but when you're dealing with a young toddler and communication is limited, and negotiations are impossible, the author falls short in giving helpful advice or even acknowledging that this is a difficult stage 
 There's an old saying that you can't judge a book by it's cover. I don't do that. On the other hand, I judge Christmas books of this type by the accuracy of two things -- the story of "Silent Night" and the information about St. Francis of Assisi and Nativity scenes.   Unfortunately this book fails the test on both counts.   Regarding the popular carol "Silent Night," the book states: "Finding himself without a functioning organ for the Christmas Eve service, Father Josef Mohr scribbled down some verse and asked his organist Franz Gruber to quickly score it for voices so that the choir could sing it for that evening's Midnight Mass." The book's author calls it a "slap-dash creation."  It's very easy to check the real history of this carol through the website of Austria's Silent Night Society. They can be regarded as the keepers of the history of "Stille Nacht."  Joseph Mohr wrote his six-stanza poem in 1816. There's no way anyone can say for certain that it was slap-dash and there is no way to know how much time he spent on his poem. What we do know is that he didn't give it to Franz Gruber until 1818. Two years later. Hardly slap-dash.   Mohr asked Gruber to write a melody with guitar accompaniment but there are no records to indicate that the organ was not functioning. Mohr and Gruber sang the six verses of the carol with the choir repeating the last two lines of each verse. Thus, it's not exactly correct to say it was scored for the choir. They were merely used as background echo for the voices of the two men with Joseph Mohr playing his guitar. I've been to Austria and held Gruber's "Stille Nacht" manuscript in my hand and pay close attention to everything written about the world's best-loved carol.  Pages 290, 405, and 408 of this book, have sections that deal with St. Francis of Assisi. The book's author tells that he created a manger scene "using real people and animals." It gives the impression that there was an elaborate scene with people representing Joseph, Mary, shepherds, etc.  The biographers of St. Francis were Thomas of Celano and St. Bonaventure. Both men wrote about that incident at Greccio and the English translations of their writings are readily available.  St. Francis had a real ox, a real donkey, and a feeding trough (manger) at Greccio. That's all. He celebrated Christmas Mass using the manger as the altar. There were no people to represent Joseph and Mary. There were no people representing shepherds. There were no people to portray Magi.   Since I have no way to check everything in the book, the misinformation regarding "Silent Night" and St. Francis at Greccio leads me to distrust other information in the book. I'm very disappointed and had hoped to share this book with friends. I e-mailed my findings to the publisher. 
 When I read the original "5 languages of love" 3 years ago, it changed the way I related to the important people in my life. I also learned how to ask others to show their love in a way I could understand. So, when I saw that Chapman had written a book for singles, I ordered it immediately. I couldn't be more disappointed. While the original book presented sound and common-sense psychological research and insights, the newer "singles" book has devolved into far-right Christian dogma. While the original book was 'descriptive', telling one how to show love in a way one's mate could understand, the new book is 'prescriptive', demanding that one have "wholesome" relationships according to ultra-conservative Christian sensibility. The section on "loving touch" repeats over and over that sexuality is to be expressed only within the bounds of marriage, a view that won't help the majority of possible readers. Even if you're single, skip this disappointing book and find the original in a used bookstore 
 Most of the issues that the author describes are the same as for any biological child.  For example, The parents are trying to live through the child, and put their own goals onto him/her.  (Who doesn't know biological families like this??)  The child is a perfectionist and tries to please everyone, becoming unhealthily obsessed with being "good."  (Again, we all know children like this, whether adopted or not; the high schools are full of them).  The author takes her experience (adoption in the 1940s) and assumes that things are the same today.  Very few adoptive parents today would lie to their children, pretending that they had given birth to them.  This is 2006!  This book MIGHT be good for people in middle age who were adopted as infants-- assuming that they are still interested in deconstructing their childhoods 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as "authoritative" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. "Man's Search For Meaning" is a FAR more compelling leadership read... 
 I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series. Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills?  Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years! Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise.  But....that logo is really annoying 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 This book held a lot of good information as a reference volume, but it made for VERY dry reading.  It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed.  It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters.  I find that by the time I get to a second mention of a myth or regional story, I've forgotten what I read about it in a previous chapter!  It is especially not a good book for a beginner just trying to get an overview of older pagan traditions 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 Phillips book is flawed on a fundamental level.  As he works through his arugement he not only essentializes and trivializes the work of ecologists and ecocritics alike, he goes at them from a perspective wholly foregin to their own.  Phillips seems to be trying to play the role of the disillusioned environmentalist, yearning for a better, more equitable ecocritical paradigm, but in his self professed attempt to "philosophize with a hammer," he comes off instead as trying to completely undercut the ecological values and aesthetics of the Green Left.  He takes pot shots at everyone from Muir and Thoreau to Lopez, Dillard and Ammons.  Constantly crying foul at their lack of objectivity, Phillips argues that ecocritics should take on more of a scientific approach, and abandon the world of the spiritual, aesthetic and mystical. His attack at, what he considers to be, the cliche of the "ecological epiphany" is particularly barbed, as is his attack of Dillard's sense of the mystery and awe she feels when confronted with the Blue Ridge Mountains (he does quite a number on her "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek").  In the process of dismantaling the ecocritical aesthetic Phillips aligns himself with Joyce Carol Oates in trivializing the "REVERENCE, AWE, PIETY, MYSTICAL ONENESS" that characterize ecocritical responses.  In one of his attacks Phillips questions whether "any sense can be made out of" Andrew Pickering's assertion that "the claims that the Earth circles the Sun and that it rests on a stack of turtles were of equal validity."  At this point I should have stopped reading, because it should have become clear that Phillips is someone who just doesn't get it.  Clearly he is confusing facts with truth, mysticism with positivism, and in asserting that there is some fundemental problem with this statement he is revealing himself is an enemy of the ecocritical project. Clearly ecocriticism, being a young field, is in need of maturing, and admittedly Phillips points out some real problems in its application, but he falls into trap of cutting down the field without sewing new seeds or seeing to the fertility of the ground.  Clearly the values that Phillips has brought to the table are so fundamentally different from the ecocritics that he deems to speak of that they can never be reconciled.  I will however throw Phillips a bone and point out that he does admit to being unapologetically argumentative, though I'd say dismissive would be more accurate 
 If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published 
       I thought this product was going to be easier but i have found it really dosent work the tape dosent like to stick to your skin and i think the sizes are off i wear a 38C and so i got it its like whereing a b cup not a c  well i hope this info helps people              Sher 
 The strength of this work is that it covers all of the New Testament sources of the resurrection narratives, meaning Paul's letters as well as the canonical Gospels.  There is also an appendix that discusses the resurrection appearances in some of the apocryphal gospels. Fuller is obviously competent and familiar with the material.  He finds redactions, exaggerations, conflations, and invention at every turn.  In fairness, though,  he also reaches conclusions more traditional, such that Luke had an independent source beyond Mark, that the Emmaus Road Story is based on earlier tradition, and that at least the report of the empty tomb by a women or women is historical.  The greatest weakness of this book is the leaps that Fuller takes to reach conclusions that will appear to the reader as speculative, at best.  The book has less than 200 pages of text.  There are sentences that should be paragraphs and paragraphs that should be chapters and chapters that could easily be books.  As a point of comparison, Raymond Brown takes 1500 pages and two volumes to cover the death and burial of Jesus.  This does not mean that Fuller is always wrong, just that he often provides insufficient information and discussion for us to form an opinion one way or the other.   One example is Fuller's conclusion that the "third day" reference in 1 Corinthians 15 "is not a chronological datam, but a dogmatic assertion."  Why the disciples would have found "on the third day" to be dogmatically necessary is gleaned from much later  apocalyptic writings in the Talmud.  But not only are these sources much later than the resurrection narratives, they are not discussed or even cited (Fuller provides a secondary reference).  Nevertheless, Fuller assumes that these apocalyptic beliefs about the significance of the "third day" must have been powerfully active during the time of Jesus.  So powerful that the early Christians had to invent a reference to "on the third day" to meet that expectation.  But apparently not powerful enough to have left any contemporary evidence of its existence.  This seems unlikely and needs much more evidence than is cited.    I do not mean to impugn Fuller.  After sweeping away the possibility that there was a historical event that prompted the tradition, he had little choice but to come up with an alternative--no matter how unsupported.  Of course, his discussion of why there could not have been a historical prompting for the tradition rests on his assumption that early Christians would not have seen the discovery of the empty tomb and the beginning of the resurrection appearances as indicating the day Jesus was resurrected.  I disagree and think at the very least the point merits much further attention.  Certainly it would be reasonable for the apostles to conclude that Jesus' resurrection occurred within the same time frame as the empty tomb being discovered AND the beginning of the resurrection appearances.  Fuller also ignores the reports that Jesus referred to the destruction of the temple and its being rebuilt in three days.  This tradition is attested by two traditions (Jn. 2:19 and Mark 14:58; 15:29) so it is not so easily dismissed.      In addition to a simple lack of sufficient discussion, part of the problem seems to be Fuller's apparent assumption that any tension between the accounts can only be explained by authorial redaction.  He also sometimes views the literary evidence as a closed universe.  For example, because Paul only lists resurrection appearances without supplying narratives, Fuller appears to conclude that the narratives later grew out of the lists.  I find this rather unlikely.  Some of the appearances in Paul never found there way into a narrative and other narratives, though preexisting the gospels, have no detectable source in the list.  Additionally, Paul is expressing a creedal statement, useful in preaching and in letter writing.  But it seems more likely that the list was distilled from known stories about the resurrection appearances.  After all, the leaders of the church had actually experienced these appearances themselves (Peter, James, Paul, the Twelve, and the Apostles).  Not nearly enough attention is given to the dynamic of how these witnesses would have shaped the development of the narrative traditions.  Paul lived at least as late as 62 CE.  James too lived into the 60s.  Though we have less information about Peter, he too seems to have lived into the 60s. (Not to mention the Twelve and the other apostles).  All of them were continuously active in the church as leaders of the young movement.  Would they have really left such little imprint on gospels written only 5-15 years later?  I am skeptical.  But again, the issue deserves much more attention than it gets.    Overall, an informative read with some insights and good discussion.  But ultimately more useful for pointing out the issues than resolving them.           
 If you are after the egg rings, forget it. Your eggs leave their edges in the rings.  As for the bacon press, good grief, how can you mess up a flat piece of iron with a handle 
 I was really very disappointed in this CD it wasn't what I though it was. I would not reccommend this CD to anyone 
 Like all the new Star Wars books and movies that are comming out -- it's all joined foces with every Clech'e that's ever existed in the Science fiction realm.  It's all canned.  It's all fake.  It's all predictable, and I can't believe George Lukas allowed his series to be so terribly brutalized.  Star Wars sucks now 
 I think those readers who are interested in erotic stories may find the selections in this audio tape a bit "technical" sounding.  The terminology used fell short of my definition of eroticism.  I would pass on  this selection 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague 
 This  is one extremely ponderous book to read.  The author makes several well intentioned points, only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness.  Read it if you must....be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have 
 Do not read this book! It has useless and stupid information. The very little important information would be common since to most people who have ever gone to school. I strongly recommend that you don't read this book. I'm a christian and I still do not think it is a good christian book. If you like coffee, cokes, tv, music, etc. then you shouldn't read this book. It will tell you that it is wrong for you do these things. Please do not read this book! 
 This book made me feel dirty as a womyn. I found it insensitive, uninspired, and inaccurate. Anyone who wants true scholarship should look elsewhere for truth. There were, of course, many Goddesses in herstory,  however to deny them their individual importance with a pseudo-intellectual  monotheistic interpretation makes us no better than the men we must  educate. It is time for synchronism, not separatism 
 This is a reasonable light that certainly does a good job of making you visible to motorists.  I would agree with the reviewer about brightness - it is not really bright enough to use as the only source of illumination.  For me the most disappointing factor is the 'no tools' fitting strap.  It grips poorly on glossy surfaces - like many handlebars, for example! I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this.  Worse, the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use.  The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality.  Pros - Good light for sodium lit city streets - Really waterproof - Solid case  Cons - The 'no tools' strap simply sucks. - You'll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride.  Not really worth the investment.  I bought a cheaper 5-led light - with a proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - that I am far happier with.  The CatEye is now an expensive spare flashlight. 
 Heres the deal - I was told that if I liked South Park, I would like this record and that was definitely not true.  I like South Park and the Parker/Stone films "Baseketball" and "Orgazmo" but I  think this album sucked.  This is an album of crappy music that uses the  success of South Park to sell it.  The only thing I really liked on the  album was the Theme and the Eric Cartman song.  The Chef stuff was somewhat  funny but it was burned out after a few songs.  The music that was  supposedly influenced by South Park is all recycled garbage thats been  heard a thousand times before.  They also put some of the worst bands and  rap artists on this.  Take my advice and listen to it first.  You'll be  surprised at how unfunny it is and how little it has to do with South Park.   P.S. Look into the new South Park movie, Baseketball, and Orgazmo  soundtracks for better music and laughs 
 Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available. I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.  I was disappointed by the book "Photographic Composition" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:  1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain: - how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other,  - the reverse perspective effect and its uses, - why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice, - how to balance "weight" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example, - difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other) - all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements) - and much much more.  2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.  3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.  4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.  OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained "how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.  I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!  P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "Fotografiya kak..", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full 
 Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring 
 Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.  My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.  I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around. 
 This is supposed to be an advanced book.  If I was looking to learn how to put on a c-collar or a KED I'll buy the BTLS book and take that class.  This is supposed to be part of an EMT-P curriculum.  If a paramedic student does not know these things they should be looking elsewhere for a career.  Take the space given for these basic skills and put in some realavent information for advanced providers.  Keep this topic interesting and challenging instead of wasting time with basic first-aid and first responders skills.  We know this stuff! Now we want more!  Everything aside from the waste of time and paper on the basics is actually really great information.  I just want more of it 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 I am a member of Christians for Biblical Equality and my preferred term for myself is Biblical Egalitarian.  As Wayne Grade chooses to use the term "Evangelical Feminist" to describe my beliefs while I do not, I can with similar justification claim that I see him as a member of Christians for Biblical Patriarchy; for that is exactly what he sees the Bible teaching, male rulership (which is what patriarchy literally means) in home and church, what he calls 2 point complementarians (apparently as patriarchy has negative connotations and so resorts to euphemism to make his ideas more appealing).  The author proves that it is possible to read the Bible throughout using a male-preference bias, in effect seeing the Bible through a "blue" lens. He has collected every shred of evidence he can find to proclaim that the Bible has a "blue" tint on essentially every page.  One recalls that kings and their cohorts read the Bible using a "purple" lens and purportedly showed that there was a divine right of kings and that white slaveholders read the Bible using a (racist) "white" lens and purportedly showed that God intended blacks to be slaves.  He is wise enough to claim that the blue tint does not extend to polygamy, which he sees as sin, without explaining how so many of God's faithful could be polygamists.    He does promote a benign form of patriarchy (for which I am glad), but again this recalls ideas of being a benign king or a benign slaveholder.  In Western Democracies, either there is no royalty or it is a (wealthy) figurehead and there are no slaveholders.  We now see that the Bible does not teach being a benign slaveholder, it teaches not to be a slaveholder at all.  In order to see this clearly, one does need to wade through some proof texts that slaveholders used as justification; but we all realize today it can be done.  It is significant that the largest denomination that is 2 point complementarian is the Southern Baptist Convention, which formed in 1845 over the issue of being a Christian and a slaveholder, and for which (thankfully) they repented in 1995.    He provides a service to Biblical egalitarians by taking them to task when they slip up.  Iron sharpens iron.    Even though patriarchy has been around for thousands of years, was the dominant paradigm during Bible times, and is still a dominant paradigm in much of the world today, he sees any alternative to his patriarchal understanding of the Bible as a slippery slope to theological liberalism and secularism.    This is an area where one simply MUST study both sides if one is to be a Berean.  If any readers here wish to do this, I have some recommendations:  [...]  Finally, as some husbands may not be as benign as suggested in this book, here is a way for a wife to Biblically avoid obeying her husband who believes in Biblical patriarchy.  She can simply say that to comply with his request would be sin for her as she cannot do it in faith and she must obey God rather than man.  If the husband is truly following Biblical principles, he knows that anything not done in faith is sin.  He can try to convince her it is not sin, as might her pastor, but if she is willing to let herself be called weak in faith there is really nothing that they can do to force her to change.  
 In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis.   Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing "inductivism" by "deductivism." In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results.   But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier.   The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.  Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.  Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used.  
 The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details) 
 Well I now have a handle for my $250 I-Pod Nano. The arm snug would be a great idea if they maybe thought about who is probably going to buy this product and what they are going to be doing. First off I have to wear this arm band just short of the largest setting on my forearm because even at the largest setting it makes my arm fall asleep from lack of blood flow. So unless you are a skinny 140lb biker this probably won't fit you comfortably. The second issue is that there is not a locking mechanism for the strap so when I am working out with my muscles constantly contracting it just changes the strap size and I end up with my Nano on my wrist.   	Over all, this product is great if you are riding a bike or doing anything that doesn't cause you to move your arm a lot. So if you if you are planning on buying this for relaxing bike ride through the country it is well worth it. Planning on using your I-Pod to play angry music to help give you the strength do that one extra rep, don't bother. 	Bullet proof shield though is a must since those little screens get scratched so easily.

   	  Like a few others, I'm commenting on your comments. WHY does ANN COULTER produce a LUKEWARM response by you all? Many reviews are approved )or disapproved) by a slim margin -- one third to one half. Hardly ANY reviews of her books (i've looked at others)are either universally liked or disliked. What gives? NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.) In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's "The Greatest Story ever Sold," which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents. Most of the reviews of his book are overwhelmingly approved or disapproved by 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. Ann Coulter produces lukewarm responses. Frank Rich provokes fervid love or hate. Can somebody explain this for me?????? 
 After reading this book I've decided to write a book called: No More Blackness "How the Hip-Hop Culture moved back to Africa. 
 ...but that's where this one went. I've never read a more poorly written, sycophantic, piece of embarrassing drivel than this "biography" of Doris Day. The archaic, obseqious style is neauseating and could never have been authorized by Ms. Day, I surmise, if the sweet little octegenarian weren't a little dotty herself, making her and this "author" very compatible. If you are the least bit literate and hate wasting money, move on 
 What so many other reviewers are saying about the slavish similarities to--and sometimes outright copying of--Lord of the Rings are right on the mark. True, Brooks dresses his world up differently, and adds few original touches (some of which aren't bad), but in the end this story simply fails to deliver anything new or even anything worth the time it takes to get through the 700+ pages of poorly-wrought prose. As John Gardner once said, it takes an authentic junk mind to write junk fiction, and the poor quality of the sequel bears testimony that Brooks doesn't improve a great deal after his debut novel.  It's a pity, really, because Brooks's conceit of placing his fantastic tales in the far future might have provided a counterpoint to Tolkien's placing his own stories in the distant past. The races of man Brooks invents (apparently "human" is different than "man") have some potential, but they just slip into the silliest stereotypes as soon as they appear on the page. The world his characters inhabit looks large on the map, but apparently it can be traversed without any great difficulty on foot in less than a week. I got the sense that Brooks is the kind of person with a lot of ideas but without the tools to make them work. J.K. Rowling does a much better job juggling her multitudinous creations.  As mentioned earlier, I did go on to read the sequel, "The Elfstones of Shannara," based on the insistence that Brooks gets better as he goes. Maybe that's true 10-15 novels down the line, but "Elfstones" is even weaker than the first novel, probably because he made up the plot himself rather than stealing a better plot from a better writer. Don't bother with either one unless you have low standards and a lot of time to kill 
 ﻿ Books like this are what give screeds their bad name.  The "hit piece", character assassination nature of the book gives itself away in the first alleged "error". Limbaugh says "I hate to talk about myself, but..." and then uses the word "I" too many times to suit the author. There are no less than two problems with this allegation.  The first is the fact that "I" is the most frequently used word in the English language. It's the context in which it appears that determine whether or not the speaker is talking about himself.  As for the second problem, well, Mr Rendall, I used to watch Limbaugh's TV show, and one night he made that statement. With a smirk. His audience laughed, something mind-numbed robots don't do (I mention this because the far left, which includes FAIR, loves to call Limbaugh's audience "mind-numbed robots" -- perhaps there's some "audience envy" at work here?).   You see, Mr Rendall, Rush is kidding -- that's right, kidding -- when he says, "I hate to talk about myself, but..."   And, if you've really listened to Limbaugh and watched his TV show as much as you say you have, you knew that.  You _had_ to have known that.  But you didn't tell your readers, did you?  The rest of the "errors" turn out to be honest misstatements, typos, or differences of opinion.  The book ends with a pre-addressed post card readers can use to harass Limbaugh by mail.  So where's the "fairness & accuracy" in this book 
 I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again 
 A confusing and, in the end, an unsatisfying read.  Susan, the (now) adult daughter of a couple who have long since passed on, goes back through diaries, letters, and other things to sort out for herself (it seems) the day in Wales when her mother died (or was killed?).  While the potential was there to give us a romping good mystery, Davis gets the reader all glopped up with unnecessary dialogue and seemingly missing information in our efforts to understand what is happening.  The story surrounds two American couples, (with long sordid pasts with each other) the husbands are business partners, who take a trip to Wales for a walking tour of the region.  There are other characters involved, a couple of single women, the couple who runs the tours (and the B&B where they are all staying), etc... but they are put forth in an unsatisfactory manner.  Finally, there is a very vague undercurrent that suggests that Susan is living in some sort of anarchic or fascist state as, perhaps (we never know) a result of the computer work her father and the other man did.  In any case, I agree with one reviewer of this novel who said, it might have been saved with some editing.  I found it very hard to follow 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails

 First, the print quality is very good.  When it does work, it seems to work very well.  I was pleased with the print quality and features, and the print speed is excellent.  But the real problem is the extremely unstable software.  More than half the time, I could not start a scanning operation without it failing.  And when it fails, it really fails, and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer (that's right - the power button won't turn off the printer power when this happens), AND restart the computer which was the target of the scan output.   Since I normally do a fair amount of scanning, this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer, just to do a simple scanning job.  The printing software was also iffy, although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software.   Probably 10% of the time, a print job would not complete.  The HP Image software which came with the printer was a very useful and straight-forward photo-processing tool, which I would recommend for the most part.  HP chose, however, to ignore all the normal Windows software conventions, (like having a File and Edit menu at the top of the screen), so you are always having to hunt around on-screen for what you want to do.    Bottom line:  I hate playing the "print/scan lottery", wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work, each time I try to print or scan something.   This is not a finished product, and I strongly recommend buying something else 
 I have always been impressed with the man T.S. Eliot but I cannot say the same about his biogrpaher, Lyndall Gordon.  This book made my eyes go buggy and released the bats in the bellfry of my brain!  I read this book when I was very sick and it was a very poor choice to say the least.  I found her writing style thick with euphemisms, abrstractions, and other vague notions.  Very little is mentioned about the man Eliot himself!  What a ridiculous concept for a biography.  She includes far too many segments of his poetry that only make sense in context.  She spews them all over the book and leaves the reader wondering aloud, "Say what?".  Though this book has a marvelous, intriguing cover it has nothing but blurry accounts of the man, T.S. Eliot.  Find another biographer and you will be better off 
 You all are right.  The ink is where they get you.  It doesn't even last a semester.  It's cheaper to print my papers at the library than at my house 
 Ok, so it's not a great book.  Yet, it isn't quite as bad as the other reviews would lead you to believe.  The style (use of flashbacks, 3rd person omniscient VP, etc) is entertaining, though difficult to write.  It can be tedious, but ultimately you care enough about the characters to complete the book.  So why the bad reviews?  Simple enough.  The lead character, Jamie, is not particularly likeable.  Bad enough that he has little-to-no moral compass, but he has got to have the world's worst learning curve.  Just when his vampire-mentor decides to play nice and take him on a cruise, he gets soused and carouses with two women - motivated to join him by who-knows-what.   Just doesn't make sense, and it doesn't ingratiate him to all those female readers out there.  There seems to be a trend in popular literature to make really, really unlikeable narrators.  I can think of a dozen or more examples.  I suppose in a high brow fashion this is an admirable challenge to a writer.  Unfortunately, every book needs characters that readers like (or at least can identify with) in order to care about/like what they are reading enough to finish it and hopefully review it favorably.  Ironically, this is the strength of Hinton's YA work - even if you don't like Dallas Winston, you can understand why he is who he is.  That element is missing with Jamie Sommers.  You don't like him, and there just isn't enough there to excuse away all his errors 
 I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Buchanan's witty prose and charming dilect. He is obviously skilled in "spinning a good yarn" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries 
 Before my review, I'd like to ask what 'punk' is? Good Charlotte never qualified as 'punk'. I don't think a 'punk rock' band likes to host MTV's TRL. It's pathetic. I gave this CD a listen because someone suggested it to me, what a waste of an hour that was!! They don't even sound like the same people who sang "Little Things" or "Fesitival Song". (Yes, I did enjoy their first album) And what's up with the window-breaking high notes? I never did think that this band could sing well, but now that I've heard this album, WHOA! These boys cannot sing to save their lives. Good Charlotte hasn't done much to boost my interest in them, let alone my confidence that they could one day become this great band. Spend your time listening to music actually worth listening to like Britney Spears, *NSYNC, or even Aaron Carter... anything is 100% better than this garbage 
 Has everyone gone insane?  As an English teacher who has taught this novel for a couple years, I was looking for a little something more faithful to the novel than the original version. Hah!  This piece of trash is the worst version of a classic novel I've seen in 20 years of teaching. There were approximately three moments in the movie that actually had to do with the text, and I'm sure that was purely accidental. The monster is a gangster, Frankenstein looks like one of the Spartans in The 300, Elizabeth is a deranged emo, and Clerval has been relegated to to role of idiotic womanizer. When the credits rolled at the end and I saw that Branagh had directed this film (he who created the most watchable, beautiful, and textually accurate version of Hamlet ever), I thought I may as well burn myself on a funeral pyre (one of the few textually accurate details in this horror of a film).  Here's the deal - don't waste your time. Read the book. Byron and Shelley were right - Mary had somehting going with this story - too bad Branagh forgot to read it 
 Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who "invented" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has. The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.   
 original? please. uninventive. the vampire hunter. the vampires taking over. same old, same old. and if you don't have a story, don't write. a good story be chetwynd-hayes. not so bad by Barker. other than that..... Like to add that i don't hate vampires. i just hate recycling, vampire clans, so-called exciting intrigues, and melodrama 
 Sure, this calculator does lots of really neat stuff. It would be impossible to give a rating based on the features. Either it does what YOU need it to do, or it doesn't, like any other tool.  However, I can rate subjectively, and this thing is subjecting my head to a ROYAL headache!! The LCD viewing angle has been designed so that you only get good contrast when viewing it at a very weird angle - exactly the WRONG angle if you are in a room with overhead lighting or brightly colored walls. In order to get good contrast you must be looking at the LCD screen at such an angle as to make the LCD screen and the curvy faceplate reflect overhead lights, the ceiling, the walls, etc.  If you attempt to view the LCD screen head-on in an attempt to reduce these inevitable reflected light sources, and so that the characters on the screen are not stretched due to exaggerated perspective, or so that the buttons actually face your torso so they can be easily pushed (god forbid) the characters appear extremely (!!) dim. That is, the "contrast" is set all wrong, and I haven't found any way to fix it (a technology that was mature for hand-helds in the 1980s).  Now, if there is a way to fix the LCD contrast and I'm just ignorant about it, I'll gladly take the egg on the face to fix it and get rid of my headache. But I doubt it.  Then there's the hard cover. Like so many other calculators these days, it comes with a nasty hard plastic cover that increases the thickness by 30%, and also increases the width a bit. And of course to go without the hard cover leaves you with nothing at all for protection. The soft cover some other calculators come with is thinner, lighter, and takes less PLASTIC to construct. But as we see all too often in thousands of OTHER made-in-China products, the more plastic you can get the consumer to buy and carry around, the "better"...or something.  So, just like most calculators, the hard plastic cover 'works' but sucks and should be a separately purchasable option. And this perverted LCD viewing angle is almost prohibitively uncomfortable and the inability to adjust is beyond asinine.   These are SUCH EASY THINGS TO FIX - it's ridiculous that Sharp would put so much excellent functionality into such a miss-the-mark package. Where's QA on this?!?  Made in China 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 I don't understand what the people in charge of producing "The Wiz" as a film, could get by joining the former "BIG" names of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne in this trashy picture. The music soundtrack is by far, much better than the movie itself.  I have lately become a great Soul music fan, so I recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative Soul music work, not keeping in mind that it's a "movie soundtrack". In such manner you will enjoy it more!       
 This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  I had to buy it for a college course and I am furious that my teacher used this one.  It is totally unprofessional and too general. Not only myself but others have complained about the  boringness and also but find it completely useless. It reads like a high school essay project with unnecessary sarcasims, endless repetition and examples that are really very weak and inept in the explanations.  If you are seriously considering pursuing an interest in compensation and benefits, do not use this book. Teachers: don't put any other students through the aggrivation and insult.  We are professionals looking to advance our careers not waste what little time we already don't have.  It infuriates me that I had to pay so much for a book that isn't worth $13.00 never mind $103.00 
 The main character has the emotional depth of a saucer.  This was drug-fueled, NC-17 romp through DC that ultimstely leaves the reader asking 'What was the point?' She didn't learn anything from the experience other than how to milk fifteen minutes of fame for all it's worth. I read to the end hoping there would be an iota of character development.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  
 Please, I beg you, purchase one of her other books!  I have read nearly all of Aiken's works and they are FANTASTIC.  However, this book was very cut-and-dried, dull, and prejudiced.  The characters of the island people were so caricatured that it was borderline offensive.  No child deserves to have to read this book 
 When I ordered this book there was another book with a title that was almost identical, but it had a different cover so I ordered it.  Knowing there are an infinite number of crocheted squares, I thought I would be getting the ultimate in diversity.    As it turns out, I had ordered two books that were identical beyond the cover.   To add insult to injury, I had to wait 4 months for the second book.  I know publishers will often change covers and I have always thought of it as being deceptive and this was no different.  Somehow Amazon found out about this and the second book is not being offered any longer, but now I have to go through the extra time to return one of the books.  I am very disappointed in this practice 
 I love V.C. Andrews books, but Ruby and Melody were the ones that I hated the most. I hope that Giselle girl doesn't come after me, but if you do it's just my opinion. I thought that Ruby was a nice girl, but she kept on letting Giselle get her into trouble instead of fighting back like she should've. That showed that she was weak. I admired her for leaving from Paul after finding out that they were related, but I didn't even read the second book when I found out that they would get married. Bless V.C. Andrews's soul, but once she passed the ones writing her books have been ruining her name 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I thought this book was filled with cliches and did not find it helpful 
 I thought Silicon Valley was for smart people. A Stanford professor and a retired Cisco executive have managed to write one of the most indecipherable business tombs in recent memory. I was asked to review this book for graduate school and I found it mostly incoherent business babble. "Billiard Ball Management." "Shallowly Rooted Strategic Vectors." "Kinetic Structures Prevail." What kinds of business leaders talk like that today? I often find the best business books package challenging business problems with no non-sense solutions. Save your money. This book is a tower of babble 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.  She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.  Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, "Wow, this will fool 'em!" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery. 
 Cohen should read a dictionary before writing about ethics.  Self-promoting, and as is with most New York Times journalists, knowledge of subject matter and/or credentials for pontificating are sorely lacking 
 This was a complete waste of money.  A little phamplet of a book written by a very spoiled woman who is in love with herself more than anyone else 
 Based on my personal experience, I have a hard time buying into this persons process. While it was a good read, and Dr. West is a talented writer, I don't believe for one second that DID was experienced by him other than as an interesting writing tool 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 I was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 CD - same title as the book, and 1 DVD - Primal 3D Anatomy. The disks are highlighted on the cover, and described in intriguing detail on the back cover. BUT WAIT - inside the front cover, the last paragraph on another "highlight" it says "The second CD contains a 45-day free trial". The same note appeared on the disk but it was covered by the Notice to consumer. My conclusion was this misleading presentation WAS INTENTIONAL! Can't return it now because the disk seals are broken. The management at Lippincott Williams & Wilkins should be sent up the river in chains 
 This book is really a waste of time for anybody. It's a 400 plus page brochure on the new improved features of Windows Server. It doesn't explain how to do anything, simply introduces the new features. For someone familiar with Windows 2000, I would imagine they wouldn't want to sit there flipping through the 400 pages just to go "WOW", and for someone like myself, an absolute newbie to server technology, without any practical background on the subject, it all meant nothing to me. OK, Active directory now dooblats roaming profiles (?) eh? Yes, you get a 360 day copy of Windows 2003 to play with but it doesn't tell you how to play with it!  I find no redeeming features about this book. I should have read reviews before buying it. I mean, why buy advertising? I gave it 1 star so as to be able to post this review, as it doesn't allow zero. 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier 
 I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of "the problem". Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  Even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges.   However, the author fails to mention the "echo boom" (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  Both of these facts will "soften" the impact of the  "Gray Doom" that Mr. Peterson tries to create.  I just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  But  I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations 
 The major problem I have with this translation is the awkwardness of its language. There are long, unwieldy sentences with twisted syntax. Sometimes, the translation is obscure. For example: "...and the will of Zeus was accomplished/since that time when first there stood in divison of conflict..." Not every line is as bad as that, however. There are some passages that read fairly smoothly, and the last two lines of the fourth book stand out. The translation as a whole, however, mutilates the English language. There are better options if you would like to read the Iliad 
 The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents.  Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years.  But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life.  Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China.  And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2').  And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room.  [TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently.  'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases.  Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos.  These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.'  So how good is this film?  It depends on your expectaions.  'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious.  My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.'  But it's just my idea.  The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed.  The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing.  (Case in point.  You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.)  But  most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall.  I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story.  Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director.  (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb   says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!)  As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America.  Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back.  I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.'  'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.          
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big "is that it?" feeling. Skip it or borrow it 
 Sorry 'bout that pun!  It's difficult watching a group of amazingly talented actors try to make something out of this mess of a script.  Unfortunately Heather Morgan, who plays Lucy, wrote the screenplay and didn't do herself any favors.    The premise of a man watching his emotionally delicate wife's mental stability disintegrate to the point of where she recedes into life as a dog holds some promise, but it isn't fully realized here.  Secondary characters, particularly Lisa Kudrow as the veterinarian seem lost at sea.    There is something of the indulgent feel of an actor's improvisatory workshop at work here, a sort of "let's assemble a group of independently odd characters and place them into a collective situation."  With all of the characters wildly left of center there is little more than Lee Tergeson's slowly unhinging Peter to draw comparisons with normality to on the whack-o-meter.  Hank Azaria tries, but isn't given any meat to work with and his fairly large amount of screen time feels wasted.  How do you NOT use a talent like Azaria who pretty much livens up anything just by being there.   Evidently, this is how.  Heather Morgan actually makes the most of the role she's given herself and she veers from wildly annoying to earning this viewer's sympathy at her handling by the psychiatric/medical professionals.    Vincent D'Onofrio does manage to add another winner to his aresenal of misfits.  A brief bit with him playing Vivaldi on a harp is the highlight of the film.    Everyone gives there all and you want to route for them - Tergeson most of all - but an earthbound script keeps the entire thing from ever becoming anything special.  Too bad 
 No directions - these kids have to figure out what these cryptic codes mean without an instruction manual or any indication of what the buttons are for. The kids spent their own money on a cool toy.......they thought- do not buy unless you are a nuclear physicist 
 The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed 
 Nicholas Cage is incapable of bringing any reality to this otherwise very dark and serious story of a man becoming psychotically obsessed with thinking he is a vampire.  Cage used to make quirky movies good, Raising Arizona, but here his complete acting inability ruins a film.    The audience can see that his interactions with a vampiress and subsequent rampage, is what is called 'pyschotic delusions', but the film is brilliant when it shows that even Cage's conversations with his shrink may be imagined.  He is over the top and out of context.  Worst accent imaginable.  The concept of a man having an alternate universe, that may in fact be real, is not unique and runs through horror films- The Shining, Them, 12 Monkeys, etc, this film is a near twin of a classic- American Werewolf in London.  This is such a near miss though.  The murders and murder of an insane and suicidal man should be a very sad story, but Cage makes it hollow.   'Wolf' is somewhat of a remake, if 'remake' is to take a flawed film and find ways to make it worse.    If this is the journal of a madman, Cage seems to think he is in a comedy.    If it is a comedy, it is not funny 
 I can't recommend this book, which falls firmly in the category of works aimed at milking the purses of comics-artist wannabes.  It also teeters right on the edge of the stuff that seems driven by an urge to discourage potential competition from entering the field.  Plus it doesn't have any valuable info on penciling!!!  Mitch Byrd's "Notes to Draw From" is a better resource.  Klaus Janson has worked on some major DC titles and apparently also teaches at the School of Visual Arts.  Here he seems to be trying to pad out grudgingly little info on penciling with a sort of "why comics require super skills to draw" pedagogy that consumes more than 110 pages of an essentially 142-page book!  There's some good info in here I suppose, but the technical stuff always needs to be taken with a large block of salt.  No one ever became a great artist by studying art.  People become great artists by doing what they enjoy!  The way to become an artist is by creating art.  As you encounter challenges you look for solutions to problems and develop.  In that sense this book might be useful.  B-S- statements like "Drawing... requires study" etc etc do more harm than good IMHO.  The most important thing for would-be comics artists to remember is that the most successful guys in the field are Matt Groening and Scott Adams.  They didn't get to the top through their knowledge of anatomy!  Frank Cho is a brilliant draughtsman, but "Liberty Meadows" will never have the kind of circ "Doonesbury" had - back when Garry Trudeau was drawing little better than stick figures!  There are lots of books written from a viewpoint of encouraging young artists to learn while supporting them through their inevitable frustrations.  Look for those books before wasting your time with this 
 It only crushes one (!) ice cube at a time, which seems pretty foolish.  Perhaps if you're patient you'll eventually have enough crushed ice, but I found the design too frustrating 
 Jesus Christ is Yahweh.  Yancey doesn't understand that.  God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  God NEVER changes.  God is Holy Trinity.  God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity.  God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity.  God now is Holy Trinity.  When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity.  God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World.  Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament.  Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally 
 I chose this product because of its dual functionality as a bread box and slicer.  The bread box works great.  It fits our homemade 1.5-lb loaves fine and just barely fits a 2-lb loaf.  The holes are also just the right size to allow the breath to breath without drying out. The slicing 'rungs' are a different story.  I have a sharp bread knife and was hoping the rungs would help me learn to cut straight.  Well, the knife slices of small shreds of plastic from the sides and cuts into the bottom.  The plastic almost always ends up on the bread 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 I ordered Hamptons Magazine through Amazon.com back in October 2004.  I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive.    
 Weak forced dialogue, silly overly thought plot, unsympathetic characters, and unfunny and you have Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I saw a clip of Robert Downey accidentally audition for a part from this movie and thought it was going to be a funny movie about a mix up, where a crook gets to be come an actor solving a murder mystery.   Instead, I got a bunch of unwatchable nonsense with a unbelievable plot, uninteresting characters, forced unnatural over the top dialogue, an annoying Robert Downey, and a supposed love story subplot with zero chemistry. The movie is hard to follow which is why they have narration in the beginning, since this doesn't even resemble any film noir flick I have ever seen.  At the end I found myself feeling like I wasted 1 ï¿½ hours for characters I didn't care about and a plot I wasn't interested in, and the worst part is I didn't even laugh one single time. Robert Downey sums it up in narration at the end, "it's a dumb movie." He is right, and I don't understand anyone who thought this was actually a good movie. 
 Actually, This CD consists of 6 fine Irish instrumental pieces and 9 average pop recordings which are not at all complementary.  The title track's chorus, for instance, is repeated 17 times in just over 4 minutes & many other of the Corrs' own compositions included herein are equally inane and repetitive; so much so that I'm inclined to think that the Irish instrumentals subtrack from this album more than they add to it.  The pop songs could then just be accepted as conventional popular music then & we wouldn't be exposed to the disconnect that is apparent when we have the Irish instrumentals to compare to it.  Consequently, this CD feels like an album of the Chieftains randomly mixed up with something from the likes of Belinda Carlisle, Debbie Gibson, Shania Twain, or Brittany Spears.  If you are a popular musc fan, take your pick elsewhere & if you are looking for Irish music try sampling something from Sinead O'Conner (perhaps the CD, Sean-Nos Nua), anything from Enya, and/or something from Clannad.  Cheers 
 It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable 
 The training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well. I just don't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training. It is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks. It doesn't train you how to house train a puppy. It also doesn't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd. The dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips. Luckily you can skip these. I personally would not recommend this, but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning technique.Something else I did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals. I was able to teach my blue healer pup (Abby) to sit, lay down, come and heel in about 3 tries each. I liked the techniques, but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd.  
 In New York City, Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled wealthy immature young woman, living as if she were a princess in a fairy tale. Her father was a popular rock-and-roll guitar player, who died in a plane crash with Molly's mother when she was a little girl. On her birthday party in a nightclub, she meets Lorraine "Ray" Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a nasty young girl with attitudes of adult , living with her careless mother and a terminal father in a fancy uptown apartment. When the accountant of Molly vanishes with her US$ 100,000,000.00 inheritance, Molly is left with nothing but debts, and she needs to work to survive without having previous experience or any skills. She is hired to be Ray's babysitter, and their close contact makes Molly reach the maturity and Ray act like as a child of her age. The film's weakest link is the script, it simply isn't enough to hold your attention all the way through and descends into cliche-ridden moments which do nothing to emphasise the talents of the two leads. 
 For years, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Gael Greene's restaurant reviews in the New York Magazine. Her ability to rhapsodize, finesse, and romance dining experiences was  a weekly event I looked forward to savoring and "tasting" vicariously while living my MidWest-quiet life. However, although receiving very positive reviews in the New York Times, I found "Insatiable" to be tedious, boring - with a touch of "too much information."  There was nothing endearing about the chronicle and I realized I was speed reading, checking page numbers hoping I'd get to the end. A Ruth Reichel this is not 
 This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber... 
 I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist. It's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic Sherlock Holmes in the beloved Granada TV series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy. It's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman. Regardless, as usual, he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it. I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.  A young Elizabeth Hurley makes a mediocre attempt to portray a bored little rich girl with drug problems and C. Thomas Howell does his best to seem sexy in a grunge biker kind of way. But Brett's booming voice, subtle expressions and dynamic presence wakes you up for just long enough to pay attention to his character. Once he disappears from the screen, you realize all too soon that the rest of the film is worthless. It takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck, and I'm sorry to see that this was Brett's only chance to do a modern-day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away.  He briefly commented in an interview why he did the role, and soon realized the film was a disaster.  On "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" (1995)-- "I was mad to do it, but I wanted to show the world that I was still alive and I could do other things apart from Sherlock Holmes. I hope they don't release it..." 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 I had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until I bought one from our local Super Market. I was surprised at the difference that I had already paid to order from Amazon and what it was there.  I canceled my order and ordered from them.  Some items are much less on Amazon and some are much more. You just have to be careful.  A magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from. 
 Ever other knitting book/magazine/pattern etc. has stressed the importance of knitting gauge. Unfortunately, the patterns in this book don't even offer a gauge! I knit the baby booties...they came out absolutely adorable but were better suited for a Barbie than a baby...they were sooo tiny! I changed to needles two sizes larger and still ended up with bitty baby booties.  Without a knitting gauge, it is really hard to tell if you should change yarn, needles, or if you are knitting too tight or loose.   I also agree with the other readers who commented on the lack of photos. Why would I spend hours and hours on a project with no idea of what it should even look like (imagine spending two months on a sweater that you absolutely hate!).   There are sooo many other knitting books out there for beginners...skip this one and get Stitch n Bitch or Debbie Bliss "How to Knit" 
 robin trower has really lost a lot of his playing ability, same sound but no blazing licks and just a lot of trickery. two stars for the music and his new vocalist is quite good 
 The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says "modern scholars say", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority). 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I have been looking for ideas for my wedding/handfasting and thought this sounded like it might have some good ideas.  Boy, was I wrong!  The author has a very negative attitude towards anyone who wants a Pagan wedding and is not a Coven initiate, let alone a solitary.  She also makes very snide remarks about anyone who wants a Pagan wedding, but doesn't want the whole BWD (Big White Dress) format.  Overall, I would rate this book lower than 1 star if I could.  I definitely would NOT recommend it to anyone 
 Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films 
 Architecture Traveler is a waste of money . I bought it in hopes of getting guide to great new buildings in NYC . It did not have any and the guide to buildings in NYC was aweful . Buildings not listed by City but by year !!! Give me a break . 
 Over the years, I have read many excellent books on the subject of advaita - this is not one of them. Even the title is dualistic: 'I' hope 'you' die soon, that's two. And what is this future you speak of? Can you show it to me?  I have discovered that if the title is cliche and doesn't resonate - I SHOULDN'T READ IT! The title not only fails to be relative, but utterly fails, reflecting the writer's innermost feelings of despair and poison, which can be felt as one reads. After reading the three (3) testamonials on Amazon.com, I was inclined to read, yet as I proceeded, it dawned on me that the endorsements must be written by members of his own family. Because it was all redundant, drab, and regurgitated psycho-babble just like Tony's, I would say anyone would be better off dead than reading this. Just feel 'I' and spare yourself the slow torture of this masacre of the truth. If you must read a book on the subject, read Ramesh Balsekar or Ramana Maharshi, not this plagiarized brochure to authenticate Tony's enlightenment. 
 I've read many, many books in my life. Good and bad. This leans towards the bad. I gave it two stars simply for the love of the game. That is the only reason I made it through this horrid attempt at literary adaptation. I read fall of reach and found it to be a fairly decent novel. I noticed they switched writers when they published this one. This was a huge mistake. Dietz is possibly the blandest writers I have ever forced myself to read. There is absolutely no feeling to what he is writing. He even makes grievous grammar errors throughout the entire book. I found myself reading sentences time and time again in order to mine the meaning from them. Simply put, this is a bad. Real bad. I don't even think the back story is worth it. I noticed they switched back to the previous writer for the next book so someone must have noticed. If you really feel the need to read a book you've probably already played, then go for it. If you want to skip the shudders and shakes that Dietz's writing style will induce, don't feel guilty; you're not missing much. 
 the information imparted in the text is questionable, and the directives are sloppy.  it is neither a guide for housewives nor resource for professionals.  a disappointment. 
 Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference 
 This is a WONDERFUL film, but this copy of the print is NOT good, and not worth the savings.  Pay a little more if you have to to a distributer who bothered to do a good job 
 When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.  Probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the African American female. Packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.  Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  The adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer varies little in her narrative style.  Yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative.  In short, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out 
 Forced Ranking, which was forced reading from my Company's VP, was perhaps the poorest example of published material I have had the displeasure to read. My Calculus textbooks had more substance.  How Dick Grote could take 10 pages of material and repeat himself enough to make it last over 100 pages is the only amazing thing about this book 
 If you were curious how a verbalist egotripper sounds on piano, then this is the right material for you. Mr. Jarrett had his only bright solo moments at his very first piano parolas (Staircase, Facing you), some good orchestral compositions (Luminessence) and a triple of great jazz ensemble moments (not so incidentally all of them with Dewey Redman behind the sax). And that's all about him- or rather not: Lately he is teasing the ears of classical music fans with some of the most soulless interpetations one can dream about 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 Fiona Mountain had a good idea for a mystery with Bloodline, but she ruined it with her ham-fisted way of telling a story.  She seems never to have heard that the cardinal rule of good writing is "Show, don't tell", but repeatedly hits the reader over the head with the points she wants to make.  She insists on calling attention to the parallels between Natasha's life and the mystery she's investigating, as if she (the author) were afraid a reader wouldn't be clever enough to notice them on her own.  For example, in describing a scene that takes place in a garden, she says, "The exposed and tangled roots of the weeds were pale through the covering of dark soil", and then feels compelled to add, "The analogy of roots being ripped up wasn't lost on her."  Trust me, if you make it to page 262 (where this passage appears), the analogy wouldn't be lost on you either, even without the authorial intervention.      In my review of Mountain's previous book (Pale as the Dead), I commended her for not letting her research get in the way.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this book.  Too often, reading it felt like reading the author's research notes.  She even has one character -- an elderly woman who isn't an academic -- say that, in a conversation which took place many years ago, another character "quoted J. Hooper Harvey's Heritage of Britain".  I find it hard to believe that the character would have remembered not only the title of the book, but also the author's full name, right down to the "J. Hooper".  Sounds to me more like the author, fresh from the library, speaking.   The Natasha Blake mysteries are a bit like Sarah Stewart Taylor's Sweeney St. George mysteries (O' Artful Death, etc.), in that both series are about a young woman with an unusual job that causes her to get involved in solving mysteries from a different angle.   If that concept sounds intriguing to you, I would recommend that you spend some time with Sweeney St. George.  After reading Bloodline, I can't say the same for Natasha Blake.  
     I ordered this DVD to show at school to my eighth-grade class after we read the novel; however, the language was unacceptable for the classroom.  The book did not have the four-letter word nor the Lord's name in vain.  Due to the foul language, I did not show the DVD. Maybe a note that the DVD is not recommended for classroom use would be helpful. In addition, it did not follow the plot in the book.  My students were looking forward to viewing the movie and were disappointed that they were unable to do so 
 HORRIBLY loud, when I use the food processor i have to leave the room because of the high pitch screech (sp?), and it's still bad in the other room.    Does NOT work well, when i make hummus the liquid comes out the sides, when I make a smoothie it takes forever to get smooth.  I really thought it would be nice to have a 2 in 1 appliance, but this is not the one 
 One overly generous star because that's the least I'm allowed to assign this awful novel.  I read "Killing Floor" and, because it was his first novel, I excused the errors and cliches and detailed ad nauseum descriptions of bullet weights, velocities and trajectories. I gave Mr. Child a second chance and began reading his "Die Trying".  Bad decision.  Errors galore in "Die Trying".  I still have another 30 pages to read and I am trying, trying hard, to finish them.  Hate to quit a book once I begin and I've never given up this late in a novel.    Mr. Child has a favorite line that begins, "Some kind of . . .".  He fills the pages with this expression.  Super hero Reacher spots an armored vehicle moving thru Montana's mountainous forest (quite a trick, actually) and he says, "Some kind of Personnel Carrier".  Heroine Holly has a glowing character, so Child writes, "Some kind of radiant energy".  Some kind of this and some kind of that.  He uses that line on page after page.    Errors are rampant.  An M16A2 rifle, Mr. Child writes, fires three-round bursts, each round taking one fifth of a second.  So he explains that the entire three-round sequence takes one point five seconds.  Okay, he's a novelist and not a mathemetician but someone at Jove Books ought to be able to multiply one fifth of a second times three and come up with an answer somewhere below a second and a half.    Some kind of a terrible book.  
 Sally Mann hasn't a clue how to capture the souls of those she photographs!  If you are looking for artistic shots of 12 year olds then this book isn't for you.  The picture on the cover is deceiving about the books contents.  You're better off with buying the David Hamilton books (oh and by the way he is much better at photographing his subjects than Sally Mann could ever hope to be).  
 Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.  
 I was very hesitant to write this review, particularly given the fact that "In His Steps" seems universally loved.  But I felt it was important to warn others about Sheldon's lack of depth as an author.  Let me first preface my review by saying I have been reading a lot of C.S. Lewis lately.  Going from Lewis to "In His Steps" is like transferring from MIT to kindergarten.  I say this with no disrespect intended.  And while some people may find this book helpful and inspiring, I simply found it prosaic and shallow.  In my estimation, Sheldon's characters are either completely stupid or he is a shallow thinker, in either case the book holds no appeal for me.  The crux of my problem is this: the characters are one-dimensional.  We have no insight into their internal or subconscious struggles.  The weight of their decision to follow Jesus' example is undermined by the lack of attention paid to the emotional and mental conflict that accompanies any attempt to do so.  There is more struggle going on within a Christian than Sheldon remotely implies.  (Bunyan emphasizes this perfectly in "Pilgrim's Progrss" which I highly recommend.)  The transformation of the characters when they commit to their decision is also contrived.  It was as if all sin vanished in Sheldon's idyllic world when once a Christian really committed himself to following Christ.  Given St. Paul's treatment of his own struggle with sin in Romans, I find Sheldon's romanticized ideal a little hard to swallow.    The question is a good one for all Christians, what would Jesus do.  And from that standpoint, Sheldon really tries to flesh out the implications of such a question in our daily lives. Unfortunately however, in my amateur opinion, his efforts fall short of the objective and leave the reader with an uncomfortable sense that only a fraction of the story has been told.   Here's my advice.  If you like C.S. Lewis, that type of depth and psychological insight, then don't bother with "In His Steps" because you will be disappointed.  If however, you find Lewis a little confusing and amibiguous, you might enjoy the book.  In the end I think it depends upon how familiar you are with the innerworkings of the human psyche or how familiar you wish to become.  Hope this helps 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 If you wish to remain in that happy blissful world of suspended disbelief, where fairy stories continue to charm and inspire, and heroes are held sacred, then by all means never read this book.  "He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes, and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing." Gospel of John: 9: 6-7.  The intended audience of this work: the permanently cynical (me), writers, and English Literature undergraduates. For undergrads: after mentioning Foucault you quote Polti's structural plot diagnostic in some obfuscated sentence in about your third paragraph of any lit paper and you're on your way to graduating with honors. Heck, you professor won't even read any further and just slap an "A" on the darn thing. For writers: if you are stuck, reading this will send you screaming back to your alphanumeric clavichord faster than a Mustang with a tank full of white lightening and jet fuel.  One of the horrible things about reviewing is you start to think about what you've seen and read. Given man's continued Aristotelian imperative to classify, we also begin to classify written and visual literature. Soon this is distilled to an essence, and soon you read the essence instead of the story. Or the familiar story is re-written in a disguised way, and with such excellent selection of language, you don't care.  Georges Polti made things even worse than Aristotle did, and now there are no new stories under the sun. Instead of a Novel-O-Matic or "Mad-Lib: The Novel" we have Polti's "The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations." Read this and you need never read again, but will always just flip to this most essential of the "Master Plots."  Why 36? Why not. Nice factoring on that handy number, sounds plausible, and didn't Jesus die at 36 years old? Or was it 33? Aren't there "Form Critics" and deconstructionists who hold the Gospels out to be the first novels? Polti hesitates not 
 As a student reading this book for a class focusing on the French Revolution I found it too dense for someone who has no previous knowledge of the revolution.  Doyle packs A LOT of information into these 425 pages.   He does not place emphasis on any particular people or events which makes  understanding specific turning points difficult.  However, I can imagine  this book would be ideal for one who already has a thorough understanding  of the French Revolution and is simply looking for a new perspective 
 Aphoristic, not grounded in any theory, and unhelpful for my purposes. I was looking for something more than a statement or two about a topic per page. Written to showcase the illustrations, not the content. 
 I was misled,I thought I was getting a box set of thier movies and rcv'd a box set from the television series.In my excitement of recieving this I opened the package and later on learned that I could not return opened packages...So, It was a total waste for me.I did not get what I wanted at all 
 It's too bad Mr. Ridley doesn't put as much effort into examining the effects of the social environment as he does into genetics. Obviously genes have an important effect on behavior...DUH...what else is new? Mr Ridley need to enroll in graduate school and spend several yrs. researching the effects of social structure on behavior before he writes another book. He grossly over simplifies research methodologies while displaying his biased opinions based on anecdotal information. This book is not a balanced discussion of research but a vehicle for his poorly-informed views 
 I am going to build muy custom house and I want to do it according to the Feng Shui. I was expecting to find many Feng Shui floor plans samples...well let me tell you that not, it has not many Feng Shui floor plans, such a few, and most of them do not match what the book says. I mean that most of the foor plans are not according to Feng Shui bagua grid (occidental), i.e.: bathroom is Wealth area, when it is known in all schools that bathroom can't be placed there. I found just 1 floor plan, so it is not worthly to get this book if you are looking for Feng Shui floor plans. 
 First off, there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and don't like to know anything before you read it (like me) then don't read on!  What was this? I love Wendy Wasserstein as a playwright. I couldn't wait to read this book! I thought that it would be a witty satire on New York's "finest" (not the firefighters, the Upper East Siders) after 9/11. I was sorely mistaken.  The first few chapters are delightful and engaging, but soon, you long for the book to go somewhere... 307 pages later you shut the book realizing that it never did!  The political agenda being pushed was nauseating. I daresay it bordered on propaganda!   I liked not one character in this entire book- not one. At the beginning I thought that this was so that Ms Wasserstein would make a point later... SHE NEVER DID.  You can tell Wendy was an excellent playwright from the vivid descriptions of scene. It was written very visually.  I hate to say it, but this book's critical acclaim comes only from Ms Wasserstein's previous success as a playwright and her untimely death. Had she lived she would have discovered that she most certainly wasn't a novelist and should have spent her time writing what she is truly genious at- plays 
 Man what happen to Eminem. He just droped the ball on this album. Wack lyrics and weak beats is what sums this album up. I never thought Eminem was the greatest rapper(MTV veiwers say that) but he had good songs.  Eminem always has that funny or catchy single like The Real Slim Shady or Without Me, but Just Loose It was a terrible song. It looks like Eminem just didn't have anything else to write about. The Marshell Matthers LP and the Eminem Show were good albums. Not classic albums but they had some good beats and good lyrics. The Slim Shady LP had good Beats but some bad lyrics except for Guilty Conscience and Bad Meets Evil. But thats his debut album so whats Eminem's excusse for putting this trash out. Puke, My First Single, Rain Man, and Big Wennie are stupid and annoying songs. The beats in this album also are weak. I don't know how much Dre had some input but this isn't Dre's best work. Dr. Dre needs to slap eminem for putting this album out. It gives Dre a bad name and Aftermath. I only liked two songs on this album. Never Enough featuring Nate Dogg and 50 Cent was pretty good, and Encore Feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent was good but not great. Eminem do yourslelf a favor. Listen to your old albums, have Dre do all the production and you do nothing but rap. Don't have anything else to write, than let Dre write your lyrics. Sorry but this album dosn't deserve 5 stars. It dosn't even deserve 1 star but that's the lowest I can go 
  Idrove a car around three-quarters of the DR, using this book everystep of the way for nearly the entire trip. But many times the authorjust wrote a lot of nonsense. Places he describes aren't anything likethey really are, like he just asked other people to describe them andwrote what he heard from people who forgot a lot and gave him badinformation. This book is no good. 
 I often enjoy reading books written trying to read the future that are several years old. If only to see why the writer was right or wrong and where he went wrong.  Well this book was published in 1996 and is basically written around the US although other countries are mentioned in passing. The basic premises is that the new industries will employ a few people but not enough to make up the fall in the established industries. So the unemployment will go up. Furthermore we better get used to it. His partial solution is reduction in hours of employment and a greater stress on the third sector.  Looking at the US economy which most of the book is written about in the past 50 years the workforce in the US has almost tripled. Yet in the same period there is no long term trend to greater unemployment. Just look at a graph. Currently now its where it was in 1950. So obviously unemployment is not going up. So the writer got it wrong.   Looking at a graph of US unemployments percenatges, its clear that the situation was a bit high at the time of writing. The writer made a typical mistake of many futurologist of extrapolating into the far future based on the past few years.  Furthermore the writer paid too much attention to the publicity departments of R&D companies. He keeps bring us all these new technologies that are going to change the world dramatically eg getting rid of farmers with chemical vats and vanilla production from genetic research. Well, its been 10 years and most of these technologies are still coming. He obviously has forgotten Daniel Bell warning in what is an absolute gem of a book "Coming of Post-Industrial Society" that many futurologist look too hard at industries worth millions of dollars and generalize into industrials worth billions.   He seems to also forget that labour hours are dropping all the time. I am not sure what the situation is in the US but as the pay master in an Australian company, I can see that the labour hours are  steadily dropping every year. For example old timers tell me that the standard office hours 40 years ago was 44 hours a week, by the time I started working it was 40 and now at 38 hours plus now two 10 minutes breaks are included in the working hours so its more like 36 hours week. Furthermore in the past few years the number of sick days a year has gone from 5 days to 8 days a year. Two extra days a year has been introduced for compassionate leave. Long service leave (a holiday of 15 weeks) is now given at 10 years not 15 years. Furthermore the average worker now starts his employment later as he tends to study much more, so early 20s is now quite standard to start working and he retires at 55.  All this works out to a rather dramatic drop in hours worked in a generation.  Finally we come to the third sector. The sector the writer hopes is going to take some of the unemployment.  This is a sector that I have had considerable contact with over the years eg I went to a private school, been active in political and religious organizations, been computer programmer in a private cancer research organization and have been too many private hospitals. I don't see the employment opportunities. The volunteers or people on the committees that he is referring too tend to be at most a few hours a week. Hardly an equivalent of a job. Nor is it generally like they are working. Often its more socialible. The people that work for these organizations tend to be regular workers eg the janitor in the church, the nurse in a charity run hospital or teacher in a religious school does a similar job to the same people in a similar government or private institution. They tend to get paid roughly the same. Often they go from government to private to the third sector depending on who gives them a better deal. I just don't know where the writer is coming from with his arguments here. I suspect that he has little contact with these organizations.  Overall I would say that this book is best forgotten 
 ?The Storm Upon Us ? everything seems new and strange ? nothing seems certain ? masses of people are tangibly deprived of their claims to self-sufficiency ? this revolution is steadily creating the predicate for its own collapse ? the prospect of an economic or political cataclysm of unknown dimension ? .? These and similar claims are found on just the first two pages of the book. To be fair, Mr. Greider also references the ?great fortunes? thrown off by globalization and the fact that millions escape poverty, but right from the start you get the feeling that he is working backwards from his conclusions and choosing his rhetoric and his examples to sell his point of view. It?s almost as if Mr. Greider is suggesting that, now that the West has gone through the very sort of radical transformation he describes with shock and dismay, the rest of humanity should just stay where they are at while we in the industrialized world figure out if and how they should reach for the security and the lifestyle that we take for granted. If you are looking to validate an anti-globalization bias you already hold then this may be the book for you, but I think it?s fair to say that most readers would like to benefit from Mr. Greider?s considerable experience and expertise without having to interpret his selective or overly cynical presentation. In a nutshell, my problem with the book is not that it argues against globalization and is wrong, but that it is as committed to persuasion as it is to education. I chose not to finish the book and will look for a more neutral resource 
 This is the same unit that HP sells, but has Lite on do its support. Great unit for about a month. Support is not good. 
 Regrettably, I found the book's condition was too old, which I paid $37 including delivery charge. In school, I also found a used book, looking like a new book, was sold at $40. 
 The original Jungle Book was inventive, whitty, uplifting and charming.  The characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful.  The original Disney Jungle Book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child.  I can honestly say the original Disney Jungle Book movie was the only movie I loved that also touched my heart.  Jungle Book 2 is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the The original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching.  You will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of Jungle Book 2.  Don't Waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money.  It gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
 Good features include many pockets.  Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.  Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets. 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The protagonist, Holly, was one step behind the "bad guy" the whole time and never recovered.  There was no great twist in the plot line or the ending.  Many side lines ended up nowhere.  For example, the bad guy has an attraction to Holly and stalks her, but then nothing comes of it.  Holly has a big fight with an instructor and is warned that she might be in danger from him - nothing comes of it.  The dog, Daisy, is constantly mentioned throughout the book with references to her security and guard training - but Daisy never gets a chance to prove her worth - she just chases balls and does her business - no big deal.  A secret offshore bank account of Holly's is given large play in the beginning of the book - but nothing comes of it.  All the FBI's and CIA's mistakes and missed opportunities are overlooked by the big wigs - they are very forgiving - a bit hard to believe.  The story line had potential but the book has the feel of being incomplete and leaves you hanging without that "cliff hanger" thrill that would make it interesting.  As an earlier reviewer wrote - it's pretty much a big yawn. 
 The best thing about this movie was Vincent Corazza. Working with crappy dialog and a plot that tackled too many issues, he did a fantastic job expressing his character's confusing emotions without the need for words. This movie would have been really great had it stuck to the primary plot of a relationship between a married heterosexual man and a gay man. The main plot should have dealt soley with the bisexual issue and concepts of love, rather than bring in HIV, transgendered issues, fatal illnesses, dealing with the death of friends, euthanasia, etc.    Like so many 'gay' themed movies out there, it is morbid, sad, and filled with pain and suffering. Plus it deals with so many psychological issues that viewers tend to get lost and can't connect with any of the characters. Could have been much better. It's worth a look though, for Vince Corazza. 
 Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In "Preacher's Daughter" he even says "A preacher's daugher so she had common sense." I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then "Pass Me Over" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. "Sista Big Bones" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this 
 Received item in terrible packing, slight damage, missing all screws.  Hard to put together a table with no screws!  Amazon customer service was nice enough, but still no screws.  Sending back is going to cost as much as the table.  In addition, manufacturer contact information is nonexistant.  I guess you get what you pay for 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 I agree with others who have reviewed this book. There is a reason it was never published when originally written: it's just not very good. It's little more than a political and social treatise by Heinlein. If you have read all his works and want to read 100% of what he's written, you can knock this one off in a couple hours. But it will be pretty boring stuff 
 I will not repeat what others have written here about this book... but I've really got to say it. THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!  
 Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs! 
 I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career 
 James Stewart was much better in westerns and in his classic Frank Capra movies.  He just seemed worn out in this movie 
 Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection 
 There's a myth going around that Jarvis Cocker is some amazing poet, immortalising the average and championing the silent kitchenette majority.  There is an equally prevalent myth that he tapped into a musical vein that discovered something new in old synthesized sounds and cheesily orchestrated compositions.  In actual fact he both is, and has done, neither.  This record is consequently as bland as it deserves to be.   It is truly a non-event and should be avoided without giving it a second thought.  The observations Cocker is lauded for could be written by any 15 yr old public school boy who has watched Coronation Street or The Royle Family on UK TV--possibly more authentically and possibly better.  Musically it's pretty much the same deal.  You feel like asking him "what do you listen to for pleasure, Jarvis?  It certainly can't be hackneyed crap like this."  The whole thing sounds like early Scott Walker trying to do a number on a modern northern city...pretending, sub Joyce, that he casting it into an immortal and tragic frame.  The problem is that Jarvis has no muse.  There is certainly no Bloom to lift the themes and you're left with a sense of dull ideas penned on the back of  write-up from Q magazine.  I'm sure this CD will appeal to someone somewhere.  Good luck to them and bon voyage.  Perhaps I'm just too bored with mediocre efforts to lift my attention and join the party.  Jo Whiley can probably fill-in for me while I'm away doing something more interesting.     
 I was disappointed by this book.  I read the first few pages and was fascinated.  The first story in the book had some great character pathology in it, telling the tale of an obsessed man from his point of view, but the rest of the book was literally nonsensical. It was like Dr. Seuss stories without the charming rhymes or colorful pictures if they had material unfit for children.  The plots were even less well-developed than that lesser of Seuss's classics, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.  This book is a bit like that New York art gallery that I once visited that had a jar of urine on exhibit as a work of art: the bizarre is being passed off as creative.  The first story is worth reading, but the rest can be skipped in favor of the more intellectually vigorous Horton Hears a Who 
 I purchased this book as an experienced homebrewer interested in branching out (I also bought The Compleat Meadmaker, which is excellent and helpful). I was *sorely* disappointed. It has nothing of value to teach about brewing of hard ciders. It does have lots of Foxfire-type info on building a cider press, planting an orchard, choosing cultivars, etc.  But there is no real guidance for fermenting cider beverages.  If you have a farm and want to press sweet cider, this would seem to be a good book. But if you are interested in "something a little harder," look elsewhere (wish I knew where!) 
 I have read Liar's Poker, and Bombardiers, you are no Liar's Poker. Not even close. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is uneven, the scenarios are utterly and completely unrealistic. All in all, an incredibly painful read. If you haven't read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker instead; if you have already read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker again. It's that bad 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 We've got Sony's 17 inch VGN-A series notebook, and no, it doesn't fit. Once the notebook is inserted into the carrying case, it is nearly impossible to zip close. My wife uses it mostly and though the case appears durable and padded, getting the notebook inserted and the case zipped closed is difficult and very tight at best, the case needs more room to fit most 17 inch notebooks. We feared that the notebook would get damaged while trying to zip the case closed (we've owned numerous notebooks and cases over the last ten years). The Sony carrying case also does not carry much extra either. We've since bought another brand (Targus 17 inch) that fits much better and carries more items/accessories, this second one was essentially the same price. Much happier now 
 Mostly motivation talks suggesting that there are many idiots out there who will sell their houses to someone who has no credential but could talk smart 
 I had to take a look at this book just like I did Rachel Shteir's previous book "Striptease" to see if the online reviews were true. Sadly, they were. Like "Striptease", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter. Gypsy Rose, I guess we both made the same mistake: trusting someone like Ms. Shteit to help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to pull it off 
 Some interesting points made, the author is too quick to draw a strong line connecting the "moral decay" of our society in part to non-traditional families.  She focuses too strongly on the negative statistics associated with our changing family structure while under-stating the benefits (and statistics) that show how this individualism has allowed our country to prosper and which has provided women and minorities a world of opportunities which did not exist 50 years ago 
 This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone. 
 I jused used this razor for the first time and was quite dissapointed.  After many attempts, I still has stubble this razor cannot seem to get.  Luckily I work in a factory so it doesn't matter.  I'll give it another shot after I get some electric shave or something like that.  For the price and the other comments, very dissapointed.  Stick with the razor 
      WOW !        This can only be described as Dyke-lit.....Deranged Dyke-lit.       WOW !!!       Mary Daly is nothing short of a feminist version of Louis Farrakhan, only that Daly is far more extreme than that.         This is a 417 page raging screed of man hate. It's unreadable drivel. Daly dissects words, and turns them inside out to form linguistic bludgeons. A little of that can be taken as entertaining, and at least somewhat factual, or at least plausibly factual. 400+ pages of it....???  It leaves me thinking of the kook in front of my local Post Office who keeps trying to run for President. He rants complete nonsense too, he just hasn't written it down, and had it published.        As a man I find this to be not the least bit threatening. You can't even take this stuff seriously. "Gynocide" .... hun???  "Gynocide" ????  This chick has such a gyno-centric view of the world she doesn't have the faintest clue as to what makes men tick.     It's a travesty to give this thing even one star.        
 Ok, I admit I'm a dummy when it comes to wireless networking.  This book, overall was not very informative.  Many times the step by step instructions provided were difficult to follow and didn't match up well with what was shown on my PC screen.  There is a ton of "fluff" in this book, I wish they would just cut to the chase and provide clearer step-by-step instructions.  This book really did not help me much.  
 Way too easy, not worth the money 
 This is one of the worst stats text books I have ever seen.  It is very hard for someone with a logical mathematical background to understand.  Most statistical problems are addressed in text versus examples.  I would never suggest this book to anyone!! 
 I have read the previous 11 reviews on this book and they all have one thing in common; NOT ONE of them says that they have ACTUALLY repaired  or even taken a watch apart by using this book.   The first 20 pages are easy to understand, but after that too many special tools are required and I can't follow it. After reading the parts of this book that I do understand, I don't see how just ANYBODY could repair a watch by using this book. It seems to me that this book was written with the intention for it to be used as a TEXTBOOK for a watch repair tech school or for watch repairmen to refer to in their trade.    If you're looking for a book that EXPLAINS how a watch works and what makes it tick but not intended to be a repair book, well, you won't find it in this book. For half the price of this one, try 'Instant Expert: Collecting Watches'. 
 What a waste of money! Yes it will load. It has great graphics. But you can't control the games. Instructions are almost worthless. They are written as if you are using a joy stick. 
 A friend once said to me, "If you want a glossy that is a no brainer then get Vogue!"  How right she is, despite having glorious photography, fashion models that daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't be able to see them and the occasional good article in it, I have to admit I find Vogue too pretentious.  Vogue wants to be the voice of fashion, the voice of the high brow media but its clientele are the likes of you and me, ordinary people who can't afford to live the high life they are portraying on its gloss filled pages.  Personally I'd rather spend my money on a movie ticket, I get to see a good thriller, sci-fi, romance etc, etc I don't have to know about the substence abuse and emotional demons that haunt a particular actor's life, I'm just interested in enjoying myself for a couple of hours before I go back to my hard working life in the real world.  Vogue is trying to sell me a dream that I don't really want to buy into, never had a penchant for selling my soul to the devil,  it's gets two stars though because the photography is really superb, shame about the rest of it though 
 I've had two Hamilton Beach products. The first was Brew Master, which we wanted because the coffee is dispensed through a coffee carafe at the top of the machine. However, the carafe is plastic with seams and after 4 months began to leak all over the counter. Hamilton Beach replaced the carafe, but the new one leaked again after 4 months. We then demanded a Stay or Go Thermal Coffeemaker. I had it for two or three weeks and then as I was washing it out with hot water and a bottle sponge, the glass vacuum liner blew up with a bang! Glass shards scattered all over the sink and kitchen floor. I was lucky not to have gotten shards in my eyes. Please look out for this one! I'm only buying stainless steel carafes from now on 
 I used this ball with exercise video 4 times.  On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole.   
 If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published 
 This book sorely disappointed me for two reasons. I strongly agree with the thesis of the title, that the media largely abandoned their important duty as watchdogs of democracy in the run-up to the War in Iraq, HOWEVER, this issue amounts to a grand total of ONE chapter in her entire book. The rest is a bunch of anecdotes tied loosely together. In fact, it reads more like an anthology than a unified work.   The second thing that disappointed me was also something of a shock: Helen Thomas, Grand Dame, Dean of the Washington Press Corps, is a lousy writer! I am serious. I read on average one or two political/nonfiction books a month, and this is one of the most poorly written I have read yet. Some of the books I have read are by "regular" people, some by pundits, and some by politicians. Nearly all of them write in a more interesting and engaging style than Mrs. Thomas. Her tone is often conversational at best, and her stories seem to be told as much to discuss presidents' interactions with the media as to tell you what an interesting career she has had.  I could not in good faith give it one star. It isn't horrible. It is just extremely disappointing 
 Movies For The Blind is one of the top ten best hip-hop records ever made. In Stoney Lodge is perhaps one of the most empowering/gut wrenching songs about bipolar disorder ever recorded. Agent Orange, while not new for the disk, is an excellent use of A Clockwork Orange imagery. The list goes on and on. So why then did this album fall flat? On one hand Def Jux is warping him to fit there new "politically conscious" label image and turning him into an Eminem knock off (which is ridiculous because Eminem bit cage's style hard) just listen to peeranoia, and on the other Cage is not the angry twenty something he once was. Cage is now on the thirty year old patient who wants to get sober, and get his life straight. In that sense the album works, it is pretty honest at times. Yet I feel that this somewhat contradicts what happened with Movies. He makes the apology, "everything I said on Movies because of my buzz." This hurts his credibility as an artist. And a line like "this time around I'm just one of you fu8king depressed kids." who is he, Slug? I don't feel the album lived up to the impossible standards set by Movies, yet I am interested to see where he takes this new angle. Overall, it's worth a look, but nothing special 
 I have read a lot of Lora Leigh's book, and it is getting boring.  It is the same old storyline.  Alpha male leaves b/c he wants to protect the girl he loves.  Alpha male returns, and fights his attraction to the girl he loves.  I need a little more creativity and imagination in my books.  It is like she uses the same outline for everybook, just to get a book released.  Get it at the library - don't bother paying for it with your hard earn money 
 I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon. 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 Having followed Sting since the Police days, and having gotten used to his every release being a bit better, or at least more challenging, this one unfortunately really let me down.    Don't get me wrong, I'm still a very big Sting fan.  But this CD is frankly boring.  It's almost elevator music.  What's tough to understand is how Stink (sic) could have surrounded himself with such (albeit aging) talent yet still have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  Maybe it's James Taylor's fault, having added his ex-junkie wimper soft rock influence.  And golly, Sting, please don't try any more rap.  It's beneath your dignity, no matter what language it's in.  Let rappers do their c-rap, pleeeeze.  But he who never takes risks does not learn much.  Let's just all hope that this release was a great learning experience for Sting.  Let's hope that he rebounds with more CDs along the lines of Soul Cages, Ten Summoner's Tales, or even Mercury Falling 
 I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull. 
 This third volume of the Cream series disappointed me. I say this mainly because this book gets bogged down in either conceptual ideas that are less than grandiose or curatorial/theoretical high-mindedness that trumpets the intelligence and sensitivity of those compiling the list. Instead of looking at emerging artists either from the markets point of view or as those new artists inspiring other artists, this book becomes about as flat and appealing as rusty water.  Its one saving grace is that it is bringing dozens of artist's attention for the first time in a major publication. And even if these artists' work for the most part is less than overwhelming, it is interesting to explore their work. Maybe not enough time passed between the first, second, and third Creams to allow for the quality found in the first two. But I suspect it was primarily those that did the compiling this time around that are to blame for the damaging of an otherwise fine series.   Try Vitamin P or the earlier Creams if you are interested in a contemporary art survey.  
 The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie 
 I was very surprised that the editor of this book allowed it to be hyped as a book about rumspringa.  A very small percentage of the book is about this teenage Amish tradition.  The rest is about Amish life in general (farming, faith, etc.), which, while interesting, is not about the moral conflicts teenagers face.  I am a writing professor and insist that my students stick to a thesis.  As a professional writer, I often receive feedback from editors that I need to bring my writing back to the theme, instead of straying into related topics.  Therefore, again, given the title of the book, I was very surprised that so little of this book is about the teens and their temporary entry into "the world."  The author also seems to rely at times on questionable sources.  For example, at one point, he quotes an employer as saying that the decline in family farming has led to Amish teens lying more frequently.  He offers no support for this proposition other than the word of the employer, yet seems to accept it as true.  His writing is also repetitive.  He must tell us a dozen times that fewer Amish now farm.  That said, I did learn some interesting things about Amish communities 
 I really like the instructor Michelle Dozois. She teaches in the 10-minute solution series. That's mainly why I bought this dvd. I was dissapointed with it. The only routine I like is Dance Party. Other than that I think the routines are so-so. Maybe it's just me. I am more athletic and don't really like dance style to get fit. For fun, I think it's great. I don't really recommend this if you are trying to get a good cardio workout. 
 My book club read this novel. I'll admit it's well written; I couldn't have made it to the end if it had not been. However, it was impossible to relate to the crazy experiences the protagonists in this book had. I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty 
 The author writes in his Introduction "In this book the reader will find, I hope, an antidote for historical amnesia (xvi)."  To do so, Nash says that his book aims at "Disinterring these long-forgotten figures from history's cemeteries (xvii)," so the reader will encounter those figures the middle and lower ranks of American society ... [that] remain anonymous (xvii-xviii)."  But as much as it is touted as a "new" and "fresh" approach to the "untold" history of the American Revolution, I can only say that this is so much hype.    I was primed by Professor Nash's introductory claims to expect reading some new interpretation of well-known sources, or possibly some ground-breaking research into untapped primary source materials.  Instead, I quickly realized that while many of the narratives on eighteenth century America were interesting, there was little that was "new" or "innovative," except his assessment that his interpretation was somehow "radical."  In fact, I soon realized that I was familiar with most, if not all, of the people and events he described: so much for being "new."  A look at Nash's source citations will show he has actually done little or no actual "research."  Instead, he has produced an analysis of old narrative histories, many of which have been around for decades, as well as some more recently published secondary accounts.  Quotations, more often than not, are attributed to other historians, or if historical figures, are "quoted in" other secondary sources.  This is how good undergraduate research papers are constructed, but as a published work, it must be described as "analysis," and not a "contribution to the body of historical knowledge."  Furthermore, many of the older sources he quotes would otherwise be those of the sort he would criticize.    It reads as if it is written more for other academic historians, rather than to educate a reading public starving for historical narrative.  Nash injects "political correctness" into his analysis at the expense of really understanding the era.  For example, he never describe the Six Nations of Iroquois as an "Empire," as if only Europeans can be guilty of creating such polities; although they ceded Shawnee or Mingo land claimed by right of conquest to white settlers.  In another example, he implies that the captivity of white children and their adoption into Indian societies was somewhat kindly.  The murders of the rest of the captives' family or the sense of loss experienced by those surviving the raids are thus minimized.  That some of those who refused repatriation may have suffered from an eighteenth century version of "Stockholm Syndrome" is not explored; while those who escaped or accepted repatriation and related not so pleasant experiences in their captivity narratives are ignored or marginalized.  In Chapter 5, "The Dual Revolution," Nash indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding about the military history of the American War for Independence in general, and the war on the frontier in particular.  One clue is given in his description of the Wyoming Massacre of 1778, the "grisly story of Tory and Indian brutality," of which he concludes "Modern scholarship supports none of this (255)."  Yet, even the Tory commander Major John Butler's report, available in the Sir Frederick Haldimand Papers in the Canadian Archives and British Museum, recorded that the Tory rangers and their Indian allies "took 227 scalps and only five prisoners."     Overall, Nash's account just plainly gets a lot of it wrong!   
 If done horribly wrong.  Cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong Anime feel to it.  Sadly the movie is complete and total garbage.  The story here is that Jean Claude Van Damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the Anarchist future.  There also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing Mankind, and a Cyborg knows the cure.  That part of the story is irrelivant.  For the most part it is Van Damm traveling across the US attempting to catch up to this Madman and stop him.  Somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion.  OVerall this movie is a waste and you can tell Orion Entertainment was Milking Van Damm for all he was worth at this time.  Avoid 
 The hyperbole won't seem appropriate to most people, but for me this was the single most un-enjoyable movie I've ever seen, ever. Every aspect of it was painful.   First, the production values: this movie is just ugly. I guess the biological computers are supposed to be a novel or deep concept, but it's just disgusting and really very poor looking. At times I thought they just rooted through the medical examiner's dumpster to gather props. I understand that you can't really have nice props in a low-budget movie, but with the setting and technology so central to the plot you think they could've paid for a decent production designer. Everyone says this is not a "special effects" movie and that the ideas behind it are what counts, but plenty of low budget movies didn't look this bad and were able to convey something new.  The acting: just one thing in a sea of annoyances here was Jude Law's accent. It's terrible, and he lets his native one slip several times. It's distracting and sloppy. The dialogue was just bad overall, so I blame the writer for most of this.  This movie is not "misunderstood." It's an objectively bad movie. It's unentertaining, boring, and scrabbling for a significance that only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors will care about and dogmatize. A lot of reviews said it was better to see it as a black comedy, but this movie is only unintentionally funny, if at all. I'd give it zero stars if I could, as I'm trying to warn people away from this turd 
 I chose this book because I have long been interested in the Salem Witch Trials. I really enjoyed the parts of the story which dealt with Kim's search for the truth of her ancestor' role in the tragedy. I'll admit that I mostly skimmed the parts which dealt with Kim & Edward's relationship---as characters, they are totally unbelievable and not very likeable.  The part I found most surprising was Kim's attitude towards medications, especially considering that she is a nurse. The drug research storyline was so, eh, I don't even have a word for it. Not worth reading. The interactions between the characters in the book are stilted and painful. I think we are supposed to feel sympathy for Kim's social awkwardness & anxiety, but really you just want to shake her and tell her to grow a backbone already. As much as I love reading, I can not  recommend this book to anyone. 
 This is, as one can guess by the title, an academic book. Obviously it is; it is difficult to say, even after reading it, what exactly it means. Does it refer to "cultures" created by U.S. Imperialism? Or perhaps to  "cultures" created within the U.S. by imperialism? The  predictable answer would be "both," an answer that seems to be  given by the structure of the book itself, which not only includes essays  on the impact of U.S. imperialism on other nations but also essays on the  impact of imperialism "on-shore," so to speak. One such essay is  by a professor named Bill Brown, who writes on, apparently, the  relationship between the Panama Canal and artificial limbs in "The  Prosthetics of Empire." This, to a non-academic, might sound  surprising, but it is if anything rather banal these days. But what is  really interesting about Brown's essay is that, while he seems to be  well-within the crypto-Marxian, post-everything critical theory mish-mash  of what passes for academic thought these days, he has actually, in a  somewhat weird way, entirely transcended those boundaries. How, you might  ask? Well, the answer seems to be that Brown has taken the bold step of not  merely just making assertions, as critical theory types are wont to do, but  he has even dispensed with that old-fashioned technique of the bourgeois  class, and written an essay that does not just merely gesticulate at  argumentation but has left argumentation behind entirely. What I mean is,  Brown doesn't just say that there is a connection between artificial limbs  and the Panama Canal and be done with it; instead he just proceeds as if  there was a connection. This, you might say, is a stunning achievement, and  one has to praise not just Brown, but also his editors for their courage in  publishing it. Of course, not all of the essays in this volume are this  "edgy," but don't be surprised next year when you find used  bookstores awash with it. By then, of course, the work of Brown and his  compatriots will have been denounced as just another victims of cooptation  by the "hegemonic state.&quot 
 The only reason I completed this silly, disappointing novel was because I had just finished all of Welty's remarkable short stories and her flawless novella, "The Optimist's Daughter."  It's as if a completely different author had written this superficial, fatuous novel.  If you desire to read about 20 forgettable people in a seriously inbred family speaking at the same time about the impending wedding of one of their own, then this novel is for you.   The only explanation for this work is that it came very early in Welty's career.  I realize that others have defended this novel as revealing quintessential Southern dialogue and acute psychological tension in the characters.  While the dialogue is clearly of the South, it is senseless, repetitive and tedious, and the characters dash madly in and out of the novel, without making any lasting impression on this reader. Instead, read Welty's short stories and "The Optimist's Daughter" and you will discover a totally different Welty:  one whose fully realized characters and profound psychological insights will leave you with the enduring belief in her genius.     
 I looked forward to readng this book only to be disappointed right away (in the preface) where Mr. Lee states while ennumerating the victims of WW2 that Joe Stalin killed 12 MILLION of his own people during the war. Where do people come up with this stuff?!? Bullhockey like this made me suspect the rest of the book which is basically old wine in a new bottle. Mr. Lee is kind of a re-revisionist who seeks to give ALL the credit for winning WW2 to those wonderful Anglo-Saxon Allies and their wonderful intelligence services. Alot of this may be true theoretically but in real life wars are won by fighting and killing and the Soviets did the lion's share of German killing in WW2. As far as the US war against the Japanese being racsist- it certainly isn't news that US planners thought an invasion of Japan would be incredibly costly (approaching a Soviet-style sacrifice). I personally think if dropping the bomb saved one US soldier's life then it was worth it but I don't think its necessary to use statistical gerrymandering and dubious psycho-history to prove it. This book belongs to a new type of "history" where WW2 is being made to seem mostly a Western victory, when it was in fact largely a Soviet victory too 
 This flick has all the sophistication of a music video. It is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time, while Yugoslav rock music blares. The relationship between the Serb and Muslim boyhood-friends-turned-enemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored.   It is no different than every other movie on the Bosnian war, with the exception of No Man's Land. It does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds. Obviously there were "ordinary" Croatians, Serbians, and some Bosniacs involved in atrocities, but this is only part of the story.  I got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early 1990s in Germany. 
 A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts 
 Grant's Dissector leaves much to be desired.  The dissection instructions are not all that clear nor are the drawings that great.  It seems to skip around a lot with the dissection.  It also mentions a lot of structures to look for which aren't in the drawings.  I would recommend the authors reconsider their layout.  I would also consider looking at other dissectors if you are looking to buy one 
 The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about 
 This book is quite dated.  It was published in 1999, and unless you want to focus on movies from 1931 to 1998, this is a poor choice.    There is no good reason why this book has not be updated, such as "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" which has been revised, adding 17 newer movies, and deleting 17 of the prior 1001 movies.  (I wouldn't have minded them simply adding the 17 movies, without deleting any older movies.)   Another good choice is Peter Travers' new "1000 Best Movies on DVD."  
 Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.  As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 If you are a fan of Ashlee Simpson or Kelly Osbourne, I think you'll really like this album. This seems to be the template for their careers. If you are into anything rougher/cruder in sound than those ladies, I'd say stay away from this. It will only disappoint 
 When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc 
 I puchased the USA Mapsend TOPO 3D (98061109) to use on my laptop. My goal was to download route/track and waypoint data from my Explorist XL GPS to store and view on my computer. There was trouble from the start. My GPS only has a USB cable, while the software will only read from a COM port. Once I got the data into the computer, I had to translate it so the software would recognize the format (these were supposed to work together!). The detail for tracking through the woods was totally unacceptable. Also, I have to always have disk 3 installed before I can even run the program. There was supposed to be an option to not require the disk during installation. I guess the program ignored this... The Explorist works great! If possible, I would return this software and recommend to anyone NOT to use it!! 
 Due to Sharon Olds' ambiguous subjects, it is difficult to know if she is talking about a child or a lover. I was assigned this book in college, and my classmates and I jokingly referred to it as "kiddie porn." Half of the class thought she was sensually admiring her lover's genitals, while the other half insisted she was lovingly watching her children grow. I am not sure if she intentionally created a vague subject, but I felt dirty after reading this book 
 These sages' examples of bravery and devotion are inspiring.  Their words, deeds, and teachings stand alone like all great masters. I feel blessed to have seen, read and spoken their sacred words.  For that I am greatful, however, what these sages do not need is a rude and angry woman standing on their shoulders with an axe to grind 
 It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..."  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean 
 i wish i had seen that guy from swedens review before i bought that book.. i must agree with him.. from the first page i was reading incorrect information.. i will be returning this book for sure. i was all excited to get the book and when i saw incorrect information in first page, i went to the part about dahmer (about whom i have read a lot of books) and the info there was not consistant w/other books on him. i would like to know where they got some of their information for this book. it reminds me of another bad book 'cannibal killers' by moira martingale. if you want to read a really decent, accurate book... read a book by john douglas or robert ressler!! 
 Oh. My. God. If you've ever wanted to read a book written by someone who is ungrateful and whines and thinks they are better than everyone else, this is YOUR BOOK!!!  This book is so long and drawn out and has NO POINT.  The author had absolutely no reason to write this book, other than to vent their ungratefulness on the rest of us. It breaks down like this: Polish family flees to Canada to escape the Nazis. They start out rough but end up doing quite well. WHERE'S THE STORY!?  The "author" goes on and on and on about how boring things are and describes her self-superiority over everyone else with paragraph after paragraph of just boring descriptions.  It's no fun to read.  She had it VERY WELL growing up in Canada - her family was safe and ended up making a good living there - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!?  The author has an attitude problem - rather than try to make do in her new envrironment, she just whines and whines about it CONSTANTLY. At least her little sister tries to blend in. This one just cries about it and seems to think she can see more or understand more than everyone else around her.  News flash: YA CAN'T.  You are just like everyone else honey.  You should be grateful for all your parents did for you instead of fighting it every step of the way. Don't read this book. It's boring 
   Greene is a conman, you dopes! You're being set up to buy this watered down Machiavellian compost, using the 50% of his "laws" that don't contradict the other 50%.   He gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified, desirable, and trustworthy. You're all going to die, sorry. Try to imagine what they'll be saying at your funeral, no matter how rich and powerful you (in your dreams) become by using the self-contradicting nonsense in this book. "Man, what a selfish prick" would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment.  
 Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study. But as the previous reviewer has observed, however, all of the tales in this collection are instantly forgetable as they are trite in conception and poorly written. They have the collective depth of creative writing exercises in a first year class. I threw my copy away 
 The display - instead of being simply clear plastic over the LCD it's got a surface treatment (to prevent glare?) that becomes steadily more difficult to read through in a period of 3-4 months.  The case - battery cover comes off at odd moments, the magnet popped off the back  The UI - only fair  I've had 3 Polder timers - the first lasted until an accident took it out of commision (several years). Since then, I've had two different models and they've both worked poorly and failed very quickly.  This product is a stellar example of what's wrong with many consumer goods today. Instead of making a product that we can pay a fair price for and use for 5-10 years (or more), we get sold junk that fills up landfills 
 I had to do alot of improvising for alot of the receipes in this book. Good thing I know already how to cook soul food. I wouldn't recommend this book for a first time soul food cook. 
 Bought for my wife and it is usless. Short battery life and poor suction. A total waste of money 
 On paper, a lot is wrong with Layzie Bone's August 22 release "The New Revolution". The album has a poorly planned release date, virtually no promotion, odd guest appearances, and an unlikely record label. As Bone Thugs-N-Harmony prepares for a full-blown comeback with a group album set for a September 19 release and another coming in the following year, Layzie appears to have sneaked in a solo album at the worst possible time. But after giving the album a few listens, this date almost makes sense. While always regarded as a talented and entertaining rapper, Layzie's solo releases have always been spotty and plagued with cluttering filler tracks. 2001's "Thug By Nature" provided everything the title would suggest and nothing more, and 2005's messy "It's Not A Game" was barely tolerable, mostly unreleased tracks spanning his whole career thrown together on a single disc. His collaboration album with Young Noble was definitely a step in the right direction, but this new release does not continue in that manner. If "The New Revolution" could be described in one word, it's awkward. His head-scratching decision to sign with Hi-Power Records doesn't seem to pay off, with guest appearances from numerous obscure chicano rappers that don't mesh well with Layzie's style. Much of these collaborations are spent with various Mr. Criminals and Mr. Capone-Es shouting "West coast! South Central!" type of cries and Layzie trying to draw a connection to Cleveland. Speaking of awkward, the only Bone member, or should I say former Bone member, to show up is Bizzy, for the forced collaboration "Streets". What's left of the formerly strong Mo Thugs collective also shows up for the uninspired "Touchdown".  Layzie's inconsistent lyricism on his solo albums has always been part of what lent to his troubles in the field before, and "The New Revolution" is no exception. Many tracks contain the classic Bone cries of "Mo murda", "Thuggin' for Cleveland", "Smoke some weed", which even by now are starting to grow tiresome, which would not be the case if the whole album weren't full of them. The Bone cliches plague the album, but Lay mostly fails to bring any originality to them; a Bone fan will feel like they've heard most of these verses before. Production ranges from decent to sounds-like-it-was-made-on-my-cousin's-laptop, but none would be referred to as great, often just minimal beats and instrumentals. For the most part, Lay just fails to deliver the thug tails, the slower melodic tracks, or the triple-time verses that usually work so well for him.  The first full song is "Vote For Me", which is certainly a highlight for the album but doesn't even fill its potential. It has nice slow production, and Layzie drops a couple relevant and conscious verses, exploring the world's problems and calling for unity as Bone did on tracks like "Change the World" and "Home" in the past. However, at the end when Lay declares, "I should be your president...vote for me!" it left me scratching my head. It made his message for the whole song unclear and just makes it sound confused. "Mo Murder" bears the same name as the classic Bone song off the "E. 1999 Eternal" album, but no one would ever confuse the two. It's a forced collaboration with Big Sloan, with generic production and uninspired verses and chorus containing the same cliches that we've heard from Bone spinoffs for ten years. The words and production of "For My Weed Heads" and "I Get Higher" are barely distinguishable, both fine tracks but the two together are redundant. They both are about Layzie's sheer love of the ganja, why we should all have a puff, et cetera. They both have a Latin guitar backing and a sung chorus, and they're both weed songs for the Bone Thugs vaults. "Midwest-Westcoast Connection" is the most awkward collaboration, this with Hi-Power rapper Mr. Criminal. The production is decent upbeat woozy g-funk, but the collabo is as awkward as the title would suggest. This is followed by "From the 99", which might sound like just another Cleveland reppin' thug tune, which basically it is. However, we haven't had any of these songs for a few years from any Bone member, so it's an enjoyable track. Lay remembers the other thugs lost on "For the Thugs That's Gone", which works pretty well. "Wanted to Be a Soldier" really cramps Layzie's style for his Hi-Power collaborators, as does a later track, "These Hi-Power Soldiers", neither of which sound have ended up on a Layzie Bone album. Both are awkward, forced, and irrelevant to anything. "Say Lady" with Mr. Criminal turns out to be one of the best tracks on the disc, well produced and entertaining. "Streets", with the Bizzy Bone appearance, does pretty well for what it's intended for but again sounds uncomfortable. The odd outro starts with a Bizzy Bone verse and then just kind of fades into a weird advertisement.  "The New Revolution" doesn't really contain any bad tracks, but has no great ones either. At the end, I find that it's a pretty uninspired release, even if it isn't terrible. Layzie is a truly talented artist and can definitely do better than this; I feel like I have heard a lot of this album before. This isn't one I will be listening to much repeatedly. Bone fans such as myself may enjoy this because of the lack of recent music from the camp, but with so much scheduled for the near future, this one should be quickly forgotten, and that might just be okay 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 I am a mother of a three year old boy with the spectrum disorder of autism. I could not wait to read this book because of the "miracle" title. Halfway through, I realized the mother was the one with major issues. Ms. Steils position was a difficult one having one daughter with leukemia and the other with autism. I was extremely dissapointed to see how long it took her to bond with Georgie. She was institutionalised and labled and slipped through the loops so to say as her mom fought for her sanity. In this broken and torn apart family it's a wonder to even say Georgie could have been saved sooner if more time and effort were given to her. Very sad and depressing tale of a mother who never had a clue as to what her daughter needed the most --her 
 Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevara by Ernesto Guevara  Warning this book seems intended to make martyrs  Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.          
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 the 6o's Blue note records are some of the greatest recordings, especillay the reissues of Rudy Van Gelder series. Any book has a lot of potential on this topic but the author is clueless-no research, no "where are they now", no inside information. Don't waste your time or money-I've seen liner notes with more insight than this.Buy the music instead 
 Wendy doniger has recently received a lot of flak for her so called "research". For the past 2 decades she virtually ruled the field of indology unchallenged. With the emergence of a new set of Indian scholars who have disputed the various premises of her work, Doniger has been caught o the back foot. An obessive desire to interpret virtually every fable or fact of hinduism using freud's psyco-analytical theories brings to light truely ridiculous conclusions. It is a well known fact that the Manu-smriti is not the final say of indian laws and opinions. People who do not know the difference between strutis and smritis should not have the arrogance to project hinduism in less than factual ways. For authoritative studies on indology read books by carl jung and Rajiv Malhotra. Doniger's books will only satisfy your appetite for tabloidy scandalous reports on hinduism 
 Yeah, so Blanchett's character plants a bomb to kill a drug dealer. Where would an English teacher get a bomb in Italy, in a Boms-R-Us store? And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie 
 I disagree with the author.  First, Propecia grows hair in one area at the expense of another.  Spironolactone has been proven to stop the growth of hair.  DHT does not cause hair loss.  Spencer does not even mention the nutrient theory of baldness and how many people have been regrowing scalp hair by removing body hair, allowing nutrients to get to the scalp. Can you tell me what it takes to grow scalp hair if not androgens? Erni 
 If "false memories" of childhood sexual abuse are truly false, then why aren't people having false memories en masse about other traumatic events in their lives, such as being beaten up, or having car accidents? This book obviously serves to perpetuate the taboo our culture has around the subject of childhood sexual abuse. This book is nothing but a business card Loftis uses to hand out to defense attorneys with budgets large enough to pay for her testimony.   If you want to know how trauma affects memory, try reading Traumatic Experience and the Brain by Dave Zeigler, Ph.D. 
 I can't believe the laudatory reviews this novel as received. Extremely long-winded with no discernible plot, direction or characterization. This is one of those novels that doesn't make any sense at all but receives positive reviews because people think "well, I didn't understand it, so it must be good." Sorry, I don't give any writer that much credit. Don't waste your time or money on this one 
  For me, my low rating of this film might be, at least in part, the result of having wrong expectations about it.   I had heard this film described as 'charming' and 'funny,' and was expected a comedy, albeit a somewhat black one. But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth.   It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story. 
 If you already own Jack Hunter's book "Inside Teradome" then you won't need to buy "Freak Babylon". The publishers simply enlarged the print and the photos in the teratology section of "Inside Teradome", called it a new book and gave it a new name. Kind of deceptive, I think. But perhaps, with this review, I can save someone else from throwing their money away like I did 
 This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though 
 Bass' book is stuffed to the gills with details about battles and personalities surrounding the campaigns of Francis Marion, but, as a newcomer to the subject, I found that to be more problematic than helpful.  If one does not already possess a working knowledge of the subject, the amount of detail and Bass' constant jumping from event to event is somewhat overwhelming.  I also found that the lack of a consistent narrative gave the book a text-book quality. 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 I eagerly looked forward to buying and reading this book.  Having read Jensen's other books, I have come to appreciate his willingness to address the ills of this society.  However, I was deceived by the title, which I felt would discuss revolution or solutions to the ills of this society.  Here is the final line to the book, "There is much work to be done.  What are you waiting for?  It's time to begin".  To be honest, I expected more.  I could not shake the feeling that Jensen's recollection of the class discussions were half made up.  If you are seeking a book that looks at how a teacher can institute a no grading policy in class while seeking to institute a non-hierarchal classroom, then this book MAY be for you.  I say MAY, because being a teacher myself I have already played with these ideas and more.  I liked at times how Jensen addresses the free-loader problem within the system he uses, and although he fixes this problem within his classes, he never discusses the ramifications of his solutions or the ramifications of letting a free-loader turn in more than one or two recycled papers throughout the semester.  Hence, the disappointment of the book.  I honestly found myself saying three-quarters of the way through the book, "What a waste" and "This feels like filler".  To sum up, Jensen's previous books are wonderful because I knew what I was getting, this book I felt did not address the issue of change (revolution) and thus I was not satisfied.  Be free thinkers and then what?  Bring back the Renaissance era?  What happened to the Hippies in the 60's?  They got jobs.  How do we negotiate idealism and realism?  The solution must address both 
 I have never read this author before and probably won't again. I found the story hard to follow from the beginning and if you are an animal lover you probably will be as repulsed as I was in the sequence about "skinning the cat down to his whiskers and watching him stagger around."  This book is going in the trash literally and I didn't care to read any further than the cat episode which was quite early on 
 Somewhat useful book in that it pulls together the info that is readily available on the internet, particularly from state government websites 
 I bought these CDs for a friend of mine with Multiple Sclerosis.  She is very spiritually connected and conveys this message just by existing in her tiny room...She was looking forward to hearing this CD and when we chose the time, she became more and more horrified with what this woman was saying.  She is flip, arrogant and contradicts herself several times.  It was actually a pretty scary experience.  It's as though she has been so jaded by life, there is no emotion or compassion left in her.  I would suggest other authors or avenues if you are looking into your spirituality 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language 
 Heinlein was a brilliant writer in many ways.  However his knack for writing believable characters within the philosophical and moral framework of his stories is what really makes him a favorite of so many people.  The live-action movie saw Starship Troopers as an excuse for explosions, CGI, and gun porn, completely ignoring everything that made the book worthwhile.  This series attempts to correct that, returning the focus to the characters and how the war shapes them as individuals.  Unfortunately it fails.  The voice acting is wooden, reminiscent of the lowest of the low-budget Hanna Barbara cartoons.  The noncoms and officers sound and act like caricatures of caricatures; the Intel man in Operation Bug Drop lacked only a big black moustache to complete the image of a cheesy cartoon super villain.  E. G. Daly's over-the-top style is perfect for her role in the tongue-in-cheek Powerpuff Girls series; here it just seems lazy.  Regarding character development, Juan and Dizzy get fleshed out a bit, but the effort is half-hearted, without the skill or poignancy of Heinlein's original effort.  I simply could not bring myself to believe in or care about the characters.  As often as this show gets compared to the WWII epic serial Band of Brothers, I feel the need to point out one major difference: in real life, main characters die.  In war, real people get shot in the neck, lose arms, get their faces burned off.  Yet nobody dies (or even stubs his toe) in the animated Starship Troopers.  The characters are invincible, and as a result I was never emotionally drawn into the story.  I never believed that the characters faced real danger, and apparently the voice actors didn't believe it either.  Some reviews trumpet this lack of violence-on-humans as a positive; such a claim entirely misses the point of the story, and would likely draw harsh words from Heinlein himself.  Viewers who have problems with cartoon violence would probably find The Smurfs much more enjoyable 
 We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture 
 Well, it appears I'm one of the only ones to dislike this book, and it's by my favorite author, too!  The only good part about it was that it starred my two favorite people *ahem* characters, Tony Hill and Carol Jordon. There is no real mystery, as the killer is revealed immediately. Despite the opinions' of others I didn't find the book particularly scary, either.   The best part of this novel was when it was over, so that I could start The Last Temptation, the third, and, in my opinion, most amazing, Tony Hill/Carol Jordon novel 
 i'm sorry but this is one of the weakest biographies i have ever read (and yes, i have read more than one). the writing is very poor, it reminds me of a grade 8 essay where you can easily see the way the facts have been jotted down in point form and then strung together to form sentences and paragraphs. i feel like half the time the author was simplky reciting a stat or tidbit jotted down on a cocktail napkin.  hendrix never comes alive in this book, you never get a feel for who the man was or where his genius came from and took him. it all feels very quick and breezy, little commentary or insight and more just a retelling of facts long since comitted to the annals of rock legend.  i daresay that the author would have done well to read the few cover stories on jimi put out over the years by britain's mojo magazine. these manage, in their few short pages, to tell the same story in a far deeper and more meaningful way.  when one compares this with - for example - neil young's biography 'shakey' by jimmy mcdonough, one can immediately see the difference between a well written biog and a poorly written one. icons are always a tough creature to dissect, there are layers and layers of worship and legend to get through to get to the real facts and paint a glimpse of the real person. but this also involves good writing; a biographer cannot simply write as a journalist, reciting facts and taking a time-out from any sort of personal insight or commentary. ultimately a good biographer seeks to explore the individual, to journey through their life and vividly assemble and comment on the facts, events, rumours, heresay, and legends that create that persona.  that is rarely done in this biog. this is a safe, conservative, backseat look at an artist who was rarely anything other than a complex genius who truly needs to be looked at with a critical as well as factual eye to fully understand.  not so the case here. skiiiiiiiiip it.   
 This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester 
 Musically this is probably an ok CD - I say probably because as others have said it is so hard to listen to this CD it is going to gather a lot of dust. A waste of money and one I shall not repeat.  
 The content of the book is good and my 2-year-old son enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately the paper is of low strength and is not up to the hard use that young users can dish out 
 This refers to the audio version only:  The wife has read the entire series one after the other and really enjoyed them.  Since I'm in the car for my job I listen to a lot of audio tapes.  I liked the story well enough, but the reader is terrible.  For some reason he thinks Banks' voice is deeper than whale dodo.  He strains to get the deepest possible register and frankly I found it very annoying.  I mean no one talks like that.  It may be that the reader has no confidence using his voice for femine characters, so he uses his regular voice for the female characters, then feels he has to go super low for the masculine.  I managed to get through the whole book but just barely. I tried another of the Bank's series, but got so irritated at the unbelieveable voice I had to give it up.  If I ever get the time I'll have to read the series as I sort of enjoyed the story 
 ...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.  Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that 
 I don't understand how this can be called a soap saver.  It is completely useless and I have disposes of it. I do not understand why you will not print my review.  I am a very good Amazon customer 
 i can't rate it because i received (2)discs from amazon and bth of them jammed on me i would luv to see this movie .Beware if your considering ordering it. 
 I like this author, the Hot Zone was a marvelous book and the fiction version was not that bad.  These were the only two reasons I picked up this book.   The description of the book sounded somewhat interesting, but without the author I would have passed on it.   In hindsight that was a mistake.  The author really did try his best to make a business case study more aptly used in a college class then a mass publication book, interesting to read.  He could not pull it off.   The good flow of the book and the fact that it at least tries to keep you interested is due to the skill of author.   Yes there is a lot of detail about this new form of making sheets of steel, but unless you are in the industry or a gluten for punishment I would stay away from the book 
 It is a far stretch to call this a "documentary".  A comedy would be more appropriate.  I think there was more scientific fact in "the day after tomorrow 
 This book is dangerous.  It does not present an overall method (or even practical starting points) for treating people with depression. Throughout the passages the author seems to be speaking to himself and his dead sons as much as to the reader.  It gives readers 30 anecdotal and ideological glimpses into the disorder and it's treatment. This probably does more harm than good in the long run.   I think many readers are likely to start practicing arm-chair psychiatry . . . "it is reasonable to confront them [patients] with the selfishness and anger implied in any act of self-destruction . . ." What a dangerous (angry? guilty?) generalization!  Dealing with depression takes a "patient-centered" approach. Confrontation MAY have it's place, but later in THERAPY. And even then being dependent on multiple factors (patient-doctor relationship, in-patient vs. out-patient, support networks, patient himself).   Someone suffering from depression may get useful insights out of this book. It should NOT be read by family or friends looking for help dealing with a depressed person. 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same. This is a four dollar movie in any department store 
 The 2 stars are strictly for the London portion of Rosie's life - which has much of Fielding's talent for humor in romance.  But as soon as Rosie's story gets serious, it fails.  Granted, as other reviewers pointed out, most of us reading this were attracted by the fact that Helen Fielding is the author.  But she had a way to go before she honed the skills that made Bridet Jones so enjoyable to read.  
 My best advice for anyone even thinking about buying this book is .... click on and delete the wasteful and useless business concepts this book presents. Hunter and crowd are out of date and way out of touch with sound business reality 
 This product works well for me (I have a very small one-level house) but getting the HEPA filters that go with it is harder than finding that needle in the haystack. You used to be able to get them at most retail stores--now, Euro-Pro won't even supply them to the vacuum specialty companies.  I've made tons of calls and all they've done is echo my complaints.  The ONLY way I was able to find them, besides on this site, was through Euro-Pro itself.  They try to get you to sign up for their "filters for life" program first on their site, which is a ripoff.  If you just order their filters, they don't give you an 800 number to call--I found one in an old filter box--they want you to do it all over the web.  Why?  Because they're in India, at least the "customer service" people are.  While waiting on my filters to arrive, I borrowed another model Shark vacuum from someone, and I couldn't even get to the air filter to clean it--the instructions say it should just pop out--ha, ha.  Clearly, Euro-Pro doesn't want you to keep their products for a long time, which is why they stop making the parts easy to get after a few years.  I have only had my vacuum for three years, not thirty.  It should be easier to get filters than this.  Much, much, much easier. I spent a minimum of eight hours trying to get these filters over a few weeks. Next time, I'm buying a Bissell 
 Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time 
 I was extremely offended by the author's disrespect towards his subject, not to mention bored to tears by his dusty writing-style. This book was written eighty years ago by a man who consistently belittles the spiritual beliefs of all non-christian peoples, and refers to the buddhist, taohist, and hindu cultures as being childish, pathetic, silly and to be pitied and ridiculed on many levels. His attitude towards dragons is nothing if not derisive. Do not be taken in by the book-jacket review and the playful cover. If you want a book tracking the rise of dragon worship throughout the world, but with little to no historical folklore, than this is your book. But if you are looking forward to reading entertaining dragon lore from around the globe, than this is NOT what you are looking for 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 Too much time invested in a story far too long with little to say in a convoluted but simplistic plot. It was a labor to finish and very unsatisfying. Very little substance to Mr. Dahlquist's story. Skip it!  S. Russel 
 scary book, weird things will come out of your closet if you read this book.  It is so dull it made me scream. The main caracter ronofer is an anorexic boy who likes to tell u all his problems. His brother beats him up and he only has 2 friends who happen to both be speacial. 1 cant talk. If you want a depresing book u got it.it will make your hart crush. tears 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 As has been pointed out, these are new recordings of old songs. and has been pointed out, none of these versions is significantly different than the originals, and none of these performances surpasses the originals. It's not a bad album, but for those of us who listened to this band when it was new, there's nothing added here. If you are new to GOF, buy History of the 20th century or Entertainment. This was a great band worth checking out, but I can't say that about this recording. 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. * 
 I ordered this book to learn about the white crane system and to learn a bit about chi gong. The book has about 200 pages where the same information that can be written in 50 pages is regurgitated and only then do you get some white crane information. The pictures and sequence where hard to understand since several movements are depicted in one still and a few lines are supposed to let me know whet just happened. There is a pit of good information here but the bitter fruit that surrounds it is hard on the digestion 
 We expose our babies/toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources, in several languages.  Therefore, having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one, given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment (our little ones are trilingual: English, Spanish and ASL, and they ignore us in all them!).  Big mistake.  The video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other Baby Einstein (BE) items.  In earlier BE products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen.  Male hands were never present.  This video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background, or at best, an elderly man briefly interacting with a child.  Everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing, caring or otherwise being nurturing to children.  Males are only seen (with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes, or at least distant, dry and quiet poses, such as talking with a much older (male) child.  It is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape, however as movable and inane as potted plants, whom you can move and place at will.  I felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities.  Asides, when you go into the Spanish version, it is (for a professionally produced video) riddled with mistakes.  Three objects are mislabeled.  In the first, when a cup - the plastic or paper tall type , not the coffee and saucer version, it is called "la taza", when in reality it should be "el vaso", as unlike English, where it is interchangeable "vaso" is  the specific word for that item.  The second - much worse instance, still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl.  There, the clueless scripter translated it as "el bol", a clear and poor corruption of the English word into a one commonly used in Spanglish, instead of calling it "tazo'n", as its correct name is.  The last one I saw was in the yard (I'm suprised they didn't call it la yarda!: "Looka mami! get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas!").  This time they called an obvious swing (two ropes and a seat in between) "la hamaca", when in reality hamaca means hammock.  Fortunately, we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls, but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages.    In sum I was discusted with the whole thing.            
 Whitney Houston is a nice-looking woman, has a beautiful voice, a good selection of songs... Why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her "Greatest" Hits???...  The first disc is OK, almost all of her best romantic hits ("Didn't We Almost Have It All" and "Saving All My Love For You" plus the main theme for "The Bodyguard" originally from Dolly Parton) are included. The second disc however, is purely another attempt to promote these modern (and weird) DJs that "mix" dancing themes, whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions!  
 It's sad to say, but this biography of Johnny Unitas, arguably the greatest quarterback ever to lace up cleats, is woefully unimpressive.  Lou Sahadi's remembrance of the famous `Johnny U' seems like it was put together by a high school student who put wrote an outline of Unitas' career and then went to Wikipedia to get enough information to expand the outline and get a passing grade from his teacher.  There are absolutely no revelations to be found in the pages of this book.  It is so slight in its substance that you actually have to consult Wikipedia to get more information.  Its narrative flow is also so poor that reading this book is a chore.  There is nothing about his relationships with his teammates and coaches that can't be gleaned from other sources.  Each chapter seems to deal with one aspect of Unitas' career (from the early days a Louisville all the way through his unceremonious finale in San Diego), but seems impatient to move on to the next.    "...America's Quarterback" is not a total turkey, so it avoids the dreaded 1-star rating, but the overall average rating of 1.5 stars seems about right.  You would hope that anyone who takes the time of writing a book about Johnny Unitas would put the effort in the plow new ground or provide a compelling story.  Unfortunately, Sahadi does neither, and this book suffers tremendously because of that. 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 I am sorry but I was unable to watch this product as it is not for Australian viewing which I did not realise or understand at the time.  I have received a full refund for these goods but I would have rather been able to watch them.  Thank you for your help and I wish I could have done your review - Iren 
 This is not a very good book of Joan Chittister, the book feels dated and the thought patter is scattered.  I thought for sure it was written in the early 1970s with the political bent and anti-traditionalist religious life feeling.  The references to her young nun life in a community pre-molestation by experiments, is interesting as those are the very communities that are growing.  "Sister" Joan has better books; Rule of St. Benedict Insights for the Ages is superior to this particular effort. Look for that book instead 
 Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again 
 If we spoke of blacks and Jews like the other commentators speak of Christians, they would no doubt be blacklisted and widely renounced.  As it is, Mencken offers nothing to the intellectual study of religion and philosophy except for an eloquent way to say he "doesn't like it."  None the less, it would appear from the reviews of others that if you agree with Mencken's athiest world-view, you will indeed enjoy having him fuel you fire.  For me, I like a little more philosophy and a little less rhetoric 
 I checked this book out from my local library because Dadaism was mentioned in my Design class, and it sounded interesting.  I wanted to learn more about it.  I found this book to be very confusing and not very  informative at all.  It seems that they wrote this so abstract on purpose  (which they may have).  Although the final essay, lecture on dada, was  informative and the essay was, on poetry, was very good.  I'd recommend  this book just for those two lampistries 
 I don't mind that the original bleeped-out words are still bleeped on the DVDs... that's how the show was. (For example, I think the Viva La Bam DVDs would, for the most part, be funnier with the original tv bleeps.)  I don't mind that the original blacked-out and pixelated views are there... that's how the show was (and trust me, we're better for it).  With that being said, here's the real problem -- this is not presented in an as-aired episode format. Of course I should have realized that "volume" does not mean "season", but "season" is what everyone expects from a tv show DVD. That's how every other tv show is realeased; even the Wildboyz and Viva la Bam DVDs are presented in episode format.  This box set lacks because the bits are somehow funnier when viewed in context of the original episode. The recurring themes within the episodes are funnier. It's also much more convenient to sit down and watch an episode or two whenever you want. Instead, it all gets lost in the 2-hour marathon format of each "volume". Additionally, as many reviewers have mentioned, many of the classic bits are absent from this set.  Bottom line is, before you purchase this set, realize that many of the bits you remember may be missing. Also realize that each "volume" is a marathon of strung-together bits, and you will not see the actual episodes.  I suggest that die-hard Jackass fans actually not buy this set, because I think you will be more frustrated and upset in the end. Because of the "volume" format, you will probably only watch each disc once, then quickly retire it to the shelf. I regret that someone spent some good money buying this as a gift for me. I would gladly return it for only half it's original price if I could 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 Others have already said it better, but good God this book was awful. Predictable plot, stilted conversation, forced attempts to show knowledge of pop culture. What's with the random Demi Moore bashing? I bought it for 50 cents at a garage sale and overpaid. There's 6 hours of my life I'll never get back 
 I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.  I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.  I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.  When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.  I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.    Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords

 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I was very hesitant to spend close to $160 on a single fry pan, but I had heard so many good things about All-Clad and thought it would be a wise investment.  For the first 6 months, the pan was great.  I loved the large size and used it often.  I was just about ready to invest in an entire set of All-Clad cookware when my pan warped.  I was using it on an electric stove as usual, and the pan just simply warped.  I was thoroughly disappointed that a $160 pan would warp during normal use.  I won't be spending this kind of money again.  ****Follow-up.  I contacted All-Clad regarding the warped pan-they had me send it in for evaluation, and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door.  I'm impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product.  
 Several other reviewers have made comments to the effect that this book is a bit lame.  I agree but instead of regurgitating their complaints I'll specify a few of my own.    Thomas Kuhn, which the  authors talk about on pages 83-86, is listed as a hard-core relativist.  Even if one limits oneself to reading Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions this claim about him cannot be supported.  While it is true that Kuhn's work spawned consonance from many such people that shouldn't be too surprising since Kuhn's book is a work of philosophy/literature and not science.  Literature, of any sort, is particularly ripe for such abuse.  On page 86 the authors say, "We can even say that people with different conceptual schemes experience the world in different ways".  That, in a nutshell, is Kuhn's main point - and to make him out to be an Absolutist Relativist is simply not useful.  In discussing the Availability Error (pp 140-144) in confirmation bias the authors use the example of Madey & Gilovich's study using the reading of a faked diary of prophetic dreams.  "When subjects were asked to remember as many of the dreams as possible, they remembered many more of the dreams that were fulfilled than those that were not".  What they failed to account for is the fact that dreams that 'came true' were in fact mentioned in the diary twice and the ones that did not 'come true' were mentioned only once.  So that of course the students remembered 'true' dreams more often; since not only is there the "wow" factor involved in prophetic accounts coming 'true' but by repeating a story using different verbiage the effect on ones memory is more than twice as much.  This mnemonic effect is why professional journal articles have an Abstract, Body and Conclusion.    The authors do a disservice to Intelligent Design by inserting it into the discussion on Creationism (pp 189-191) and then misunderstanding it to boot.  There is no indication in the text that we've switched topics - in fact, it seems that instead of re-writing the chapter to deal with the new threat of ID the authors merely lumped in some opinions on the subject.  This has the unfortunate effect of disrupting the flow of the text.    The authors also seem to misunderstand Michael Behe's contention (cf Darwin's Black Box) that certain biochemical processes are irreducibly complex.  Most biologists, we are told, reject Behe's argument that "the parts of an irreducibly complex system could not have evolved independently of that system".  The authors commit the logical fallacy of Equivocation (see p 300 in their book) because by definition any process that is irreducibly complex cannot be built up through time given functional Independence of it parts.  If the authors really want to go head to head with the Intelligent Design ideas they should tear into Icons of Evolution - the book that does the most damage to Darwinians IMHO.    Really, almost any other book on logic/critical thinking is better than this one.  Stick with Copi's _Introduction to Logic_ (if it's still in print) and you'll be able to think circles around any weirdness you might encounter.  
 Before, i purchased this book, i saw the rating is 4.5 stars, i thought the book would be a good one. However, after purchasing the book and read through it, i regret of purchasing this book.  And the reason I regret of purchasing this book, because it's not as interest as i thought it would be.  Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems.  But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither. I almost given up reading this book many time.  The book really is boring.  I don't find it exciting as i would expected it.   In addition, I like to purchase Dr. Phil book, because i liked his show.  I thought the book should be as good as i watched the show. But it turned out opposite.  I would not buy another book from Dr. Phil.  I grade this book a C or lower, average or below average.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It's not worth the money. 
 After multiple shopping excursions leave her captivated with Amish dolls and quilts, affluent American Sue Bender attempts to impose herself on an Amish family in order to use their community as a personal spiritual retreat. The result was a pseudo-spiritual "journey" that gave rise to this short, self-indulgent, ethnocentric work.  Needless to say that Sue Bender is not an ethnographer (she is, we are repeatedly reminded, an artist), and PLAIN AND SIMPLE is not an ethnography. However, in between vapid musings, Bender squeezes in a few pages (about 40% of the book) recounting some of the experiences she had while living with two Amish families for a few months. This is the part of the book that's actually interesting. During her stay, Bender even manages to cast-off a few of her prejudgments and sterotypes about the Amish people and their culture.  Although she admits that she expected a prompt spiritual revolution, her instrospectional conclusions are still tidy and conciliatory; she resolves that it is, tragically, not in her "nature" to be "calm", and then labels this epiphany as triumphant progress. Such is the depth of her revelations that she contradicts herself when describing them. Bender's pap analysis of the Amish identifies several "paradoxes". In science, the emergence of paradoxes tends to indicate a flawed theoretical model, but Sue Bender instead chooses to cling to her convenient, superficial interpretations of the multifaceted Amish ethos (which she regards as a novelty).  Having learned so much from an Amish community in Iowa, Bender proceeds to simulate the experience by remodelling her modern kitchen entirely in synthetic materials. Years later--but only a few paragraphs after comparing herself to a "Zen monk"--she finally admits that cultivating a focused, Amish-like calm might actually require some sort of inward, self-actualized change. At least that's something.  Maybe Sue Bender will grace us all with a follow-up work in which she experiences another spiritual awakening while hat-shopping in Tibet 
 The music sounds like generic oldschool Eurobeats which is fine.  But the vocals are terrible.  He sounds like the biggest fag in the world.  They're even worse than Eiffel 65 
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 There appear to be at least 3 different versions of this DVD for sale on Amazon, each with a different price. Some reviews say the video quality is good, some say it is terrible.  It would be helpful if Amazon would indicate which version of this movie each review is associated with so that customers could decide which one to choose 
 This title is filled to the brim with propaganda and lies. The Israelis are simply doing what they need to to survive. In 1967, they struck before Egypt had a chance and the Arab powers were obliterated. In 1973 Egypt struck back, in an effort to gain their territory they had previously lost. But at the core of this conflict, and what preceded it, was the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when as soon as Israel gained independence, she was attacked ferociously by a horde of greedy Arabs. Israel repulsed them in less than a year, but the battle rages on and she is repeatedly and unprovokingly attacked (guerilla warfare and full blown battle) by the Palestinians. It doesn't seem you can convince this to the author. All that Israel has done has been in response to terrorism. Israel even gave up land (virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip) and the Palestinians are simply not appeased.  I think the author is brain dead, because this is pure stupidity and Palestinian propaganda. Don't buy it 
 The other reviewers have said it all so I won't repeat what they've said except... its lame.  Worst so far in the Masters Of Horror series 
 If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you.  However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work.  Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter.  While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions.  
 How typical that instead of debating the greatest issues facing our world today on merits, logic, and arguments; Horowitz "a angry ex-Democratic radical" now joins with the neocons in upping the scare antics to get another book on the best sellers list.  The book from the onset portrays Ms. Clinton and Mr. Soros as socialists, a term more respected than the neoconservative warmongerers who scared the American people into the invasion of Iraq.  It then goes into length about history of the Democratic Party and how it has nothing, nada good to offer. A fact which is interesting considering the author's own lovefest with the Party when he was a 60's hippie.   If Horowitz seems content in bashing his own roots so be it because that in a nutshell is what this book is about, exposing what Mr. Horowitz's considers his own shameful past.  Highly recommended for the easily brainwashed amongst us 
 It is movies like this that make me wonder if the writers/directors/producers of these Lifetime movies think about what they are implying before they just fling it up on the screen. Here we have "Odd Girl Out" the story of a high school girl who a popular clique of mean girls turn against and make her life a living hell by calling her fat and easy. And with that basic concept the filmmakers decide to call for fascism all because of their ridiculous slippery slope theory. In the world they live in, to pick on a fellow student leads directly to said student attempting suicide. Further more, their idea of a happy ending is when the principal steps in and outlaws teasing (so much for free speech). Plus, all this is on top of the fact that the victim in question, Vanessa (Alexa Vega), is weak, needy, and straight up duuuuum. The only reason the torture in allowed to endure for the entire film is because she keeps begging for it. Of course the general idea is that she just needs the approval of her peers so much that there is no limit to the amount of times she will let them crush her. Throughout the film the aggressors keep sending her links to a "Hating Vanessa" website. Vanessa, dim bulb that she is, not only takes part in her own abuse by opening them, also acts genuinely shocked by what she finds and bursts out into tears. Late in the film one character makes the fairly obvious observation of "She is so pathetic." This comes after Vanessa has cut off her hair, showed up to a nonexistent party, skipped school to avoid the harassment, and ODed on sleeping pills all while pining to be best friends with the popular girls in school. . .so it goes without saying that I agree with the statement.  The filmmaking itself was textbook Lifetime schlock. They take an issue they don't like and attack it with a stone cold seriousness. It is kind of like a Public Service Announcement only 180 times longer and minus the camp value. I would argue that their fear of anything light does hurt the point they are trying to make. For instance, the girls doing the bullying were painted as spawns of Satan without any appealing qualities. Why would Vanessa want to hangout with these humorless droids. In "thirteen" Nikki Reed's character was at least somewhat cool. It also follows the exact same formula of every other film just like it. Girl has cool friends, cool friends turn against girl, we're supposed to feel bad that girl doesn't get to have cool friends any more. I was a victim of bullying in school (who wasn't) and I think that I am a stronger person now because of it. Our public school system now only peddles uniformity not education, so all these kids can hope to really learn is people skills. How to deal with bullies, office politics, etc. After all, suffering makes us who we are. And for these irresponsible filmmakers to serve up the idea of limiting free speech just to prevent hurt feelings to an audience not known for their free thinking skills is borderline evil **1/4 
 At last Ambrose begins to tackle the massive British contribution to victory. but it is a disappointingly short and skimpy look.  Ambrose (and one notes, some US reviewers below) manages to recognise the victory at the bridge, but understates the non US contribution overall. Remember, approx 50% of all forces in Normandy were UK/Canadian/Polish etc. - and far from failing, as one reviewer below has it, they held, and ground  down, the bulk of the German forces in Normandy, enabling US forces to break out against relatively weak opposition (this is a fact, not an opinion -look it up).   Perhaps it is a little unfair to direct one's ire at this, his belated attempt to recall a few of the non US troops involved. His book on D-Day might be a more suitable object of one's scorn (4/5 about US troops alone). Yet the frustration millions of non US readers feel at being written out of their own history seeks an outlet.  It's not as if, say, UK historians - like Keegan or Neillands - have tried to minimise the US contribution in their books. All the allied armies made a huge contribution to victory. So why the chauvinism on the part of Ambrose, d'Este et al? do they feel insecure, or is it that they have fallen into mere parochialism? Thank goodness not all US historians are as narrow this.  
 Think of the worst flatware you have ever used.  Now polish it up a bit, square off the edges & you have an approximation of what this set is.  The pieces are light-weight, the edges are thin & almost sharp (uncomfortable to hold).  Even at less than $30, this set is not worth keeping, even for the RV! 
 Well, she's thorough, that's for sure.  Every possible sewing technique is covered here.  But with only line drawings for relief, it's kinda tedious to get through.  Maybe if you just wanted to look up particular techniques.  Her other books are great, but this one really leaves me cold 
 Recent players who are good get included, many great players from bygone eras get totally neglected 
 its a throw. like a blanket. i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it. it would be better than what i wasted my money on.  also dont wash this with anything else. the die leaks 
 This book is extremely basic and full of fluff.  Who needs two chapters of fonts coverage??  Reading the overly positive reviews with one line make me suspicious that the author had their friends write reviews for them to up their overall ranking. Especially the fact that the reviews keep referring to the authors by their first names only.  This book was a let down for this techie 
 Much of the information about why aid fails is in fact close to the mark.  What is said of the failure of kleptocracies in Africa is true.  However, it is somewhat irrespinsible that the perspective on this failure solely blames Africans.  As a graduate student studying all of these issues, it is apparent to me that the author doesn't make the connection between the current state of Africa and its past.  Africa is failing today because the slave trade turned African kings and mercenaries into forces that ravaged the interior, turning group against group in wars to sell prisoners to the white man.  Colonization left African nations with extractive economies, no infrastructure, no experience at ruling, and behind a hundred years in political development.  And today most African economies are still completely subject to Western markets and decisions about them. Finally, IMF Bank Structural Adjustment Programs and social austerity programs are largely to blame for enriching kleoptocratic despots, fueling wars, and spending billion on white elephant projects. Also to blame are foreign investment groups and governments who backed dictators and armies useful to their foreign policy.  Yet all of this is ignored.  Caldersi is a good read for understanding corruption, kleptocracy, waste, and hoarding...however, it is one piece of the puzzle and ultimately fails to educate the reader on the whole picture.  I recommend this book, but only in conjunction with a wider reading selection that covers the rest of the picture 
 I have heard many speak highly of the book, but I just don't get it. There is passion in his style and his delivery encouraging teachers to maintain integrity, to stay true to themselves, and so forth. I guess that I lose interest due to the verbose language used. There are many aspects to teaching, and it is a lot of work; I am not equating this aspect to success or failure for connection with the students. As I said, many that I have spoken to enjoy it... I don't 
 Q, the Winged Serpent was one of the worst movies I have even seen. I went into the film knowing it was a "B movie", but still wanting to be entertained. I was not entertained.   For a 1982 film, the gore in Q, the Winged Serpent, probably shocked quite a few people. There is also a [...] scene that is quite enticing. But aside from these two points of note, the film offered little else, including entertainment.  The acting was passable, but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out, the OK acting goes to waste.  Save your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. There are far better B movies. It is the type of movie I would have liked in college in 1987, if I had been drunk and looking for laughs. But this is 2006, and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity. You won't like Q, the Winged Serpent, at all. Even for the drunk college student, there are far better ways to spend 90 minutes. Stay away.  Total Score (out of 100) = 7  2 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

 This novel revisits the major themes of "Prep": (1) social outcast girl (2) with difficult, overly demanding father (3) grows up to believe that men cannot love her.  (4) Becomes fixated with notion that she is unattractive/boring.  (5) Has blissful car ride with unattainable hot boy who flirts during the car ride and then (6) has no contact with him for years.  (7) Has demoralizing "affair" with compulsive sex addict who pursues other women while also sleeping with her.  (8) Lacks interest in boy (tutor in "Prep," earnest boyfriend here) who worships and bores her.  Is eclipsed by prettier girls.  Obsesses with the notion that only pretty girls will ever count and she's not one of them.  (9) Takes baby steps towards "makeover" (learns to eat pasta in front of others in Prep, thereby displaying newfound confidence; loses the glasses and gets contact lenses here) but never displays any real spunk, energy, or appetite for life.    The difference is that where "Prep" is claustrophobically, stiflingly intense, and compellingly readable if lifeless, "The Man of My Dreams" is mere pallid, unsatisfying chick lit: it's a fairly lightweight, non-tragic novel about young woman coming of age & trying to find Mr. Right.  But it's chick lit without the fun accessories, the overpriced shoes, the drunken one-night stands with the wrong guy, the hilarious/reckless girlfriends, the glamorous job, the fun urban nightclubs.  Less intelligent writers like Plum Sykes have produced more satisfying fare, like "Bergdorf Blondes," because their characters have some fun and glamor.  
 I rented from Blockbuster, and the first disc available was "Disc 2" which looks possibly double sided, but only has Golden Earrings on one side.  Arguably this is not Dietrich's best early film, but my question is about the "Collection." From reading other reviews it sounds like 4 movies are on a double-sided disc called "Disc 1."  Is this the case?  Neither the Amazon listing or Blockbuster make this explicit at all, and it is rather important.  I would think there is only one release with two discs (split as above), but this is not clear from the reviews here though they have been very helpful in figuring things out.  The quality of "Disc 2" at least is poor as others have noted about the collection, however getting these movies only available on VHS now on DVD was a major attraction.  Could someone please clarify what this collection (presumably one edition only)consists of (number of discs, titles), perhaps with an ISBN number, at long last? 
 Well Im a brit and grew up watching some episodes of this when it was shown originally in the UK. I got the first region 2 UK dvd a while back and was appalled by how bad it was. My beloved doctor who stands the passage of time much better.  BEWARE THE CHEATING MEMORIES OF YOUR CHILDHOOD 
 The title of this book is misleading.  to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses  all forms of male sexuality.  This is not the case.  I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book.  The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist.  This is not the new male sexuality.  Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position.  Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques.  The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up.  there are other areas to be explored as well.  If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere 
 The review title says it all.... 
 The book has alot of great art work and teaches some inetersting points but unless you already an acomplished artist, this book will bore you,over whlem you, and mabe even discourage you.   I didn't feel the confidence the books title said it would give. Mabe I will reread it when I have the confidence in my art work to understand what the book is talking about.  Its not that its a bad book, its just filled with alot of bla bla bla and not enough instruction 
 Is there any possibility of giving this book zero stars?  What a tedious and most forgettable read!  I completely agree with the previous customer comment; this book has more to do with the business peripheral to Paul, not Paul.  But in addition to that, Alan Clayson's writing style is absolutely torturous.    The entire book is composed of weak, endless, one-sentence paragraphs that meander across perhaps five subjects, adding clause upon wandering clause, dropping name over unknown name.  By the end, you have no clue what in the world you have just read.  I had to read and re-read it until I could decipher the text's meaning.  Alan, do yourself a favor and brush-up on your basic writing skills.  I learned more about Paul in one 45 minute interview with Larry King than from this effort by Clayson.  This book, unfortunately, is a complete waste of time, and makes Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago" feel like a light and happy read 
 Don't bother buying this item.  I wish I would have read everyones reviews before we picked this up while shopping one weekend.  After about 2 weeks, you can't tune past 92.5.  Given that it starts at 88.9 everytime you start it on, that doesn't give you many options.  Sometimes it even tunes itself.  
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.   Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made.  
 Most of the allegations made in this book, usually by rightwing mudslingers rather than leftwing ones, are old smears and distortions which have been disproven by responsible journalists (sadly, a disappearing breed.) Consider the source: Alexander Cockburn is an arrogant 'cocktail party vanguard' fake leftist who's best known for wacko conspiracy theories and vicious personal attacks 
 I've read most of Ludlum's so this one was a bit disappointing.  Too formulaic and downright lazy in parts.  The dialogue was sloppy.  One too many "oh my gods" made me think the characters were more wowed than I was. Aquitane Progression and the Bourne trilogy rules 
 The New Earth Series was an awesome concept, but the implementation left something to be desired.  I have dutifully slogged through the first 4 books of the series hoping they would improve...The characterization was  good, but the plots were lame and the writing was horribly slow and  pathetic. How many times do I need to be reminded what causes Gamma Night  and how long the blackout lasts? Where in the series was it explained how  the Kauld suddenly stopped being on the verge of death? AND...Oh my GOD,  the world's in danger and we need to evacuate everybody...No, we can save  the world, but we need every ship, so we won't have any ships to evacuate  the planet. Tired. Get this one from the library, so you can return it 
 Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey. Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket 
 Suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to Rabbi David Berger's book , The Rebbe , the Messiah & the Scandal of Orthodox indifference  
 If you are not already a leftist committed to shoving your ideology down everyone else's throat, don't go anywhere near this book. Utter trash 
 I've tried many of the Yogi teas, and I really don't like the taste of this one.  I recommend the Rejuvination tea - it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging, but it has a much smoother taste 
 In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.  In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being "the other". Trying to say the "New York Jewish immigrant experience" is representative of the "immigrant experience" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.   The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't "get it". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, "indulged in incest" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: "Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition." Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.   The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously "hearing" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.  So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York 
 I really like some of Migs' earlier stuff so, I was excited when I picked this up. Man, I just don't see what's so interesting, or what those that gave this 5 stars see, in hearing the same boring electronic drum beat go on throughout 4, 5 or, 6 cuts! Just when you think it's about to stop it picks up again. I find myself waiting for to be over, or wishing I could lift it off the recording so I could listen to the music behind it. Some of Migs' stuff sits in my player for weeks. I listen to it over and over and, never get bored. With this CD, I wish I could return it 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to 
 Blue Racer: Say bug, who cares about The Bay City Rollers.

 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 This review is purposely overly harsh in an effort to achieve a counter-balance.  In truth, it deals with one, inexcusible, chapter re: The Great Queen [i.e. The Morrighan].  He *really* fummbled the ball, here (and that's being generous!).  Having read nearly all of the books listed in these authors' Bibiography, I firmly disagree with their interpretations of The Morrighan, entirely.  In essence, they seem to have been imposing their views onto the evidence at hand.  Further insulting was the way in which they extended an olive branch to Medb in an effort to completely excuse Her from War-Goddess status.  However, they refuse to extend the same grace to The Morrighan when, according to the Medieval concepot of war-fare [inter-tribal catle raids] Medb is more of a War-Goddess than The Morrighan will ever be!  Most scholars, today, seem to be referring to Her not as a War-Goddess, but as one of the following: Tutelary-/Sovereign-/Earth-Goddess.  In fact, recent academic articles by one Maire Herbert have exploded this out-dated War-Goddess model as it's applied to The Morrighan.  This out-dated model is, unfortunately, the result of early Classicist idealogy being imposed onto non-Classical Gods and Goddesses (this model stems ONLY from one article written in 1870, and has stuck ever sense, unquestioned, and undefied erroniously-so by Pagans).  He further insults any well-informed reader by calling Her a "Battle Fury" (scholars are unanimously firm in their belief that She never actually engages in battle).  Some other choice descriptions (which are abhorantly over-stepping the bounds of all reasonable research) are: She is a Goddess of a severe psychotic episodes, and that She is the personification of the cool, calculated, mentality of a serial killer!  None of this is borne out via the research!  I suggest that ANYONE interested in researching Her, turn to the following scholars (he referenced only to the last text listed, and seemed to have ignored that the author was emphatic in stating that She is an Earth-Goddess; others state She is also from a Mother-Goddess Cult, too):  * The Witch Figure -- Ed. V. Newall [Contains an article by Dr. Anne Ross] * The Concept of the Goddess -- Ed. Miranda Green [contains two academic articles by two Irish scholars which define Her as an Earth-Goddess, a genius loci, and one even blowing a part the War-Goddess model, Aspect, with no answers possible!] * The Celtic Hgeroic Age -- Ed. & Trans. John Carey & John Koch [Often defines The Morrighan strictly AS Anann, the Irish Mother-Goddess.] * The Great Queens: Irish Goddesses from the Morrighan to Cathleen Ni Houlihan -- Rosalind Clark [She has some excellent info. re: The Morighan as an Earth-/Tutelary-/Fertility-/Cow-/Sovereignty-Goddess.] * War Goddess: THe Morrighan & Her Germano-Celtic Counterpart -- Angelique Epstein [Still a good text, even though she relies far too heavily upon the now out-dated War-Goddess model; she puts Irish "warfare" into it's propper perspective, which is truly alien to the modern Pagan re: what we concieve of as "war".] * The Ancient Celts -- Barry Cunliffe  The utter nerve that he would dare state this chapter as objective research is insulting to academia, as well as to Pagans, who are taking them at their word!  His clear, unthinking bias (and hypocricy when the Medb chapter is taken into account), is clear, and unforgivible to this Pagan (and researcher)!  I don't trust him as a researcher.  In fact, his views concernign academia are lacking, for example, re: Ronald Hutton.  He doesn't understand so much about the academic community, and that Hutton is often mistaken re: his personal assumptions.  But, McColman merely writes any of his critics off (who question anything he writes, no matter how miniscule) as "not knowing what they're talking about!"  No researcher would (especially an academic) would be so foolish!  Any truly advanced student in the subject will quickly see the huge problems concerning this book and how he type-casts the Gods (which is academically inexcusible!) 
 This is NOT what I expected.  I thought this was going to be a "documentary".  I thought this was going to show the kids being booked, wearing the prison uniforms, eating with the inmates, going to the yard, and then being locked in their cells.  None of that happened. Instead, this entire film was shot in one room, with the kids in a big circle, and the inmates or (lifers), lecturing and yelling in their faces, about getting raped, shanked, and beaten to death in prison. This is a good educational film to show at special schools for troubled youth.  Or the Y.M.C.A.. This is not a movie to watch for fun or entertainment 
 This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach! Brigham & Company will take 30 pages to explain a concept that can be done in 2 pages. I used this book for my finance class for my MBA; this one is not worth the money or your time. 
 This book may be as well called "the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls".  The author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories.  However, if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to David Allen's "Getting Things Done", you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can 
 I encountered this wildly overpraised critical study in college. I've should have known I was getting into trouble just by the stupid title. Hoffman's attempts at humor are lame (Camille Paglia is far more livlier  and insightful on Poe in her book "Sexual Personae")and his  insights pitiful (Paul Coates, in "The Realist Fantasy", gives a  much more subtle reading of Poe's "William Wilson" in just three  paragraphs than Hoffman is able to accomplish). What really undermines the  whole book is Hoffman's complete ignorance of fantastic literature which I  think would be essential to doing a critical study of Poe. Only passing  mention is made of E.T.A. Hoffmann, a major influence on Poe (and among  other great writers). Consequently the influence of Hoffmann's doppelganger  tales (such as "The Double" and "Devil's Elixirs") on  Poe's doppelganger tales ("William Wilson" and "The Black  Cat" among other tales)and their influence on such short story writers  as Borges, Paul Bowles, and Julio Cortazar, is not mentioned because Daniel  Hoffman is ignorant of it all and the whole genre. And his conclusion that  Poe only wrote "pure" tales devoid of any inner meaning is pure  bunk and pure laziness on Hoffman's part. To any unfortunate reader or  student who picks up Hoffman's book expecting any critical acumen be  warned: this book isn't it. Two other critical studies (David Ketterer, J.  Gerald Kennedy) are far better 
 I had high hopes for this, but three major flaws contributed to it being returned:  1) The display is extremely bright. I ended up covering it with a t-shirt, just to be able to get to sleep. 2) Even though bright, the display cannot be read unless you are close and at the correct angle. 3) The sounds quality was surprisingly bad. I knew this wasn't a fancy, expensive model, but the sound was unbearably distorted, especially at lower volumes (e.g. you want your ipod music on in the background). I though my ipod battery was dead at first, but apparently the speakers on this unit are just that bad.  So it fails as a clock, and as an iPod player. I never tried the radio function, but even if that was excellent it would not have saved the product from being returned 
 4 thumbs down, way down.  this is a bad book, the writer tries to convince you with his statistics while he doesn't know statistics 
 A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.  I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read.  It didn't.  It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104.  I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings.  I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail.  But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had.  Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections.  This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me 
  This book is long and boring account of an intelligence officer who served as director of mossad. I was expecting inside details of mossad operations instead author details how he personally contributed to some major breakthroughs in Middle East peace process. The account of details is ridden with narcissism and vanity. All in all not a good read 
 So what happens with these people die lol? All this money and "help" will have died in vain as will the three in jail trying to prove their innocence. You know, the amount of tax money funding these organization to help these people is probably a waste also. . . I mean come on. . . It isn't like they if freed from jail are going to go out and do great things (Cure cancer, stop war ((which would be a bad thing)) or any of that stuff.) Seems like a BIG waste of time and money to free these poor poor 3 people from jail 
 The author is not entirely forth-coming about his affiliations.  He is, in fact, a minister in the Unity Church, a branch of Christianity that has come through the New Thought movement.  So when he says that he wants to construct a new Christianity, it seems to me that he has one in mind.  If you know anything about Unity, the proposed tenets of his "enlightened Christianity" will sound familiar to you.  I'm not saying the author isn't entitled to his perspective, I just would have liked to have been aware of it going in, or at least had it disclosed when he talked about Unity and New Thought.  That said, the reason I read this book was because I had previously read Laughlin's "Remedial Christianity" and found him to be a good communicator and teacher.  I had some serious disagreements with him in that book, and a couple of those persisted into this book (such as his presentation of immanence and transendence, which I think fails to hear all that traditional Christianity would like to claim about the immanence of God), but on the whole Laughlin maintains the clarity of presentation and strong knowledge of his subject matter in this book.  It is this book's greatest strength.  I came into this book with some knowledge of the Eastern faiths being described, and the author's presentation is generally consistent with what I had heard before and he had much to add to what I knew.  The section on Hinduism seemed to me to be the strongest in the book.  He does a great job of making sense of a wide variety of beliefs and practices.  The section on Buddhism seemed a little weaker with regard to beliefs, focusing more on practices, but that may be because Buddhism doesn't have a lot of specific beliefs.    The section on Chinese religions left me wondering if maybe Laughlin didn't have quite as deep an understaning of this.  His comparisons of Confucianism and Taoism to strains of popular American culture (nearly granting hippies full Taoist status) didn't quite fit with my understanding of these philosophies in anything but a superficial way.  I was left wondering if this section got less revision and rethinking than the others.  Finally, I didn't have much use for his chapter reconstructing Christianity to be an Eastern religion.  I do think that there is much that Christianity can learn from dialogue with these other religions, but I think a far better approach would be to look for minor threads within the Christian tradition that could be highlighted in light of Eastern teachings rather than the wholesale replacement of major doctrines that Laughlin proposes 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 It lights up and then goes out, the clear and redeal does not work.   Just can't play the game 
 It has been almost 3 decades since I have taken a math course of any type, so, after a co-worker gave me this book, I began thinking that I had completely lost it!  I am 45 and headed back to college and wanted to "brush up" on old skills.  I was considered pretty bright in math when I was younger and grasped concepts readily.  While trying to work my way through this book, I ordered another book from Amazon, Algebra & Trigonometry (second edition) by Blitzer, in order to see if I could self teach Trig., and amazing things began to happen. IT (the Blitzer book) made sense!  It also wasn't bogged down with examples that required a calculator to check if you grasped the concept.  Once you understand the concept, entering data into a calculator should just be a method of saving time on large complex problems.  Math hasn't change over the decades, but reliance on graphing calculators seems to have changed the method of teaching it.  We no longer seem to teach understanding, or at least this book (Intermediate Algebra) didn't.  No wonder we are becoming innumerate in this country!  I am greatly concerned for anyone who attempts to LEARN from this book, especially by self-teaching 
 as a loan officer in training this book has been a great tool in my lerning ,it explain in detail and clear how to do your job step by step, and how to avoid mistakes,i am glad that i found this book and recommended to any one interested in lerning about the mortgage business 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 Years ago, the trainer of my 3-months old coonhound recommended staying away from this book, describing it as "the best way to get your dog to be afraid of you and mess up your relationship forever!".  But I wanted to read it, to know what it was all about... I cannot tell you how many times I was fuming realizing how ignorantly these Monks approach dogs' psychology and the physical and psychological violence they use. The temptation of throwing that piece of junk out the window was strong, but I read it through to make sure I could talk about it as bad as I can with the knowledge of its contents. I am saddened to find out that they are still out there... This is the training philosophy for frustrated humans that need to dominate to compensate their own insecurities.  Meanwhile I am a trainer myself and I support a more constructive approach to dog training based on positive reinforcement.  If you know nothing about dogs' psychology, and want to learn more from "The Voice" in dog behavior I suggest "The Other End of the Leash" by Patricia McConnell or "Culture Clash"  by Jean Donaldson or "The Power of Positive Dog Training" by Pat Miller. If you would like to become a benevolent leader of the pack without imposing yourself to your dog with violence or fear, I suggest "How to be the Leader of the Pack...And have Your Dog Love You for It" ("How to" booklets from Dog's Best Friend) by Patricia B. McConnell. All these books are written by professionals that have been working with dogs and studying dogs' behaviors, but they are very entertaining and easy to read and comprehend. Patricia McConnell also wrote a number of other books addressing specific behavioral issues.   
 The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).  Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway 
 I read Kozol to actually be amused. It saddens me to think that colleges force students to read books like these. Young minds take this at face value. I am a native New Yorker, from Brooklyn. My parents were working class, and we had no extras. What I hate most about Kozol is his obvious white guilt. He never talks about personal responsibility. It is just the city not taking care of the poor and needy. That is the problem with most liberals, they offer opinions, work on the emotions of people, and never offer solutions. When mayor Giuliani wanted welfare workers to work, IE pick up leaves in the park, there was a great outcry-well, when I was in college, I worked cleaning up after horses-just to pay for part of tuition, and I waited tables, ETC. Why should they not work if they are getting a check? He also talks about how the suburbs spent more money per child in the school system-yet he never mentions what those parents in the suburbs spent each year on taxes--There is a lot more I could write, but I would be here all day. Take it from a native New Yorker who worked as a teacher in the South Bronx-he plays on your feelings, but in the end, by portraying poor people as victims he gives people a way to "blame the system," and insults every hardworking person who has improved his or her life 
 I honestly can't review the whole CD because I have only heard Step Up.  It was on the The Late Show with Jay Leno.... I whole song was terrible.  The dancing was awful.  I am not a pop fan by anymeans but this was a joke.  In fact I thought this was a joke - a play off of The Pussy Cat Dolls - until I realized that this is a "real legitement" band....  This does nothing but deteriorate the music scene as a whole.  It floods the market with crap.  yuck - no thank you, even the teenie boppers could find something better to listen to 
 This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself.  The "fabulous" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions.  The "natural" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate.  Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes 
 The quality and cost of the book was quite disappointing. The pages that were stapled in the book were out of order and other pages were falling out. The first impression was not good.  The content was "ok" but not practical for the introverts that struggle to begin a conversation. If you want to spend this amount on a communication book and learn important details in communicating, I suggest ordering Conversationally Speaking that lists how others perceive you as you converse and how to read others' "signals" during a conversation. Another suggestion is How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less that also gave better advise on conversations than this pocket guide. 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 Bil Keane is an insensitive megalomaniac. The children in "A family circus" are obviouly autistic or suffer some other sort of terrible mental affliction. And yet this "man" mocks their shortcomings. There is a special place in hell for Bil Keane 
 We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it.. 
 Although this book contains good information, it is tinted by the fact that one of the authors, Robert Portman, sells sports nutrition products. As a result, the impression is that the goal of this book is to prove that Mr. Portman's products are the best. Maybe they are but then, it would be more credible if the book was written by independent researchers 
 The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "500 comic book villains" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.   However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house 
 I echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here: The magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week.  How many times is a reader going to see no talents such as Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, the Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes joke, and THE most overrated, overhyped people of all time Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the cover and not get tired of it?    It's nice to know what's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week?  Can you say "overkill?"  I'm glad I never got a subscription to this magazine.  I picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because I was so sick and tired of reading about overrated, overhyped and glorified B-movie "actors" and "actresses" who were lucky to be in one successful movie and haven't done anything of value since.    I picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever.  Don't waste your time or your money. - Donna Di Giacom 
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 I had (notice the past tense) a girlfriend who loved this movie and brought it over one night for us to watch. The way she described it made me really want to see it. Unfortunately, her sales skills far surpassed anything the movie had to offer. I was under the impression that this was a comedy - and I really enjoy comedies - but the comedic moments were few and very far between.   Part of the fault for the sad overall outcome of this movie must lie with the editor. The movie could have flowed far better, been easier to follow, and been funnier with proper editing. 
 When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back 
 I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.  The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!! 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 Un-Christianlike methods used here! I wouldn't recommend to anybody that they read stuff about a religion from the enemies of that religion! People should study books and literature from their own religion, put out by their leaders, to find out what they believe! Or, as my 17 year old son likes to say, "Why would you ask a lawyer how to do the work of a doctor?"  I believe the author can't be satisfied, or at peace, as long as it is possible that the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is true.   The Book of Mormon is simply an ancient "journal" of people in another land that Christ visited. Why would God not check on and visit all people in all ages? That's what I find hard to believe, that God only spoke to prophets before Christ, but not after? Hmm. Why would He do that to us? I don't think a loving God would. Do you?  As far as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints claim that the Bible may not have been translated 100%  correctly, is that NOT possible? Over the thousands of years that the Bible has been translated over and over, and handed down from priest to priest, do you honestly believe that no word or phrase ever got mixed up? Not even once? I'd like to know how Ron can PROVE that no mistake was ever made in the translation of the Bible, or any of his other claims against the Mormon church. He should spend his time reading the Bible and praying, instead of looking for FALSEHOODS about a good Christian church 
 Oh Come on. I've been reading/following this religiously for the last 8 months and have NO relief for my ailments. And I don't mean serious like cancer, just the measurable things like allergies and joint pain. What's up? Ever hear of quack medicine 
 This textbook is horrible!  It makes relatively easy statistical concepts unbearably confusing and over-complicated.  I used this textbook for a graduate-level class, yet found myself constantly referring to my statistics notes from undergraduate classes--which I think is pretty sad.  The only reason this text got more than one star is due to the many tables and charts listed in the back.  They were the one semi-decent portion of the book.  Caveat Emptor--Buyer Beware 
 I grew up watching these all star disaster movies and even if this one is bottom of the barrel, it's fun to watch. If you want something that makes sense look someplace else,but if very bad disaster movies are your thing then kick back and enjoy 
 FOR SOME REASON, THIS REVIEW SHOWS ONE STAR INSTEAD OF THE FIVE I GAVE IT! This is a major rethinking of theory of language by a professor of German literature. I have never seen it referred to in the literature, and that is a terrible, sinful omission. Ellis's identifying CATEGORIZATION as the major element of language, and subjecting this view to a very close scrutiny, deserves the attention of linguists, philosophers of language, psychologists, and mathematicians--among others. My only criticisms (and it is not trivial) is that Ellis's perspective is entirely "adultocentric" (see my The Unboundaried Self) 
 A lot has been written about this album, some good, some bad. This album (by U2 standards)is mediocre. Bono says himself that if they were starting out today and they released this as a second album, they would be dropped by the record label. A few highlights here like 'Fire','Gloria' and maybe at a push 'October', but other than that, nothing to write home about. Steve Lillywhite's production is raw and uneventful and the recording was 'rushed'. It is true that Bono's lyrics were stolen prior to recording which put added pressure on the limited resources that they had at the time. One to complete the collection but will probably not hit the CD-player too often 
 who is this girl? this is not the same tomboy/dorky Gwen i know in a band called No Doubt. her image has totally changed and i dont like it. she cares too much of what people think of her now. with no doubt all their songs were deep in meaning and actually meant something! this **** is bananas. i could have wrote that!! no offense to gwen or anything, i luv her 2 death and im the hugest fan of no doubt but i cant accept her new pop sound. it just blends in with all the other artists 
 I've been a David Benoit fan since the early 80s, and unfortunately, this latest recording comes nowhere close to the quality of his earlier efforts.  I get the feeling this was a contract fulfillment for GRP--I believe Benoit is now with Peak Records, where hopefully he'll regain some of freedom to record the adventurous and tasteful music he's recorded in the past.  This latest effort is almost as bland and faceless as most $mooth Jazz on the radio today--I can barely tell this is a David Benoit recording, he's so buried in the mix.  Rick Braun's heavy, slick "formula" over-production does not win any points here and, in my opinion, is a lot of the problem with this recording:  it panders to the $mooth Jazz crowd, not contemporary jazz fans (such as myself) who value melody and musicianship over fitting a radio-friendly formula.  I get the feeling I'm listening to a Rick Braun recording with Benoit as guest artist...and this is not a good thing!  For instance, this is the blandest cover of "Watermelon Man" I've ever heard.  I'm waiting for Benoit to give us another excellent album like "Letter To Evan", where he displays his considerable piano chops and yet, still gives us memorable melodies of his own, and his unique cover versions of others' tunes done in his inimitable contemporary style.  Skip this one unless you're a completist (like I am); if you're just starting out, get one of GRP's compilations, or pick up a few choice gems from his 80s and early 90s catalog.  
 This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.  The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.  I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose 
 Believe it or not there was red stuff inside!!!!!  Today I unscrew my "Brita Ultra Faucet Filter System". Well, I was shocked to discover that  inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing.   I called Brita and was told that it is not the product, SINCE IT IS NOT EVEN DESIGNED TO FILTER OUT BACTERIA, it must be the water. Long story short: Brita still pushes it product on people who doesn't know better.   This product is poorly designed and drains bad, therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it. Since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one.   IF you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out. Neither did I, you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo.  Stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality. 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 This book was simply a waste of my time. No significant information 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 True Crime has always interested me;particulayly what made these criminals tick.There,s lots of speculation about their thinking;but never many resolutions;particularly with the loners.This book was very disapointing.the text was very poor,disjointed and difficult in connecting with the photos.If this book shows anything,it is that the photography was much better in the past than recent times.Sure, there was some pretty gruesome stuff,but there is more to the art of crime photography than presented in this book.Before buying ,I would suggest giving it a pretty good look over.I was quite surprised by the high reviews this book received;however,considering the background of the authors;maybe it is a better book for the insiders of crime photography.But then,who do they do this work for,themselves or others? the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words doesn't hold here.Most shots are like snapshots taken by amateurs who just happen to be passing and took a shot 
 All I could think was, "Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed." I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. I only ended up feeling more depressed. As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.   If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well 
 I loved the Little House books as a girl, and actually just read the last in the series this week.  I started with The Long Winter, and ended with this book, as I recently purchased the set of nine books for my children.    I wish that I had not read this book!  The entire book is depressing.  I feel that it spoils the lovely ending in These Happy Golden Years.  Yes, we can't help wanting to know what happens to Laura after she is married.  However, I really wish this book was published separately, as it really does not go with the set. None of her other books are depressing!  There is always happiness in the other books, even in the face of challenges.   As another reviewer stated, this book begins by re-telling the wedding proposal, but it contradicts the version in These Happy Golden Years.  Also, the overall voice of the writer is not the same as the other books.  There are also parts that are confusing, and not well written.  It is a fact that Wilder did not edit this for printing, and it is obvious that she did not intend to publish this. After only a few pages I really felt that she didn't even write it, that is how different it is 
 This movie is the worst ever it has nothing to do with shaolin stuff, it's a story about a cop who got stuck with a ghost and it has bad acting,stupid story and not funny at all, so it's nothing at all like shaolin soccer so you better save your money 
 the TRUTH. This is the third book of Ms. Meades I have read and again stockpiled with errors. She tried to be scandalous, but comes of as a gossip. There is only one word of advice I have for Ms. Meade: RESEARCH.  I know you'll have to look that one up 
 I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.   Lesson learned.  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.   While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.   The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener 
 MGM has made the weak decision to release this wonderful film in the cut-to-shreds R-rated version, instead of the Special Unrated Version, in all its original uncut unrated splendor. MGM blows! Don't waste your money, just wait for the Special Unrated Version. Some company of worth will release it soon, we hope 
 Rather than a concise history of the Middle East this book offers only 146 pages of brief summary of outside powers effects on the region.  This isn't a history of the Middle East, it's a history of how Europe, the US and the Soviet Union interacted with the Middle East. Though undeniably important in understanding the region, Western and Eastern relations with the Middle East are not the only reasons for studying it. There is more going on, far more, that Shlaim does not address, and it opens a large crediblility gap.  What is missing? A lot.  This might be a good book if it's only goal were to teach people a very concise history of Western and Eastern relations to the Middle East, so perhaps it is just poorly titled. The information that it did offer though seemed good enough, and it provided a fair overview of US relations with the Middle East, but I expected more and was dissapointed 
 I really thought this book would be a little more helpful but it is vague and not very detailed 
 The book "Medicine River" is awash with too many characters and no true plot on which to base the complexities that surround most of these characters. There is too much happening and not enough book to cover it, or enough words to explain it all, which makes the story come across as choppy and irrational. If someone is going to write a novel with over 30 characters, than please, write a trilogy - please don't jam a bunch of nonsensical blather into only 261 pages. Not to mention, many of the scenes leave you feeling as though you've missed something - the human and lifelike qualities that any developed characters should have in a novel. It leaves this book dull and devoid of any true feeling. Although there is a main insight into the book upon how a community can become family over a biological family that one may not possess, this book leaves you feeling like you really have read a fictitious novel, which I don't think was the intention the author had. Too bad 
 Now that the editorial review is up, you will not make the mistake that I did when all I had to go on was the title. The only difference that I can see: a two-page preface that tells us why the book is being reissued under another title. Since I ordered a new copy of _Invisible Republic_ at the very same time I ordered this book, I am (having fetched it from the post office five minutes ago) more than a little miffed 
 Nothing in the description indicates that this is heavily abridged. The introduction (after you've purchased the book) actually refers to this version not as translated (no translator is credited) but paraphrased. It is not even partitioned into St. Augustine's original 13 "books," but is instead resectioned with "new" chapter titles. I had to repurchase the book 
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 It appears the author has no idea what is going on with concepts of PLs. For example, he doesn't even touch on the ideas of follow sets and predictive parsing. His coverage of BNF and EBNF is light, at best, and it seems this topical coverage permiates the whole book.   As any CS student or educator knows, "Concepts of" books tend to be dense and difficult to read. This author attempts to make the material more readable at the cost of detail. Unfortunatley, the detail he leaves out is necessary.  I would also argue that the author doesn't have a strong understanding of PLs. The concepts he presents toward the begining on PL evaluation are incomplete. He doesn't fully express all of the important criteria in language evaluation.  Overall, if you are looking for a brief, topical INTRODUCTION to programming languages, this may be the book for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it 
  First of all, the trailer was the best part of the movie & had me expecting a totally different story ...   Second, the story I got turned out to be the "Grinch Who Stole Christmas" crossed with "It's A Wonderful Life" (the latter of which was even more boring than this hokey remake) & doesn't that therefore make "Santa Clause 3" SO cliche & SO done before?!  Third, the kids in the audience seemed to enjoy it, but MAN was I bored! (& I actually enjoyed the original Santa Clause, so I can't blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids' movie ... )  Fourth, I found the Christmas council to be extremely offensive (read: inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about Christmas).  *****WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP!*****SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!*****READ NO FARTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE!*****  Fifth, I found Jack Frost's conversion to be ...   zzzzzzzzzzz  Whazzat? Oof. I must have dozed off for a minute. Sorry. Now what was I saying? Oh yeah. Poor, pitiful, evil Jack Frost.  (ho hum)  Wouldn't it have been much better to kill him off than convert him? I mean, come ON. Is the converted Jack Frost supposed to be an improvement? YUCKY. He's disgusting! I liked him much better as a villain. Better hair. Better duds. I say: just freeze him off next to a wooly mammoth & be done with him. Or bring him back in next year's sequel (because you know there's going to be one). For goodness' sake. Do we always have to embrace our inner icicle? (hurl)  & sixth -- not only Jack -- but there was SO much about this movie that just didn't make sense!   (yawn)  Okay, I'm done with it. It's not even worth the time I took for it ... 
 I ordered this once, the order got cancelled, and I hurriedly ordered it again, so eager was I to read it based on what I'd heard. What I'd heard was wrong. In addition to rambling on about himself and/or nothing, Armstrong offers only warmed-over advice from other published books on writing. That's right, he's done no original research with any primary sources whatsoever. He takes lots of advice from King's _On Writing_ (making sure also to tell us in detail about King's van accident and how the driver was found dead the following year...and what does this have to do with advice on how not to write a novel?) and plenty of mildly relevant personal experiences, such as joining the Crime Writers' Association (though he didn't have much time to devote to it because he'd just started a new romantic relationship, you see). The advice he offers isn't bad (with one exception), but you could easily cut out the middleman by buying this advice in its original packaging rather than Amrstrong's dull recycling.  The exception to the good advice is the repeatd mantra: Don't do it. Don't be a writer. Just don't do it, you'll regret it, and so on. This would have been clever once or twice, but he does it over and over and over again. Excuse me, but if I weren't serious about writing I probably wouldn't have bought your f*cking book, now, would I? As if a single book is going to talk me--or anybody else--out of it.   This is minor compared to the other flaws the book contains, but Armstrong and/or his editor have absolutely no idea how to punctuate. He sprinkles commas, liberally, throughout, to the point where, they make no sense and, slow down, or stop your comprehension. This leads as well to some truly leviathan sentences--I counted no fewer than 9 clauses in one of them. Sheesh 
 I really wish Amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash.  Some less than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my collection!"  HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!! 
 I just returned from a 2 week trip to the Yucatan peninsula. Starting off in Cancun and driving the cultural triangle route to the east to visit the Mayan ruins (Chichen Itza, Coba, Uxmal etc... and Spanish colonial cities (Merida, Valladolid etc...). For professional reasons I took along 4 travel guides (The Rough Guide to Cancun & Cozumel, DK's Eyewitness Top 10 Cancun & The Yucatan, Hidden Cancun & the Yucatan, and the Cadogan Yucatan & Mayan Mexico. In the past I've also used the frustrating Moon guide and weak Lonely Planet).   Of the 4 guides, each quite different in focus and style, I found "Hidden Cancun and the Yucatan" undoubtedly the most annoying and rate it 2 stars. Perhaps it's a bit stingy with the stars - other people have given it 5 stars, but with several other guides to compare it to, it's weaknesses became more and more apparent. Neither a good detailed history of the region nor particularly interesting or detailed in describing towns, cities and Mayan sites. The "Cadogan Yucatan & Mayan Mexico" though slightly larger and heavier was in a different league and perhaps the best book on the region for these purposes but also immensely enjoyable and readable with many excellent recommendations for food and accommodation.  The format "Hidden Cancun and the Yucatan" (a largish thick paperback seems) to suggest the same purpose but I think did a mediocre haphazard job. Even as a reference guide it fails to deliver with a pathetic lack of photographs and maps - those provided were as good as useless for reference (instead The rough Guide and Top 10 were infinitely superior and genuinely useful). By contrast, the reference information in "Hidden" is so poorly layed out and not conveniently accessible - excuse the pun, but without much better visuals, layout and concise text, "Hidden" does a good job of hiding it's information - not good when one is on the fly. For example different towns and villages were blended in a linear text dictated by routes (for example drivngh from Cancun to Playa del Carmen), so information for a given place you might want to visit might start at the bottom of a left page and run over the next without the name place ever making it to the top of the page. Places to dine, stay or shop would haphazardly fall wherever the text put them, never in sections starting a page top or in any consistent structural order. Perhaps the idea was to list everything in a rambling travelogue, place drifting into place running north to south, east to west, broken down by region. I just thought it made the book frustratingly inflexible and to idiosyncratic.   By the way, why on earth produce a guide book for use in the tropics on cheap uncoated paper? Perhaps because they publishers decided to give the traveler only 4 pages of photographs. This book really absorbed moisture and seemed to get heavier and heavier! I know that sounds silly but simple details like trying to turn a page when they seem to cling together in the humidity added to my wondering about the wisdom behind this book.   The 'hidden" part, the supposed trump card of this guide is of dubious merit. The "hidden" discoveries were few and far between, disappointing on the odd occasion I checked them out (I stopped after realizing that they weren't so special) and just not strong enough to hang the (title) concept of a travel book (series). Indeed  I often found the 2004 version very dated and in the course of traveling, made far more interesting discoveries of my own. By contrast, "The Rough Guide" and "Top 10", both thin compact picture filled books with plenty of good maps and guides also contained far more recommendations of places to eat, stay and visit in a concise, coherent well layed out and easier to navigate manner that "Hidden Cancun & Yucatan" lacks. My girlfrined and I felt that they both immensely increased our interest in visiting various restaurants, Mayan sites, colonial towns, beaches, churches etc... In conjunction with the "Cadogan Yucatan" we were very well informed culturally, historically, visually and geographically. The 2 small pocket guides were excellent for walking about with when we left "Cadogan" and "Hidden" in the car - though we'd often bring "Cadogan" with us anyway because we couldn't stop reading it.   Another thing that I found grating and contrary to the "hidden" concept was the authors occasional statements of his personal preferences in side bars. Normally it's great to get another traveler's insights, but personally I found the actual comments annoying. For example, I strongly question how a writer appealing to people seeking out hidden and undiscovered corners of the Yucatan can suggest that Palya del Carmen's beach is his favorite on the Mayan Riviera. Maybe it was different when he was last there a couple of years ago. Another dated reference (or just downright crass) was his reference to the actual pueblo of Tulum as "a drab eye-blink off the highway, with a few stores, a taco shop and a palapa-roofed church". Instead we are treated to the authors name dropping of personalities he's rubbed shoulders with at Maya Tulum, a chic place on the beach. In fact the pueblo of Tulum is a fast growing little town with an impressively paved main street with many interesting shops including a large "Misik Artesanias" (another smaller one is on the beach) and the adjoining palapa-roofed "Charlie's". There are a couple of big bank branches (HSBC and Banamex) with ATM machines, a couple of laundromats, an excellent large supermarket at the entrance to town (opposite the road down to the beach). Get my point? This is a fast growing town that is trying to make itself interesting and attractive without making itself into another souless eurotrash hole like Palaye del Carmen. How long ago did Richard Harris write his review? Is he aware that a 4 lane road is being constructed between Tulum and Coba (and onto Valladolid) and an international airport in pre-construction there? This may be a particularly dramatic place for change but my point is that the book was often out of date and unfocused 
 Page 328: "... For example, out of a worldwide total of $9 trillion in international bank loans and deposits in 2001, only about $700 billion went to poor countries-less than one percent. Out of $12 trillion in international investment securities, only about $600 billion went to poor countries, an even smaller fraction of one percent. ..."  I really enjoyed this book until I read this passage, now I'm doubting everything I've ever learned about math 
 I expected good things from this book, but was surprised to find it offered very little useful advice.  The examples of what to do in certain situations must have been jokes, they were that inappropriate and irrelevant to real life.  Amazingly, the book was also racist at times, making odd comments about Muslims.  I actually tossed this book in the garbage, a first for me. 
 Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable.  Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories.  His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology.  But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples.  The result is just not compelling reading.  And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics.  Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions.  This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics 
 No new material, just a recap of things already seen.  A complete waste of money.  Interestingly, the description on the back was exactly the same as vol.2 .  Maybe they were trying to send a warning.  If you can find a way to get your money back, do so 
 It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H)  get more attention and love outside of the US than in it. I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.   To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films. If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster!! Why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-A prints!!!  
 I know first hand this book is filled with alot of untruths.I was personally affected by the lies in this book. It would have been a good book if sold as non fiction. He should of left the names of people out of the book if he wasnt sure if he was printing the truth. I hope next time he writes a book he gets his facts straight before printing someones name and a bunch of lies 
 After 20+ years of owning a Cuisinart, I switched to this food processor because of concerns over Cuisinart quality.  What a mistake this food processor is, especially if you want to use it for making bread. -  Dough does not ball up in this unless you run it forever, and even then the kneading is not as smooth as with a Cuisinart. -  The mini-bowl is a pain to remove. -  The unit is massively heavy, even moving it forward a couple of inches on the counter is a chore. - The rubber feet stick to the counter and get dislodged when moving the unit. - Huge chunks are left over between the blade and the lid when gratign or slicing.  Do I like anything about it?  No. This is a dog, buyers beware 
 I'm reading reviews and I'm beginning to wonder if I even know what's good anymore. I see cats referring to this album as "perfect", "sick", and "excellent" when what I'm hearing is nothing more than "okay."  If you regularly listen to hip hop and you think this is "sick" or "excellent", then you probably haven't been listening to hip hop for very long. Apparently all it takes nowadays for a dude to be considered nice is a decent beat and a borrowed flow. In this case, we're borrowing from some guy named Shawn. I mean, literally, this sounds like Jay Z has a cold and stuffed tissue up his nose before went in the booth (and he had the nerve to make a song like "Mirror Mirror") -- just listen to "A Day In The Life" and you'll know I'm not lying. The production, on the other hand, isn't necessarily bad, but 9th's sound is getting repetitive. I was on the 9th Wonder bandwagon after copping The Listening a few years ago, but now I think I've had my fill. Despite what you may think, EVERY producer has throw away beats and 9th is no exception. This album is proof of that.   With all that said, it would be unfair of me not to point out the good as well as the bad. There are a couple joints on the album where Sky switches up from the "hustler of week" themes and drops something worth hearing. A perfect example of that would be "Extreme Measures", "You & Me", and "Stop Fooling Yourself" -- Sky and 9th both put some effort into what they're doing on those joints. There are a few others, but none really worth mentioning.   Cloud 9: The 3 Day High is pretty much a forgettable release from Skyzoo. I listened to this at least 8 times in hopes I'd hear what everyone else was talking about, but it never happened. My pointer finger hurts from all the skipping I was doing. You really shouldn't have to force yourself to like something. Nor should an album have to "grow" on you (another way of saying you forced yourself to like it because it didn't hit you the first time). Imagine if Illmatic or Liquid Swords had to "grow" on you. If you're one of those people, you're no different from clear channel or any other radio station. They use repetition too. I'd tell you to get this if you were a 9th Wonder fan, but you've heard better from him too. No, the album isn't wack, but it's the audio equivalent of Nyquil. I recommend downloading this and testing it out before actually paying for it.   Standout Tracks: Stop Fooling Yourself (My Favorite), You & Me, and Extreme Measure 
 Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.  The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and  said "I'm John Kerry reporting for duty." 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune.  More like "I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment." OR "I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home."  As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!  What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to  install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.  So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science.  
 I bought this CD thinking it was a music CD. Wrong! It was about someone reveiwing the group Panic at the Disco. Apart from background music there was no music what so ever on this CD.  If you are interested in background info on a group then buy this CD. However, if like me, you like listening to music do not buy this CD 
 I'll admit, I am a bit new to power Linux but I consider myself competent. The essential problem with the book is Jeff tries to present examples without any background or information. In chapter 3, the book jumps right into configuring UML from the host using 'uml_mconsole' withot telling the reader where to get it or how to compile it. This coupled with the lack of web resources associated with the book, makes it very hard to keep rolling with lessons.   Another example is the use of tap interfaces. tap interfaces don't just automagically appear when you start a linux box, they must be configured. Jeff makes no attempt to eductate the user on how to accomplish this and has no resource to go to for help.  I am using CentOS4 with kernel 2.6.9-34. Perhaps not the most up-to-date version but it should be adequate. I would have expected to find some pointers to usable kernels and root filesystems with which to experiment. Instead I find I spend most of my time fetching kernels and packages and building what I need, not by instruction in the book, but by info found through a Google search.  Who edited this book anyway? Did you even bother to try some of the "lessons" Jeff provided. I don't care that Jeff created UML, he doesn't hack it as an author. Spend your money on hookers and booze, the experience will certainly be more satisfying 
 This book is so outdated. All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past. There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books 
 I just read this book in a college class. I love to read and this book put me to sleep. I would not tell anyone to read this book 
 Granted, this book is 12 years old, so it's going to be outdated.  But many of Stoll's predictions and insights about the internet simply never came to pass.  For instance, he claims that "few aspects of daily life require computers... they're irrelevant to cooking, driving, visiting, negotiating, eating, hiking, dancing, speaking, and gossiping."  Not true.  I've gotten countless wonderful recipes online, I wouldn't think of planning a trip without consulting an online map site, and I've learned more about different hiking trails via conservation websites than I would have ever come across in books or magazines.  I understand that computers are not an absolute necessity.  But I don't know what I would do without quick, easy, and inexpensive access to the information available on the internet these days.  And that's saying nothing of e-commerce, which has revolutionized the trade of goods in this country over the last decade or so.  Sorry, Cliff, but you were way off on this one 
 After reading "The Dark Side of the Light Chasers," I expected the same level of insight in this volume.  Instead, I found a smorgasbord of various religions that didn't really seem to do justice to any particular one.  I realize this book is more self-help and self-discovery oriented, but the spiritual overtones were too strong and too garbled to be of any real help.  Ford is a good writer, and she does have some helpful insights on personal care habits, so I give this one two stars 
 This is surely one of the nastiest little films ever made.  It is a waste of a handsome young actor, John Shepherd, who plays a very troubled and closeted construction worker, David.  He is secretly in love with his best friend, Theo, and his covert problems multiply when Theo moves in with a girlfriend.  David can't handle the competition for Theo's affection, and goes overboard in trying to undermine their relationship.  He decides to come out to his parents, and tell Theo of his love, on a national TV-show!  This unfortunate plan, needless to say, backfires.  David's ghastly father pronounces him sick and summarily kicks him out of the house.  His now ex-friend Theo is angry at being manipulated, and shows David just how much so by beating him with a lead pipe!  It turns out that he and his girlfriend were a perfect match afterall:  they are equally unpleasant.  They walk off into the sunset together, but not before they look back at poor, bleeding David with a mixture of pity and loathing.  The perfect ending for a mean-spirited film that TLA should be ashamed to have produced 
 This is supposed to be a revealing look at the superhuman community and what happens when one is killed by another.  What it actually is is a self-serving justification for the Youngblood universe and all of its little spinoffs.  Knightsabre comes home drunk on his 30th birthday.  He passes out and wakes up accused of murdering Riptide.  The story moves between the main plot and short stories of spinoffs throughout the ages.  As the story moves to an unlikely trial (held in private) we find that the whole event is a result of the entire universe.  Every character since the dawn of time has had some hand in this story.  This story was supposed to show how a superhero faces trial using non-super courts and legal systems.  But they pick their own judge and hold the trial in secret.  Secret from the non-super world, that is.  In the end it just shows how cleverly Alan Moore can tie seemingly unrelated elements into a story.  The story ends with the third part of the four-part story.  Part four is reserved for a series of short Youngblood prequel stories (why not just make it a three-parter?).  If you want to see Moore being clever, you might like this one.  If you are looking for the advertised drama, stay away because it isn't here 
 "Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I didn't realize that this movie is basically all in German with english subtitles. Second, it is mostly about Erik Zabel. Yes, the scenary is nice and the music is good, but I wouldn't buy it again nor would i watch it again. 
 This book has at least 10 authors and is fun to read for the first few chapters. Then I really got annoyed to read the same things over and over again and at the same time I missed some more in depth explanations. A lot is done with the framework itself. This is probably due to the very early delivery date of the book. Though I really enjoyed the C# example (game of life) I think you be better served with Hollis, Lhotka "VB.Net Programming". Also there seem to be quite a few other books out by now 
 I've got most of their other CDs. I held off on this one due to the bad reviews and they were right. I can't recommend this one at all. Muddy sound, lousy lyrics, no hooks, nothing 
 This review is being written by a patient of Whitaker Wellnes Institute, a subscriber, and a customer. Dr. Whitaker has revised most of his books except for this one.  After Tens in print this book is ready for Revision and Expansion.  Buy it used if you must have a copy.  Then wait for the revision

 I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory.  So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE!  Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products 
 I received the Lacrosse weather station as a gift. It started out working ok for about 4 weeks. Plagued by software and communication problems I do not recomend it to anyone. The tecnical support team is of little or no help.It all goes back to that old saying,you get what you pay for. A Very Dissatisified Customer. 
 This book didn't ring my chimes.... the examples were not fully explained and there seemed to be gaps in the theory. Big thumbs down 
 This book is based on on the opinion of the author and a few male "experts".  He bases his observations about women on his survey of a small group of church women who appear to represent the traditional role of the submissive stay at home wife and mother.  He never gives any other background of who these women are.  Dobson needs to wake up and realize that the traditional role of stay at home housewife is "history", even if the wife has chosen to stay at home and care for children.  Unless you are married with "traditional" roles you will likely be turned off by this book. I was. Some of Dobson's references in this book are so weak, as he seeks to show how men and women are so different from each other.  I believe that he has joined in the destuctive practice of seeking to look for how men and women are different rather than looking at our mutual needs like respect, emotional support, communication and loyalty. I gave this book one star because there are some parts that are interesting, it's just a shame that Dobson put this book out with the title it has.  Women and men should read this book with a very critical mind, if at all 
 This is a filmography, not a biography. This book focuses almost entirely on Kurosawa's and Mifune's films, giving almost no insight into what their lives were like, or what they were like as people. The first half of this 800-page book is an interminable series of synopses of their early works -- films of significance today only as harbingers of much greater things to come. (Particularly annoying is the author's endless quoting of contemporary reviews from "Variety.") The second half still focuses primarily on the films and the minutiae of their production, but provides some substance about K&M's personal lives. However, it is not nearly enough to get a clear picture of Mifune and Kurosawa as real-life people. We, the readers, always feel like fans still observing the two legends from a distance, learning almost nothing of their personal lives. For instance, barely half a page is spent on Mifune's wedding, and essentially nothing is written about his wife, Sachiko.  In addition, although this is a dual biography-the justification being that Mifune and Kurosawa did their best work together-Mr. Galbraith fails to convey what kind of relationship, whether personal or professional, the two had. Rather, the book's focus alternates from one to the other between chapters. A glaring omission in this regard is a failure to examine their famous falling out. The overly cautious author only hints that it was due to Mifune's reluctance to be tied down by the perfectionist director's lengthy shoots ("Red Beard," their last film together, took 2 years to film), that Mifune, once he gained fame, preferred quick, easy-money projects to support his luxurious lifestyle. However, almost no anecdotes are given to illustrate this or any other aspect of their relationship.    In summary, the definitive English-language biographies of Mifune and Kurosawa have yet to be written 
 This book reads like something that sat in the author's desk drawer for a few years before he decided to publish it.  The terminology for the submarine, referring to the "King" as the class ship of the Centurian series of US Navy submarines is sort of confusing.  If a ship is the 'class' ship, that is what the series is called, such as the Seawolf class or Dallas class and so on.  Another clue that this manuscript just sat there is a total lack of reference to the 9/11 attacks.  Not one word.  Seems like there would be something there, since one of the stated missions of the submarine is littoral or shallow water combat, according to the book.  All that aside, I was disappointed with the characters, particularly the stupidity of the American sailors when presented with an imposter on their submarine.  I just don't buy the fact that no one notices all the mistakes.  No one notices that a supposedly well trained officer doesn't know anything about American submarines and how they operate.  That asks too much in the suspension of disbelief department.  I won't give away the ending, suffice to say that it was a huge disappointment heaped on top of a pile of others.  Buy this one at your own risk.  If you want thrillers that are accurate, best stick to the authors that do their research, and have actually set foot on board a submarine 
 I value the Amazon Product Reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback.  I purchased this phone from Home Depot for $69.95.  I am returning it today.  It is to large for comfort, the reception is bad, the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses... I could go on 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 1. no attachment-so, you can clean a 1 inch circle at once (how convenient is that?) 2. It is heavy and smooth and cone shape!  This does not make for a comfortable, secure grip (the other kinds a toddler could use)  I don't get the good reviews!!!!!!!!   good for ... cracks in car seat 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Forget Summers, Father Satan has already dealt with him and all those hypocritical fools who thought they could play around with the demons, hold them in chains, and embarrass them. The demons are free now and anyone who wants to follow Montague Summers can join him in Satan's personal chamber of torment. That is his price to pay for agreeing with all those witchburnings, hahaha. I'm glad he's dead. May he suffer in Hell 
 Agree w/ a prior reviewer - this book was VERY disappointing.  I was horrified to hear it read, for the first time, by a 'teacher' (who obligingly filled in the dialogue for the non-mouse animals, to say to the mouse: "No I don't want to be your friend. . .  your too little (or whatever)."   I think it can be read w/ a more positive spin, e.g., "I'd love to be your friend, but I can't play right now. . . "  But the illustrations really convey a negative message to kids, and on its face is about being friends w/ your own kind, since it's only the mouse at the end who says "Yes."  Not what I want to teach to my children.  This book apparently was written in the 70's.  It's way out of date, and I wouldn't buy it.  Other Carle books have the same type of animal illustrations, so it's nothing special in that regard either.  
 The Finale Primer is a waste. If you purchased Finale 98, the book that comes with it is nearly identical, so I now have virtually the same book twice. Also, it is very poorly indexed and cross-referenced, resulting in  much frustration as I try to find assistance on various topics. You are  much better off saving your money and using the original manual and HELP  screens 
 It's pretty and colorful and has more sidebars than text.  It starts with a ten page "why this book is great" embedded review and continues making it pretty throughout the book.  But there is no content.  The basic form of the book is to define a few terms, define a chart, have some barely related case study, go to the next chapter.  It's an easy book to teach from, but a horrible book to learn from.  For example, it brings up the four P's (Place, Promotion, Price, Product) with a paragraph or two for each.  It completely misses the idea that place might have changed from this new Internet thing.  Another book might mention how a major online retailer might immediately give you 25% ACD (All Commodity Distribution %) or discuss the importance of WalMart and mass retailers.  This book just blithy continues on, secure in the knowledge that you know the definition for the test.  The whole book is written as if you purchased a set of flashcards 
 The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful.  It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated.  Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices.  It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book 
 Two previous reviews, "World-class hype - ordinary book", and "Good Concept, Amatuerish Writing" sum up the situation well.  None of the characters are complete, and we learn nothing of the character's "internals".  They simply move about, do things, and talk to each other while the author blandly describes their surroundings.  The book reads like a screenplay (and perhaps that's what it is).  There's not much I can add to those two reviews, but I wanted to add one more cautioning voice against the numerous blurbs within the book and those found here.  There's a caveat: I bailed after just under two hundred pages and I suppose it's possible that this thing turns into a real marvel at some point beyond that, but I don't see how.  I will say that any comparison to Neal Stephenson, however, is just ridiculous.  "Snow Crash" eats this thing's lunch without breaking a sweat.    
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 I first heard of The Buddha in the world durring an interview of the author Pankaj Mishra on NPR.  His interview was fascinating discussing what I felt was a subject that could use a freash approach. I picked up the book soon thereafter and tried to get into it.  The subject interests me very much but mr Mishra never engaged me. His personal stories and his dry historical accounts were forced.  It almost seemed like this was writen as one would a pre-graduate college paper on an assighned subject with mounds of reference books close by. the book has but little continueity or flow. I was dissapointed, but maybe my expectations were too high.  Even as a history book I would look elsewhere 
 I have a slightly older copy and I have found that for the PE exam this is a good reference however, if you are doing something in the real world, the Machinery's Handbook is FAR better.  This book gives good overviews of a huge variety of topics that any Mech Engr might need but not much depth.  It is about as much information as a manager might want to know 
 This guy is worse than the guy that wrote "million little pieces". PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I read it at the book store, because I don't want Amber to have a dime of my money. She isn't worth it. I followed this case slowly at the beginning, but then kinda lost interest in it. I did learn things that I had not heard heard in the media, and we did get tidbids of Amber's *somewhat* juicy encounters with Scott. I think Amber is pretty pathetic to be honest with you, she saw a million red flags, and decided to ignore them. She also has conflicting information her here and there. There are about 10 pages in the book where she talks about her life, which is very boring. To be honest, if read Jenna Jameson's autobiography, you will find similarities. To be honest, I'm surprised Amber didn't land up making adult films.(If you read Jenna's book you would understand) Amber portrays herself her herself as a hero, and she she thinks America feels the same way. The book itself is around 210 pages, there are about 10 pages of pics. 10 pages of dialog between her and Scott. 10 pages of uninteresting info about her personal life. And probably 60-70 of info we already new, if you followed the case somewhat closely. So that leaves about 100 pages. I think the book retails for $25.95, save your money. Look forward to a FOX special between her and Tonya Harding in Celebrity boxing 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 If it were possible, I would give a negative star rating for this book.  To sum it all up in one sentence, Carol (an extreme left-wing animal rights/environmentalist/Feminazi propagandist and a New Age crystal-squeezer to boot) actually claims that eating meat is equivalent and related to abusing women!  I can just see the eco-cops outside my kitchen window with guns drawn "SIR, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE CHEESEBURGER!!".  Never once in her book does she consider the obvious fact that meat has always been a normal part of the human diet in the vast majority of cultures, and that maybe, just maybe, people (including women) eat meat simply because it tastes good.  But then it's typical for the more extreme feminists to be so out of touch with reality that they see nefarious male-oriented political motivations in even the most innocent of human behavior 
 I am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  There was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.  I read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group. 
 The ending to a horror movie can make or break it & just like 'I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER''URBAN LEGENDS' & many more flops since Wes Craven's original & excellent slasher parody 'SCREAM' Craven's follow up 'SCREAM 2' is ridiculously broken by its ultra lame ending. It was a decent slasher flick most of the way through & then destroid by its ending! I truly believe that this is one of the movies that marks the beginning of Wes Craven falling off the great horror director wagon! I mean come on look at his most recent flops 'RED EYE' & the absolute intolerable 'CURSED'. What happend Wes!  
 I was eagerly awaiting this release for a few reasons, the main one being that I was anxious to get Edith Massey's "Big Girls Don't Cry" on cd.  Imagine my horror when I queued that track up and realized that that track was mastered from vinyl that's very scratched and not even balanced properly between the channels.  It's either fake stereo or mono with the channel balance off.  Did John Waters (or whoever put the sources together for him) not have a copy of the Rhino "World's Worst Records" album?  If they couldn't find a master tape for this song, at least taking it from the Rhino compilation would have resulted in a reasonable mix.  Some other tracks sound similarly bad for no reason.  Ray Charles' "The Right Time" has been issued on countless cds from master tape but on this cd it's taken from a VERY scratchy 45 rpm record.  Why?  I'm not actually sure that ANY of the songs on this cd were taken from tape, though the scratches are at a minimum on several of the songs.  It seems that someone just sat down with their record collection and transferred a bunch of records to a computer to burn a cd compilation.  I can do that level of quality at home.  Quite honestly I intend to "fix" this compilation for myself by replacing a "needle drop" that I had already done of Edith Massey's track for the one here, replacing the Ray Charles track with a copy ripped from another cd, and perhaps replacing some other tracks (I haven't analyzed the disc enough yet) then then reburning my own compilation.  Then this disc will go back to a used cd store.  I am a HUGE John Waters fan and even waited in line to buy his Christmas compilation cd and get his autograph.  That cd was well done.  This cd is junk.  Shame on John Waters for allowing his name and face to be connected to such a low quality product.  (Yes, I know that his early films featured unlicensed music snippets taken from scratchy records, but that was over 30 years ago when he was poor. 
 As one reviewer so eloquently pointed out, Anne Marie Oliver and Paul Steinberg show a complete disregard for political and social factors in their extremely superficial and biased analysis of suicide terrorism. In order to describe the true motives behind suicide attacks, one must look into the root causes of suicide terrorism. Contrary to popular belief, a typical suicide bomber is not a religious zealot seeking to destroy the West because he abhors our liberal values. In point of fact, most suicide bombers are secular individuals, as corroborated by the fact that the group responsible for most suicide attacks in the world the Tamil Tigers are adamantly opposed to religion. Admittedly, religion is often used as a tool to recruit new suicide bombers by promising them eternal life in paradise. Nonetheless, religion is by no means a primary motive behind suicide terrorism. While its importance should not be downplayed or denied, it only plays a secondary role.   Robert Pape has in my opinion conducted the most meticulous and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism. What makes Pape's study so superior to every other book on suicide terrorism is that it refuses to make simplistic and unsubstantiated claims. It delves deep into the root causes of suicide terrorism and is not afraid to ask the dangerous questions. Pape's study demonstrates without a doubt that most suicide bombers are driven primarily by political motives. According to Pape, the principal motive of suicide bombers is to obliterate the presence of foreign powers from the areas that suicide bombers consider to be their homelands. Therefore, simply labeling a Palestinian suicide bomber as a religious fanatic driven solely by religious motives is a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification. Most Palestinian suicide bombers have divulged that their primary motive is to fight the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and to relieve the suffering of their people. They believe that the only way to fight a much more powerful adversary is to resort to suicide missions. In the view of the Palestinian suicide bombers all targets are legitimate since they are at war with Israel. They also believe that they have the right to retaliate against the Israeli killing of the Palestinian children and women which Israel by the way conveniently labels as the "collateral damage".   Understanding suicide terrorism does not suggest in any way that it is morally justifiable. But if we really wish to understand its root causes then we must tell the truth and refrain from making sensationalistic albeit incorrect and misleading conclusions. People who live under the Israeli occupation are subjected daily to humiliation and derogatory comments. They live in abject poverty where desperation, despair and hopelessness are omnipresent. It is out of these gruesome conditions that suicide terrorism emerges. Imagine being humiliated and mistreated every day in your own country by an extremely powerful bully. What would you do?   All these factors are somehow overlooked or at best downplayed in this book. Subsequently, the conclusions are erroneous, inaccurate and biased. I recommend Robert Pape's brilliant book Dying to Win The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism and John Esposito's Unholy War Terror in the Name of Islam. In addition to these books, I recommend an extremely powerful and disturbing movie Paradise Now.     
 I just didn't like this book.  I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET.  Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them.  The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.  Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanity  Con- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.  It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it 
 Don't get me wrong... I do like d&b remixes and I love the art of  noise but this album is more noise then art.  When musicians rely on drum  machines to make their music sound 'cool' this is what happens.  There are  a couple of exceptions on this album such as opus4 & peter gunn which  must have taken effort and talent to create.  However for the bulk of the  rest of this album.... pllease! 
 If you believe Britain made what Africa is today than this is the book for you. Pakenham portrays the scramble for Africa as a two-player game between Britain and France, with little attention being paid to the portuguese, german, italian or spanish presence and interests in the continent. As a result, Pakenham's book is really a book about the British scramble for Africa, neglecting some of the most curious cultural and political aspects of the heterogeneous european presence in Africa. Focused in Britain, Pakenham also misses the opportunity to explore the reaction of african cultures to colonial advances and the position of independent african states. It is therefore a rather poor book and one in which prejudice against other european colonial powers is too often evident 
 After a very disappointing viewing of Harry's Only You Concert DVD, I got smart and borrowed Only You CD from the library. I'd hoped that concert was just one off. How sad, this CD is no better than that wretched concert. Slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish. And what happened to Harry's voice and phrasing? God, unbearable. When Harry Met Sally, Come by Me, what happened to you, Harry 
 I came to this page struggling with how to encapsulate my take on 'Dying Gaul,' but I see that amazon reviewer Josh Lanyon has nailed it perfectly:  "The actors were brilliant and the thing is so beautifully shot--the music, mood, the little touches--all great. And all rather beside the point."  Exactly.  Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard are all spectacular here.  I thought Scott was the standout.  And, the movie looks incredible.  But the dark mood of the movie got darker and darker...and simply less likable.  By the end, you won't care for any of the three protagonists.  I watched the movie with two other people.  None of us liked the ending...nor did it matter by that point.  We just wanted it to end.  We were intrigued by the presence of an 'alternate ending' on the DVD.  It's basically the same ending, but it goes on a bit longer and only confirms that the ambiguity of the released ending was intended (one character expresses the ambiguity in a voice over) 
 This book is very hard to read. It is also inaccurate and hard to follow. I want to get a refund on this book 
 Very nicely photographed and detailed illustrations.  However, doesn't give a lot of hints or guidelines to creating the same effects in your own spaces.  But overall, a very nice reference book for ideas and inspirations.  Would have loved it with actual floor plans of the rooms shown 
 This book has everything to do with cheating your money out of your pocket in whatever way the "master" can manage. It has nothing to do with actual financial market investing/trading. Beware of "master" of DECEIT!!!!!!  Give it a minus 100 stars. 
 This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it 
 Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.  
 I already wrote a review of this one that Amazon dot com must have lost or something because it did not show up after even like 5 days.  That does not surprise me for reasons I will explain in a minute but first you came here to see a review of the book and so here you go and then I will get back to my earlier point.  This book is about a fireman in the future only in the future there is no longer any fire at all so instead of putting out fires he lights books on fire but he does not like to make fires so then he quits being a fireman.  I swear thats what the book is about and I know it makes no sense I didnt understand it either.  Why is he a fireman?  I DONT KNOW!  NOBODY KNOWS!  But the real problems started when I returned this book to my local library and now they say I did not return it at all even though I did and it was in a pile of other books which! I returned all at the same time together so I know.  But now they say I owe the library $7 for a new book even though it was used.  Whatever.  My advice: this book is cursed or something because everything about it gets lost even a review OF THE BOOK THAT I ALREADY WROTE. I am going to go back to the library next week and I bet its back on the shelf laughing at me with my $7 in its hand.  I hate this book but to be fair it rates TWO STARS because I guess it is okay if you like stories about firemen which I do 
 I just revied on the "Popstar" page, so I was inspired to go here too. I really feel like the minority here. But this was what I thought of the movie. Please not that I and NOT a Chris Trousdale fan, in fact, to tell you the truth, I really can't stand him. But, enough about me, let's get on to the review.  Let's start out with the obvious, the quality was horrible. It was sickeningly grainy. Honestly, it could have easily been filmed with one of my home video cameras. If I remeber right, the sound was bad too, but that could just be my imagination.  Lemme tell ya, Chris is not a born actor,I'm sorry, but he's not. But there's good in everything, right. This movie is no exeption. The only good I found in this movie was Garfield, the lead girls older brother. Oh yeah, and I think there was an old wise man in there somewhere too. That's about it. YOu know that kind of movie, that makes you kind of sick, disgusted, and feel like you have wasted one and a'half hours of your life. This is that movie.  Now you may be asking yourself, "If you dont like Chris AT ALL, why on earth did you watch the movie" I thought it would be hilariously bad okay.  YOU wanted my opinion, you got it  
 I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.  Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.  If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms 
 More like a diary of some of Tom's successes (and he has had many) but only a few anecdotes.  Buy one of TJ Cloutier's books (or Slansky's) for much much more insight 
 I must have a funny bone missing or something. This trite little book was a big yawn from start to finish. The only thing I can say in its favour is that, living and working in France as I do, it will be a little easier to explain some of the peculiarities of the English language to the natives 
 If you are like me you like a book that really gets you into it no matter where you are in the book. In other words if you are interested in the material at lesson nine that is where you start. Well this book doesn't even come close to doing that. I am an advanced computer user and pick up things easily. This book forces you to creep your way slowly through the lessons. Forget about looking up how to do a specific task. You may find this book usefull if you are an absolute beginner to the computer software interface. Otherwise I suggest you get something a little more advanced 
 The very concept of this book is deeply offensive to anyone who values freedom of speech and thought, or good writing.  Don't these people realize that they are engaging in intentional brainwashing?  You can't change reality by changing the words; you have to change it by changing the reality.  Resist these intellectual totalitarians at every opportunity!  Use (and treasure) precise, vigorous language, eschew emasculated, politically correct twaddle 
 Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?   The "sculpting stick" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.   Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 I bought this book not knowing what I was getting myself into. I wanted to throw this book away. Maybe it just wasn't my type of book, but it just was NOT enjoyable to me. Some of the descriptions went on FOREVER when the author was describing something that could've been done in one or two words in my opinion.   Don't get me wrong, there were some enjoyable moments in the book, but overall, I was thoroughly UNimpressed. I think what drew me to the book was the title. I also was going to get one of his other books, but decided to try one, then see how it goes from there.  Now I'm skeptical about trying another one.  It took me forever to get through this book, and I was not satisfied at all 
 The player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help. Overall I would not advise this ite 
 I had high hopes when I bought this book. After all, I fly Southwest whenever possible, because it's the most efficient, well-run airline with top notch employees. Although this book covers that ground, it does so in a hype-filled, "Kellner is great, Kellner is good, let us thank Kellner for our flight, amen" style sure to turn intelligent readers off.  Nobody's perfect. What were the mistakes? What could Southwest have done differently? When the book is nothing but accolades, you begin to wonder if it's all true or not.  I still love the airline, but this book was a waste 
 I love dragons, and I love dragon movies, I also like B grade movies, but this one is bad. The acting was woeful, I mean really really bad, the story was ok.  I tried and tried to like this movie, but I just couldn't.  It might of been because of lack of money, but the same shot of the dragon over and over, flipped and played again was a bit much.  The over use of multiple split-screen shots got a bit annoying, they work well when done right, but in this move they where done all wrong.  If I where you I would stay clear of this one, but then again watching this will make other bad movies better.... 
 We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift.  What a nightmare.  First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better.  This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it.  It cuts NOTHING.  This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch.  There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together.  We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking!  The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING.  My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic. 
 Don't waste your time. Find something else... I can't believe I watched this movie..good think I didn't buy it...I borrowed it from the library...lol.. 
 This has to be pretty much the most worthless book I've ever encountered. It details a vast "conspiracy" against the American people on the part of every reputable scientist who has ever walked on this earth (as vs. Dr. Carter's tame circle of quacks, who are of course perfect in Dr. Carter's estimation despite the fact that their so-called "studies" violate every principle of double-blind controlled research). If you are an adherent of wishy-washy new age "therapies" or you believe that the U.S. government is covering up the "fact" that UFO's are visiting our planet, you'll love this book. If you know a single bit of science, buy this book only for the comic effect 
 Gardners' has long been regarded as the rather stuffy "bible" of art history texts, mainly because of its commercial longevity (it's been around since the 1930s). Recent editions have suffered under recent editorship. The addition of tiresome "clever" subtitles, coupled with the creeping-in of a new shallower "touchy-feelie" approach to the exegesis of the artworks--no doubt intended to perk-up this withering old warhorse--are sad things to behold. Readers are well-advised to select instead the far superior ART HISTORY by MARILYN STOKSTAD. It is everything Gardners' used to be...and more 
 Dr. Archer is well-schooled. He has a law degree, and extensive training as a linguist. Many of the points he makes in this volume would have been more influential if he had only chosen to annotate the text. He presents  numerous ideas about so-called bible difficulties that are not mentioned in  commentaries by other authors. Due to the complete absence of footnotes or  other annotation, it is nearly impossible to determine what ideas were the  product of research and which are opinion. A work of this type should  provide the reader with the opportunity to pursue the sources of origen in  order to evaluate the author's points against the points of others in the  same field 
 The book does not depict enough information about computers in todays changing world. For the Price of the book, It is most likely a regret. But the basic and indepth ideas are worth every penny 
 As with other books edited or affiliated with Jean Smith, there seems to be confusion as to how many days there are in the year.  This book says there's 365, while another of Smith's collections about Buddhism says there's 366.  In fact, both books only have 356 entries.  This type of glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of depth and detailed consideration given to the content of this book.  I would look elsewhere for "wisdom" if I were you.  I wasted another fifteen bucks on this one 
 The people on this review are crazy. This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was ridiculously stupid, and I hated it. It was assigned to me by my AP European History teacher for summer work, but I despised it. I tend to like books teachers require you to read, like the other book she required--All Quiet on the Western Front. I absolutely loved it.   Read this if: you like long-winded explanations about anything (She definitely gives you extremely detailed accounts on everything that is not important at all to the War.)  you like conversations in non-fiction books (How did that happen? I didn't realize people transcribed informal conversations between generals)...  you already know military tactics and are well-versed in European history...otherwise, you may be confused during many important parts of the book  you like war and don't care about the human suffering involved; Tuchman is heartless in her analysis--she barely describes any of the human stories of war  you enjoy being bored--you WILL be bored half the time  you desire only to learn about the first month of the war...   I HATED this book; I don't understand any of the comments thus far. This book was horrible; don't waste your time reading it. Learn about WWI somewhere else. I know there are better non-fiction about this conflict than this piece of toilet paper 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 This book should have been titled "How I Got My First Job At 26 And Then Started Planning For My Retirement" It's a book about how Asha Tyson expanded her awareness. It's full of inspirational zingers gleaned form other writers but she never get's to the 'how to'. Here is her definition of retirement "Retirement is taking on the responsibility as a brilliant life form to make a contribution with your gifts."  What??? She also says that anyone can do what she has done but then says,"By age nine, I was narrating plays and giving keynote addresses at banquet halls for award and appreciation ceremonies." Also, "...I'd always had charisma,drive, and stamina..."  Sounds like a GIFTED person to me! Hey folks, save your money, Think and Grow Rich is still a great read 
 Very surprised at the ratings on this book. I thought it was very poorly written and really boring. Actually, just the first 100 pages were boring, I gave up after that. 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 This book is incoherent.  I read plenty of Sci-fi saw some of the rave reviews and thought I would try this novel.  What a mistake- I could not get past the first 30 pages.  After that I just flipped through the pages without reading them to see, in vain, if something would grab me.  I could not understand what was going on, or what this book was about.  I dont understand how someone could write so incoherently.  A possible explanation is that some of the reviews mention that this book was originally separate stories.   I think the author has a great imagination, is creative and has innovative concepts with respect to cyber technology.  However, none of that resulted I a novel that I could comprehend. 
  I just reviewed the samples and see it's performed by Walter Chancelor jr. he's ok. but the music is watered down just like his tribute to Earth, Wind & Fire and what's misleading is it says various artists so you'd expect some of the top sax players in smooth jazz, but it's just him and a handful of musicians on other instruments.  So if you want a good smooth jazz tribute to Luther then purchase  Forever, For Always For Luther at least they actually have various artists performing, but this album NOT!!!!! and I really mean NOT!!!! 
 Great recording, but if you want to actually use it, like load it on your ipod it has sony's stupid DRM. Meaning you can't. DON'T BUY SONY PRODUCTS!! 
 Save your money and invest in other self-help book that is much easier to relate. The author seems to paint a very grimm picture of human relation. Many parts of this book writting were very confusing. I could not help but think book was written as an outlet therapy journal for author herself. There are much better self-help books out there in the market. Check this book out at your local library before investing your money on buying one 
 The guy below is right.  The blades are so far down it won't cut anything but really long hairs.  How could this make it through any product test?  I tossed mine in the garbage. 
 My 1 year old son loves the Little Einsteins show, so I bought him this book.  I am sorely disappointed with the book, and my son doesn't care for it.  It's a complete ripoff from the Farmer Annie's Garden episode, and doesn't add anything to it.  There is only one lift flap per page.  The book could use more substance 
 I applaud Linda's choice to make a difficult cross-over and bring mainstream attention to the genre.  However, now that her marketing dollars got your attention, you have the opportunity to buy a better product.  Linda is a fine singer, but if we compare her to others who spent their entire careers in this genre then she falls short.  Her voice is monotonous...she only has one color and one technique (open with lots of vibrato) & her phrasing is quite poor (in Spanish).  Do yourself a favor and buy Lola Beltran, Amalia Mendoza or Hermanas Padilla instead.  Further, she cannot even claim to be the best Chicana in the genre...that honor would belong to Alicia Juarez the last wife of Jose Alfredo Jimenez 
 I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'.  This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING.  It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day.  I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE!  I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day.  It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!  Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv.  Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale.  Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO 
 I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her! 
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 'Why I'm Not a Catholic but Still Insist I Am" would be a much better title. For somebody who claims to know so much about the Catholic faith (and disagree with so many of the Church's teachings), it's truly laughable for him to write a book in which he claims to be a Catholic 
 When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo 
 The problem with this CD is that the music for fife and drum is not played with fifes; it's played with PICCOLOS. If you're a fife lover like me you'll be disappointed. Maybe the musicians on this ensemble weren't skillful enough to play the fife and resorted to the piccolo, which has keys and therefore is much easier to play. And the bugle calls are actually trumpet calls 
 I thought Fred Saberhagen's "Berserker Fury" (1997) was redundant.  But while Syd Field's "Screenplay" offers plenty of reassurance to the wanna-be screenwriter, pretty soon I got the point and was tired of all the cheerleading.  Field may indeed have something substantial to say, but I couldn't help wondering if this book started out as photocopied handouts (since Field apparently taught at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College) and ended up as a hardbound book.  That led me to question if the revisions to the successive editions of the book (1979, 1982, 1994) didn't simply consist of inserting additional redundancies.  If you can stand to wade through (and/or "weed through") the pep talk, you might actually get something out of this book.  I couldn't, so I didn't.    That means it's time to drag out J. Michael ("Babylon 5," "Murder, She Wrote") Straczynski's "The Complete Book of Scripwriting" (subtitled "The all-in-one guide to writing and selling screenplays, teleplays, theatrical plays, radio scripts and animation scripts").  
 Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells 
 I have read almost all of David Hawkins books and now wonder about his credability.  In this book his calibrations of politics, political leaders and current topics are all aligned with the conservative fundamentalists.   Up to this point I had believed Hawkins to be an objective and brilliant researcher and scientist but now I have my doubts?   One example of his bias is George Bush  (Any student of public speaking can readily identify speakers who lie or deceive).  Applied Kinesiology would indeed be a wonderful tool if you could also calibrate the user of it! LH 
 Reason To Believe has got to be the worst movie I have ever sat through. Non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting. I am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay. There really is no reason to see this movie. Totally disgusting. Why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension!!! 
 can comment on DVD - have been writing to ESPN to get a "best commercial" volume out for years - many great ESPN commercials missing - such as "Electric football" commercials and "Sports Center the cartoon" commercials - ESPN has a great opportunity to make some money on a comprehensive DVD of the commercials but fails to do so.. 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 Native Tongue  by Carl Hiaasen   This book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  No doubt, it is a page-turner.  And it is better than the other book of Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy.  But all that does not a good read make...  A strength of Hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  Most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck Florida "crackers".  Hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  And we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  Etc. etc.  So what's wrong.  Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of TV-sitcom-gone-book.  It achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  One might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment?  If you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany "fun", Native Tongue might satisfy.    I have one additional problem with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have with Michael Crichton.  These books stink of hypocrisy.  Crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  Hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness.   While I enjoyed a few sections of Native Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours that should have been better spent 
 BUYER BEWARE!!!! I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas.  On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt.  I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd.  I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December.  The billing however has yet to be straighted out.  My credit card has yet to be credited, I do not have the product, and no one returns calls or emails.  BUYER BEWARE!!! 
 I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it.  Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details.  For instance, what kind of population is this really?  There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book.  I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a "jungle" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families.  Also, are most of these students from single-parent households?  And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?  Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much 
 This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course. When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! 
 This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar "tales." It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft.  Where was the editor 
 This book is not written for those of us that have been overindulging for years.  It is written for the folk that are on the verge of becomming an alcoholic.  "You must still be in the early stages of problem drinking" "You've engaged in problem drinking for 5 years or less"  It is stated numberous times in the first few chapters that the program is not for problem drinkers.  She goes on to define the alcoholic, and state again that her program is not for YOU!  I want my money back 
 i couldn't wait to get this. but then when I started reading it, i just got so fustrated with it. i mean, it was such crap...what they were saying. they got everything completely wrong. at the end of the book, i was so pissed off, that i started to just write down why hate their stupid little debates they propose. this book is a disgrace to the wachowski brothers and just the matrix phenomenon in general.   
 This book is more geared towards the beginner, though even beginners need to have basic meanings to base their ideas on which this book fails to deliver. In its chapters it refers to reading material to research ie other books on the subject that pertain to the chapters teachings.    The whole point of buying this book is so you dont have to buy any others otherwise you would have bought them instead!  This book promises so much and delivers very little!  A very disapointing book, better introductory and advanced books are available! 
 This book is far from being either a thorough or balanced biography of Bruno. When its not digressing into the author's sweeping and judgmental generalizations about history - "For such people, everyday life was an agony and the society in which they lived was almost stagnant...all but a few... spent most of their time inebriated" - and his demonization of Christianity, it focuses only on Bruno's arrest and trial and covers only in bad summary or not at all the rest of his life. White rips on Catholicism and Protestantism beyond the facts, yet depicts Renaissance intellectuals anticipating a supposedly true faith of modern scientific theories and method as humanity's salvation. What few and poor citations and footnotes are provided - "Christian doctrine does not evolve; it is based upon cast-in-stone tenets and therefore cannot develop or offer anything radical or original." - are too little to justify the sweeping judgments, and leave one confused as to whether the Hollywood style dialogues between Bruno and his confessor are actual quotes or White's embelishments.   Its no secret that the churches and governments of Europe abused their power severely during the last 1900 years. A lot of the bleakness of situation that White describes is true. But he goes beyond history to paint a black and white picture of a purely evil church and intellectuals martyred for their belief in scientific methods and theories that DIDN'T YET EXIST. The complexity of the historical situation and the intelectual relationships between the Christian clergy and scholars is glazed over; the motives and reasons for the atmosphere of suppresion are chalked off solely to the evil ignorance and greed of every single person of power in the church. The complexity of the crossover identities of European Christian scholars and their struggle to reconcile their faith and observations goes out the window - White has Bruno convenienently seeing the good in everything mainstream science currently cheers, and totally condemning everything it currently despises. His treatment of Bruno's interests is completely anachronistic and belays all the tenets he held to that scientists would balk at, and vice versa.  This book isn't about Bruno's views - its about White's. Like a bad Hollywood movie set against a historical backdrop, this is more about what's going on now then what happened back then 
 Actually, I have to say this is not something worth buying, even if you are a die-hard fan, which I can say without any doubt in my mind, I am. proof? i have drumsticks and picks from countless shows, shirts, cds, posters etc signed by all the ladies, and of course every ladies room cd and ep/demo/yellow tape/itunes recording they have ever put out... and i was truly dissapointed by this DVD, it is advertized as a live show with interviews, and that part is fine, but the only extra feature is you get to watch the interview uncut... no 'maroon foot cream' or DVD-rom features. if you know someone that has it, watch it so that you can say you have seen it. But I wouldn't recomend spending more than five dollars on this BNL item 
 Simply put, this movie shames the Dragonball Z genre.   This movie has a very poor plot, uninspiring music, lacks drama or emotion, and could be entertaining to only the youngest of children at best.  Avoid this film and, perhaps, send a message to funimation to stop putting out garbage.  
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 This year, 60% of college entries will be female.  Look at this spring's honor role listings.  Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female.  Schools are fails boys - not girls.  If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book.  If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this 
 Prof Mihesuah has a lot to say about other people's ethics but sees fit to write a 5-star review of her own book using the space provided for reader reviews, even though there is a separate area provided for authors to make their own comments.  As a published author myself, I wouldn't dream of doing this.  It's completely unethical and undermines any valid arguments she puts forward in her book 
 Though I have only become acquainted with the Lovecraft universe/Cthulhu Mythos in the past year, and though I was greatly looking forward to delving into this collection when I discovered it, I really feel that this particular collection falls short.  Devotees to the mythos that enjoy any story with any mention of the Lovecraftian place-names, characters, or phenomena will no doubt enjoy this volume for trivia-compiling purposes, but I found the stories within to be mediocre at best and occasionally downright laughable.  These stories will most likely not be enjoyable to most readers.  The few bright spots (perhaps, less dim spots) include China Mieville's "Details", though even this seems to fall rather far from the mark set by his other work.  A large portion of the others are just silly or seem to depend entirely on the final single-line zinger for horrific affect.    I would strongly suggest that those new to Lovecraft, and in search of more of this type of literature, seek out volumes such as "Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos" or any of the fine works by Thomas Ligotti.  If you are determined to read this particular collection, please do not pay more than 3 dollars for it in a used bookstore 
 Locking your parents in the basement just to work out their marrage problems what a joke! I think my parents would be so incredibly pissed off and would kill me if I ever locked em in the basement like that with no food and treating them like they are prisoners you don't do that to your family if they want a divorce and move on with their lives that's their business. You can't change people like that it just doesn't work. this use to come on all the time on HBO and HBO is a huge waste of money nothing but worthless re run crappy movies on all the time. I give this crap 0 stars it sucked 
 Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.'   The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.    Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom.   Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.    
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn something new about bandsaws.  Mind you, I have been using bandsaws for years, but this book told me absolutely NOTHING new.  A good book on bandsaws would include other uses for the saws than just cutting wood and such.  For instance, in my years of using bandsaws I have found that bandsaws are good for cutting large pieces of meat, even frozen (except sometimes it breaks the bandsaw and once I hurt myself quite badly).  No mention of that in the book!  Bandsaw blades make excellent plates at "MANLY" dinner parties (again, one injury once) but NO mention of the book.  Plus the book fails to mention any novel bandsaw techniques, even for wood.  No mention of the "zen fruit" technique a lot of builders are using now, and scarcely a nod to the "all thumbs" method pioneered by sweedish bandsaw enthusiasts 
 This book should only be read by the most novice of aspiring sound personele, at best. Some areas are terribly missleading and, at times, will leave out profound information that will simply get you in trouble. The saying, "I know just enough to be dangerous" is just the feeling I get from this book. It will leave the reader with a false self confidence of professional audio that, when given the opportunity, may land them in over thier heads or achieving undesirable results. For a quality start, check out Yamaha's Sound Reinforcement book 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 Actually, it wasn't that bad of a show . . . but trying to pretend its CHRISTY makes it look fake. If the same Dr. MacNeil had NOT played in it, and if all the names had been changed, it might hold some merit of its own. It was very interesting, the way they seemed to take the type of senarios that were in the CBS series and incorperate them into this show, only with a slightly different slant (i.e. trying to help Zacheriah Holt into college, as was already done with Rob Allen; breaking up school yard sqabbles started by Lundy Taylor; begging Dr. MacNeil for help in tutoring, etc; etc.). However, all of those things only serve to accenuate how UN original and copy-cattish this show is. And Kellie Martin is, in my opinion, the only woman who can play for Christy. Also, the guy they picked for David tended to walk around with a grin painted on his face, while "SMILEY" Miss Alice always seemed perplexed about something. Besides that, the lines were poorly written, and Dr. MacNeil's casual flake with some woman from the land beyond was totally out of charactor. P.S. Lest anyone should think I'm just a grouch who loves throwing around critisism, read my other reveiws 
 There are really two, very parallel, stories told in this book, and they are only separated by a couple of million years. In the present, a young teenager named Vinny has convinced her mother to let her spend summer vacation with her father in Africa. Her father, Sam, is working in an archeological site in Africa without much success. Vinny turns out to be his good luck charm. Flip back to the past and we see a teenager called Li that is half-ape, half-human that thinks way beyond her time. Each chapter goes back and forth between past and present. A couple of times I was lost in the paleontology talk and the present storyline was a bit boring, but I liked the author's way of describing the past storyline 
 I'm having difficulty understanding all of the hype about this novel.  The writing style is not engaging.  The main character is not credible.  Even though he makes his living as a thief-taker, basically a free lance bounty hunter for the city of London, he naively throws guineas and shillings at any suspect rogue who requests money.  This, even though he was supposedly just scraping by, financially.  I read just over 300 pages, then gave up 
 I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them.  This isn't one of those cases.  I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced.  I bought this book with lots of anticipation.  I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents.  After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book.  Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts.  I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation.  Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR.  Those would be "The Jesus I Never Knew" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and "Disappointment with God" (Which also was spectacular).  If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's.  As for "Reaching the Invisible God," I wouldn't buy it 
 tried using this book to research my collection-too many errors in it to do the job-collectors should avoid-OK for some of the basics-country data not bad-better info on web/gun mag 
 The position by the author, TNH, in said book is one not doctrinally substantiated. The entire premise of this book is that is the "teachings of Gotama Buddha", when in fact it is the view/position of modern so-called Buddhism. Hanh's book posits the denial of the Atman as the basis "core of Buddhism", when in fact no such doctrinal citation exists.  The Buddhist term Anatman (Sanskrit), or Anatta (Pali) is an adjective in sutra used to refer to the nature of phenomena as being devoid of the Soul, the ontological and subjective Self (atman) which is the "light (dipam), and only refuge" [DN 2.100]. Of the 662 occurrences of the term Anatta in the Nikayas, its usage is restricted to referring to 22 nouns (forms, feelings, perception, experiences, consciousness, the eye, eye-consciousness, desires, mentation, mental formations, ear, nose, tongue, body, lusts, things unreal, etc.), all phenomenal, as being Selfless (anatta). Contrary to some popular books written outside the scope of Buddhist doctrine, there is no "Doctrine of anatta/anatman" mentioned anywhere in the sutras, rather anatta is used only to refer to impermanent things as other than the Soul, to be anatta.          Specifically in sutra, anatta is used to describe the nature of any and all composite, consubstantial, phenomenal, and temporal things, from the macrocosmic, to microcosmic, be it matter as pertains the physical body or the cosmos at large, including any and all mental machinations which are of the nature of arising and passing. Anatta in sutra is synonymous and interchangeable with the terms dukkha (suffering) and anicca (impermanent), and all three terms are often used in triplet in making a blanket statement as regards any and all phenomena. "All these aggregates are anicca, dukkha, and anatta."          Anatta refers only to the absence of the permanent soul as pertains any one of the psycho-physical (namo-rupa) attributes, or Khandhas (skandhas, aggregates). Anatta/Anatman in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Nikayas, is an adjective, (A is anatta, B is anatta, C is anatta). The commonly held belief to wit that: "Anatta means no-soul, therefore Buddhism taught that there was no soul" is a concept, which cannot be found or doctrinally substantiated by means of the Nikayas, the sutras, of Buddhism.          The Pali term and noun for "no soul" is natthatta (literally "there is not/no[nattha]+atta'[Soul]), not the term anatta, and is mentioned at Samyutta Nikaya 4.400, where when Gotama was asked if there "was no soul (natthatta)", equated this question to be equivalent to Nihilism (ucchedavada). Common throughout Buddhist sutra is the denial of psycho-physical attributes of the mere empirical self to be the Soul, or confused with same. The Buddhist paradigm as regards phenomena is "Na me so atta" (this/these are not my soul), nearly so the most common utterance of Gotama Buddha in the Nikayas, where "na me so atta" = Anatta/Anatman. In sutra, to hold the view that there is "no-Soul" (natthatta) is = to ucchedavada (SN 4.400) [Annihilationism] = natthika (nihilist).         Logically so, according to the philosophical premise of Gotama, the initiate to Buddhism who is to be "shown the way to Immortality (amata)" [MN 2.265, SN 5.9], wherein liberation of the mind (cittavimutta) is effectuated thru the expansion of wisdom and the meditative practices of sati and samadhi, must first be educated away from his former ignorance-based (avijja) materialistic proclivities in that he "saw any of these forms, feelings, or this body, to be my Self, to be that which I am by nature". Teaching the subject of anatta in sutra pertains solely to things phenomenal, which were: "subject to perpetual change; therefore unfit to declare of such things `these are mine, these are what I am, that these are my Soul'" [MN 1.232]         The one scriptural passage where Gotama is asked by a layperson what the meaning of anatta is as follows: [Samyutta Nikaya 3.196] At one time in Savatthi, the venerable Radha seated himself and asked of the Blessed Lord Buddha: "Anatta, anatta I hear said venerable. What pray tell does Anatta mean?" "Just this Radha, form is not the Soul (anatta), sensations are not the Soul (anatta), perceptions are not the Soul (anatta), assemblages are not the Soul (anatta), consciousness is not the Soul (anatta). Seeing thusly, this is the end of birth, the Brahman life has been fulfilled, what must be done has been done."         The anatta taught in the Nikayas has merely relative value; it is not an absolute one. It does not say simply that the Soul (atta, Atman) has no reality at all, but that certain things (5 aggregates), with which  the unlearned man identifies himself, are not the Soul (anatta) and that is why one should grow disgusted with them, become detached from them and be liberated. Since this kind of anatta does not negate the Soul as such, but denies Selfhood to those things that constitute the non-self (anatta), showing them thereby to be empty of any ultimate value and to be repudiated, instead of nullifying the Atman (Soul) doctrine, it in fact compliments it.         What has Buddhism to say of the Self? "That's not my Self" (na me so atta); this, and the term "non Self-ishness" (anatta) predicated of the world and all "things" (sabbe dhamma anatta; Identical with the Brahmanical "of those who are mortal, there is no Self/Soul", (anatma hi martyah, [SB., II. 2. 2. 3]). [KN J-1441] "The Soul is the refuge that I have gone unto". For anatta is not said of the Self/Soul but what it is not. There is never a `doctrine of no-Soul', but a doctrine of what the Soul is not (form is anatta, feelings are anatta, etc.).         It is of course true that the Buddha denied the existence of the mere empirical "self" in the very meaning of "my-self" (this person so-and-so, namo-rupa, an-atta), one might say in accordance with the command `denegat seipsum, [Mark VII.34]; but this is not what modern writers mean to say, or are understood by their readers to say; what they mean to say is that the Buddha denied the immortal(amata), the unborn (ajata) and Supreme-Self (mahatta') of the Upanishads. And that is palpably false, for he frequently speaks of this Self, or Spirit (mahapurisha), and nowhere more clearly than in the too often repeated formula 'na me so atta', "This/these are not my Soul" (na me so atta'= anatta/anatman), excluding body (rupa) and the components of empirical consciousness (vinnana/ nama), a statement to which the words of Sankhara are peculiarly apposite, "Whenever we deny something unreal, is it in reference to something real"[Br. Sutra III.2.22]. It was not for the Buddha but for the nihilist (natthika)to deny the Soul.         Outside of going into the doctrines of later schisms of Buddhism, Sarvastivada, Theravada, Vajrayana, Madhyamika, and lastly Zen, the oldest existing texts (Nikayas) of Buddhism which predate all these later schools of Buddhism, anatta is never used pejoratively in any sense in the Nikayas by Gotama the Buddha, who himself has said: [MN 1.140] "Both formerly and now, I've never been a nihilist (vinayika), never been one who teaches the annihilation of a being, rather taught only the source of suffering, and its ending" Further investigation into Negative theology is the source which should be referenced in further understanding the methodology which the term anatta illuminates.         Due to secular propagation, a general acceptance of the concept of "A Doctrine of Anatta" exists as status quo, however there exists no substantiation in sutra for Buddhism's denial of soul, or in using the term anatta in anything but a positive sense in denying Self-Nature, the Soul, to any one of a conglomeration of corporeal and empirical phenomena which were by their very transitory nature, "impermanent (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and Selfless (anatta)". The only noun in sutra which is referred to as "permanent (nicca)" is the Soul, such as Samyutta Nikaya 1.169.         In fact the phrase "Doctrine of anatta", or "Anatmavada" is a concept utterly foreign to Buddhist Sutra, existing in only non-doctrinal Theravada and Madhyamika commentaries. As the saying goes, a "lie repeated often enough over time becomes the truth". Those interested parties to Buddhism incapable of pouring through endless piles of Buddhist doctrine have defacto accepted the notion of a "Doctrine of  anatta" as key to Buddhism itself, when in fact there exists not one citation of this concept in either the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara, or Khuddaka Nikayas. Unless evoking a fallacy, we must stick  strictly to sutra as reference, wherein the usage of anatta never falls outside of the parameter of merely denying Self or Soul to the profane and transitory phenomena of temporal and samsaric life which is "subject to arising and passing", and which is most certain not (AN) our Soul (ATTA). Certainly the most simple philosophical logic would lead anyone to conclude that no part of this frail body is "my Self, is That which I am", is "not my Soul", of which Gotama the Buddha was wholeheartedly in agreement that no part of it was the Soul, i.e. was in fact anatta.         The perfect contextual usage of anatta is: "Whatever form, feelings, perceptions, experiences, or consciousness there is (the five aggregates), these he sees to be without permanence, as suffering, as ill, as a plague, a boil, a sting, a pain, an affliction, as foreign, as otherness, as empty (suññato), as Selfless (anattato). So he turns his mind away from these and gathers his mind/will within the realm of Immortality (amataya dhatuya). This is tranquility; this is that which is most excellent!" [MN 1.436]         The term anatman is found not only in Buddhist sutras, but also in the Upanishads and lavishly so in the writings of Samkara, the founder of Advaita Vedanta. Anatman is a common via negativa (neti neti, not this, not that) teaching method common to Vedanta, Neoplatonism, early Christian mystics, and others, wherein nothing affirmative can be said of what is "beyond speculation, beyond words, and concepts" thereby eliminating all positive characteristics that might be thought to apply to the Soul, or be attributed to it; to wit that the Subjective ontological Self-Nature (svabhava) can never be known objectively, but only thru "the denial of all things which it (the Soul) is not"- Meister Eckhart. This doctrine is also called by the Greeks Apophasis.  
 The classic easy-to-use and pantry-friendly Better Homes and Garden Cookbook is pretty much in every kitchen in America and chances are, it's already in yours too.  If so, then then there's nothing in this obnoxiously-colored cookbook for kids that you couldn't find in either the adult BH & H cookbook or a back issue of Family Circle.  With a few exceptions, (most notably the breakfast pizza and the Hula Stir Fry) it's all extremly standard fare.  The only thing that sets it apart is the crazy fonts and colors so obnoxious that I had to wait ten minutes between reading it and writing this review so I could see straight again.  I mean, are you really in need of another chicken nugget recipe?  Isn't there anything more interesting they could come up with?  And it isn't written to make the cooking any easier for kids--they might as well grab your adult copy and save their vision.  If you're looking for a kid's cookbook that's full of good projects that will appeal to your children, I recommend the Everything Kid's Cookbook which has a black on white format, crossword puzzles and word finds for the older kids, and easy to follow instructions along with five really terrific projects that the kids can whip up for play, like bubbles and play dough.  Mom and Me by Annabel Karmel is also a much, much better selection, with easy to follow illustrated directions.  This is a suped-up version of standard fare you'd be better off skipping 
 the TRUTH. This is the third book of Ms. Meades I have read and again stockpiled with errors. She tried to be scandalous, but comes of as a gossip. There is only one word of advice I have for Ms. Meade: RESEARCH.  I know you'll have to look that one up 
 I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturer never sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity 
 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
  The book is beautiful, no doubt. The figures and summury tables are great. However, the book lacked clarity (in my opinion at least). Comparing it to books like Lathi's Modern Communication Systems and Dorf's Modern Control Systems, it really fails in motivating the equations and mathematical derivations. Lots of very important formulas and conclusions just seem to pop-up.   Most of the excersises were also very difficult to understand in light of the given information in the text.  I recall reading the never-ending pages in the physics of BJTs with hardly a clue to what really was going on. Most of the other students merely jumped to the modeled equations  and didn't bother at all with the underlying physics.  To be fare though I must say I didn't read any other book on general electronics (we moved on to specialized courses in intstrumentation)so the book might be a lot better then others 
 Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on 
 The board for this game is a pain...half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick.  It takes forever and a day to look in the book, locate the letters' locations, and uncover them too.  I love Wheel of Fortune, but you're better off playing a computerized version where you don't have all the hassle 
 While I am sure the contents are as fullfilling as all Deepak's literature, I was not aware that this was a "pocket" size book.  The caption read "Abridged" but I did not see anywhere that it said "pocket size".  Not only that, the price printed on the cover was $3.50 but Amazon charged $4.95 (before shipping & handling)  Buyers beware and get out your magnifying glass 
 This product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  This little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). I initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128MB card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. A firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but I could never get the file to load into the frame. Another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  It would have been nice to hear a RANDOM music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. Definitely NOT worth the price. Shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 The book never arrived--Instead I was sent (3 months later) a small paperback entitled "Helping Children Accept Themseves and Others" from Better World Books.  Perhaps Adam Smith would agree that this is the market at work but in the future "Better World Books" will not be my market 
 That this dismal collection of stories comes from a former Pulitzer winner is most disheartening.  The problem is not the novel premise of using tabloid headlines to launch stories, rather, it is the complete lack of insight and imagination that is at work here.  Oh, some of the pieces are clever, milking their conceits for some easy laughs, but never does this come close to the true vision of Butler's prizewinning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain.  While trying to bring love and understanding to these misunderstood souls, Butler manages only feeble insights, the worst of which, as in "Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover," descend into cheapness.  The best story in the collection, "Jealous Husband Returns in the Form of Parrot," is a rehashing of "Love," a story from Good Scent.  Even worse, Butler's prose, usually not a problem, clunks over attempts at the various dialects ranging from a Britisher on the Titanic to the Alabaman searching for her spaceman.  Hopefully, this book was an attempt to cash in, but if not, Butler has betrayed the promise of possibly great write 
 For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling "gansta grizzel" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up 
 The instructions that you do get are wrong.  The items I get and the ones listed are totally different.  It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools.  Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it.  The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me!  
 first off, let me say i LOVE tortoise... one of the very, very best.  20 years from now they will be studied and broken down like miles davis or coltrane by aspiring musicians.  perfection.    but this boxset was one of the biggest dissapointments i have ever had with a music purchase.  over the span of 3 cd's there was almost NOTHING to catch the ear... unless you are a tortoise junkie and every blippity-bloopin remix is pure heaven.  there is a reason these tracks have never been formally released--they are shockingly subpar for a band as monolithic as tortoise.  and why would someone ever take something as perfect and untouchable as a tortoise track and rip it up into tiny little pieces, assembling it into something so obviously distant in quality from the original?  c'mon.   the dvd wasn't much better either.  there were only a couple of live clips of high quality, the rest was purely for archival purposes and nothing more.  blah 
 The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.  The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling.  I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book. 
 The book starts out reasonably well enough, with Davidson drawing you into the overview of the life of Carl Sagan's parents.  But as the book progresses, you begin to see another side to the story of Sagan's life that you weren't expecting.  Davidson doesn't hesitate to make broad generalizations and interpretations of his interviews with people in Sagan's life, even making borderline psychoanalytical conclusions to explain his behavior when Davidson is clearly not qualified in this area.  There were several points where I read a line and found myself just staring at the book with a gaping jaw and a sense of incredulility, wondering how he could make such a strange conclusion.  For example, when he discussed Sagan's novel Contact, it quickly became apparant that Davidson hadn't even read the book or he wouldn't be making such strange interpretations of the book's plot.  Additionally, Davidson's writing is incredibly simplistic; although it may appear vivid and engaging on the surface, it is full of groan-inducing cliches and overdramatized descriptions of events.  This, in combination with his purely speculative conclusions on Sagan's personality, made me want to vomit.  Overall, although I was able to glimpse a small part of what made Carl Sagan so special and see a somewhat decent overview of the events in his life, I feel I was getting a blurry and distorted picture of who the man really was 
 Dear Nerd,  How's your imaginary world doing? Any good blood-letting or disembowelments lately? Not too many, I hope. You'll run out of imaginary friends/enemies pretty soon if you don't ration yourself! I'd hate to see that happen.  But seriously though, how's losers anonymous going? Just because you were picked on in high school doesn't mean that you have to resort to spelling magic m-a-g-i-c-k, or just making up words to be clever. Especially since it isn't really clever at all.   What's that, you say? Witchcraft is real? Instead of writing that here, you should try saying it out loud. Go ahead. There you go, good girl. Sounds pretty stupid doesn't it? I mean, come on now, even the atheists have a better grasp on reality than you do. They at least use a cowardly sort of logic for their basis of self worship, but you've got, what, your lonely imagination and fairy tales?  Oh wow, get a load of the book description! "Approach with caution, you may open the gates of hell within!" Shouldn't that read, "Approach with caution, this book will prevent you from ever getting laid"? Swamp thing from last night's naked tree dance DOES NOT count.  The Bottom Line: If you're weak minded enough to actually buy into this childishness, then please, Harry Potter, go right ahead buy a copy. Otherwise, try finding a more constructive way resurrecting your self esteem. If you don't respect yourself, no one else will either.   Sincerely,     - Someone who prays you will not try to reproduce. 
 I wanted to love Jamaica Kincaid -- I really did. I first picked up Lucy expecting to love it because I had heard such wonderful things about Kincaid.  What a pathetic disappointment.  The novel drones on with no purpose and little plot. The writing is on the level of a pre-teen novel. In fact, had I read this when I was 13, it would have been incredible. Unfortunately, I'm not 13 anymore.  The overarching flaw in Lucy is that the reader has absolutely no reason to care about the title character. She hates her new home -- for no reason. She hates her old home -- for no reason. She hates everyone she meets -- for no reason.  At least once in every section she mentions how she either hates something or how something doesn't meet her approval -- however, we are never given a reason for her disdain or her high standards. In fact, we are given the opposite -- we are continually reminded of how ignorant Lucy is by her incessant complaining and idiotic comments.  The character is supposed to be powerful and honest and courageous. In reality she is self-absorbed, ignorant, and dull.  I really did want to like this book. Unfortunately, it's the kind of novel that will be praised by people who don't know any better -- who praise books simply because Oprah liked them.  If you've got nothing better to read when you go to the beach one day, it's fine -- just don't expect to be impressed or empowered by it. It's nothing more than a dimestore rag 
 it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage 
 After seeing Ted nearly amputate his own leg on TV while cutting down a sapling that a boy scout could've cut down with a Gerber camp axe, I have decided to dismiss Teddie as a bombastic nutjob who will, in the end, be a caustic detriment to the TRUE culture of sportsmen in America.  Oh God no!  I'm starting to sound like him now!  The near amputation actually was the beginning of the slide for me.  Reading his article in American Hunter of Dec 2005 and then re-reading this book actually sealed the deal.  Ted is not the epitome of true sportsmen!  It was bad enough watching Kerry drag around geese that had been dead for a week during election time to try to gain the Duck's Unlimited vote but watching Ted do anything in the name of modern sportsmen is just as bad.  How can Ted's actions help our image?  There's an old saying in the South: An empty can rattles the most.  Holds true for Ted 
 I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching.  
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 Maybe it is me but I dont think this book was proofed very well. Lessons just don't seem to work the way they should. In fact there are some I just can't complete 
 If you're hoping for that "dishy," tell-all, spicy account of Tallulah's life, this ISN'T it!  That bio is still to be written.  This attempt at capturing the essence of the grande dame suffers from two fatal diseases:  tedium and barely tolerable--lethal combinations in any dose.  And, there are glaring errors of fact.  Someone fell asleep at the research table!  Better to view some of la Bankhead's films than try to wade through these waters.  Anyone got a Lifeboat?!! 
 I will be succint:  This book is absolutley worthless.  Do not buy it unless you want to feel as ripped-off as I do 
 I don't know what it is with American horror cinema these days, its like movies start off with a good idea, and then someone says "what can we do to foul it up as much as humanly possible?". This must be why so many Japanese horror pics are being remade by Hollywood....even WE are getting tired of remaking the same garbage. White Noise starts off with an interesting (albeit formulaic) idea..... Man loses wife whom he loves and realizes he can communicate with her using EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) and instead unleashes something he never intended. Simple right? Well...somewhere between there and the screen this thing got lost. It keeps a few good jumps and jolts, being able to scare you at the best moments, but, that doesn't make up for the endless minutes of Michael Keaton staring at a static filled screen and then doing things that no person in their right mind would do without bringing along backup or at least a weapon. At one point, I even yelled at the screen (much to my girlfriends chagrin), "Keaton! If you go through that door and something kicks your butt, you brought it on yourself idiot!". The bland formula this film follows is so predictable, that not even it's surprise "surprise" ending shocks you, it just leaves you thinking, ahhhh well, at least we wont have a sequel. 
 "Mark's Handbook" is one of those books you hear other students in college talk about like it's a must have that you'll use for the rest of your life. But it's not. I bought this book, and six years out of college I barely ever crack it open. It's packed with information, but it's so general that you can't get any real-world specific information out of it. It's like a restaurant reviewer who can tell you that "New York has some great Italian restaurants" but doesn't give you the name of any of them. You're much better off skipping this book and buying one that's more specific to your particular field. As an example, the mechanical engineer is much better off with Shigley's "Mechanical Engineering Design" 
 I would have given this zero stars but the software won't allow me to.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to get the solutions manual that floats around on college campuses.  The text is mediocre at best but the homework problems are horrendous.  They lack explanation and the sub-par TA's that grade your homework won't catch all of the errors in the solutions.  You will miss problems that you actually solved correctly and you will have to go to your professor to have things changed.  Even worse is when one of the God-forbidden homework problems gets used on an exam.  The whole process happens over again but everyone suffers.  If this book had better examples and homework problems along the lines of the examples it would be much better.  The sad thing: you usually buy this book because you have to, not because you want to.  
 Same theme and style all the way through almost monotone, nothing stood out on this one.  I played once and it's sitting on the shelf 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 Did not like, thought stories were full of Idealistic nonsense. Unrealistic options for the family farmer. 
 Some exercises at the end of each chapter can be calculated with somewhat simpler formulas than the ones in the book. The organization of the book is acceptable but it does NOT give thorough explanations by "showing" with example calculations.  Therefore, ONLY FEW formulas are presented in the book. This book is not user friendly, especially for students 
 I purchased this book with the intention of reading gritty tales of growing up in the South, not lesbian porn.  I do not have a problem with Ms. Allison's sexual preference; some of what she had to say about being a lesbian was interesting.  However, I found this book to be pornographic and disgusting.  I did not realize that 80% of this book was detailed sexual encounters.  For example, one story describes her partner urinating on her face. I do not recommend this book 
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 You only have to read the first chapter of this book to get the whole feel of it. Yes, she was fat. Yes, she was abused. You know what, Ms. Moore? So were millions of other kids. All you wanted was a loving, happy family? Yes, so do millions of other kids.  Other reviewers say this book is intense and raw: maybe so, but I also think it was boring and full of self-hatred. Why waste time reading something like that? 
 Far too many of the tofu recipes in this book consist of taking a block of tofu, slicing it, frying the slices and then covering them with sauce. (Tofu with Mole Sauce, I'm looking at you!)  Other recipes fail because they simply try to replace meat with tofu or tempeh, rather than trying to be completely new recipes in which the soy product can shine on its own, rather than as a substitute.  So far, there are only 2 recipes that I would recommend - the Spinach Burgers and the Brown Rice Pilaf. The rest? Meh. I'm still looking for a really good tofu cookbook 
 There was some hype about this book - it made it to a few 'Great New Books' Lists, so I was eager to read it.  I haven't been able to finish it and have abandoned it for more interesting (captivating) works.  The short stories are adequately written and could actually have been something if there was ever a purpose to the writing.  They leave you scratching your head and saying, "so, where's the end - what's the point?"  It did not hold my attention, I was not engaged by it, which is why it was shelved before finishing in favor of something else 
 Unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship, this toy is a complete waste of money. My son had been wanting the Black Pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him.  Buyer beware 
 Kipnis uses her mindlessly wielded implicit racism to make jokes about rape that reinforce the myth that her audience (explicitly white upper middle class women whose money she wants) are raped by strangers (when even ABC news admits that the vast majority of rape victims are raped by people in their own socioeconomic group...who they already know).  She's not accountable to her audience, she's merely profittng from the hyper-spending tendencies that she diagnosis them with.  When I had the disheartening opportunity to discuss the book with her she used every tactic of male chauvinism to dismiss my critique of her book's racism...even to the extent of insisting that since her editor was black she couldn't be racist.   Don't waste your time 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 I did not like this book because it seemed to me that the author just went to the library and got all of his information for the book. He did not do a study of his own to confirm his findings. He just believed everybody elses research instead. Also he does not state why he believes this information  to be true or why it would be true. There is some information that is  helpful but it is very scientific and a little hard to understand without  going back over it a couple times to review it. I have also read a book by  Dr.Shettles and its very easy to understand and he explains why he believes  all of his findings to be true. We will use Dr.Shettles' method 
 I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book!  This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit.   Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with).  She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability.  After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the "myth" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.  I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman!  Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy,  Entrepeneur and Diplomat!  And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all. 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 This book was awful. THe author is a bad writer in general. Also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is NOT recovered. This means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. There is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, "Look how thin I am, I just CAN'T eat." It's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. She still lived with her parents for the majority of her life 
 After reading all of the reviews on this book I was left confused by the extreme selection of critiques. After seeing the beautiful carrot cakes on the cover I decided this could hardly be the work of a "sloppy" decorator and went ahead and ordered. What can I say, the cover most definitely does not reflect the level of work inside, which can only be described as ..well.. sloppy! My 12 year old daughter had produced better looking cookies than these!! I can't say anything about the recipes because quite frankly none of them inspired me to try. The only thing that interested me was the explanation on how to make checkerboard or pinwheel cookies, but I didn't need to buy a book just for that. So, if you're undecided about whether to purchase this book as I was, my advice is save your money 
 Luckily this book is only 160 pages, so I didn't waste too much time. It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward. Very few examples of why and how this happened.  I thought it was going to be a history of Islam, but it's more a history of Islamic nations. It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.   It'll say things like, "Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries." Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.  I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one 
 The fuss over Forrest Gump still amazes me. This movie basically rips off better movies in almost every scene. Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light 
 I picked up a copy of this book because of all the great reviews.  I have a 3 month old and started back to work a few weeks ago.  Frankly, there wasn't much in here that I needed or didn't figure out on my own.    I am giving it two starts, instead of one, because everyone is different and what I thought to be obvious advice may be a revelation to someone else.  The one thing I have learned about parenting is that you have to figure it out what is best for you all by yourself. And if you need a book to help you, then this would certainly be a perfectly good one to pick up.  
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 This is a neat book, but only two stars because of its design. 100 short chapters uncategorized and in no particular order, with no index. There is a table of contents, of course, but the chapters are in no order and the way the chapters are titled they are not easily scanned by the eye, especially across 4-5 pages of listings. It's fun to flip through the book at random for a short while, but it's impossible to refer back to something you found useful at a later date unless you want to turn page by page until you find it. This was really a preventable problem and it's a shame it had to made an otherwise great book frustrating 
 It would be so easy to suggest a main title for the review in an obvious word play of the film, such as "this film should've stayed quiet" or "film doesn't follow own advice and shut up" but that's too easy. Because basically watching the film you start to notice you almost like it for the wrong reasons. Director Jamie Babbit, previously known for directing lesbian drama But I'm a Cheerleader, shows a family with much sordid details and secrets but just not the right approach.  The Deer family (don't laugh, that's their last name) adopt Dot, a deaf-mute who becomes a quick target for the daughter, Nina. However, Dot's seemingly useful ability to hear but not hear what people say brings about some family secrets and tension and ultimately the bigger question is what secret does Dot have that she's not sharing?  Sometimes there are lines that are obviously meant to bring about a laughter, where because it's ridiculous and toilet humor, scatching and political or just a knowing laugh like a "I know how that is". But it's a bad sign when a line, meant to be serious, brings laughter. There are several lines like this in the film including one involving a guy talking about his "manhood". The story isn't that well-written either.  The family secret is pretty rough but there's no emotional connection so the only thing bad about the secret is what it actually is and not how it affects anyone in the film.  How's the actors? Well after awhile you mistake hotness for acting. While Camille Belle was surprising in a film called the Ballad of Jack and Rose, here she's pretty good but there's not a lot of depth to the character whereas Elisha Cuthbert, equally hot, has tons of depth but maybe not acting chops at times. While she is given enough time to develop a character, it's unfortunately not enough time before we're whisked somewhere else. Then there's the whole "Dot's secret" which would've worked if she didn't narrate and there was enough scenes to have you already guessing what it was.  If there's nothing else to rent and can't find anything, give it a shot but perhaps it's best to just admire Belle and Cuthbert with the sound off. Ugh, another "quiet" joke 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Although the information in the book is detailed, more pictures are needed to give some idea how these trees and shrubs might actually enhance a garden. The photos contained in the book are sparse and are entirely in  black and white. Pictures in books? Generally not needed, but in a  gardening book, good graphics are essential 
 Imagine asking a lawyer to read your favorite news story from the past 50 years and comment on it.  They'd complain about the "lack of accuracy" or the contradictory reporting (when someone got both sides of a story).  This is what Bart Ehrman did with "Misquoting Jesus."    I was interested in this book because I had read other reports about the accuracy of the New Testament.  Many scholars said that this was the most well documented historical event in the ancient history of mankind.  However, Ehrman provides excruciating analysis of about 30 phrases and then implies that our creator should have done a better job of inspiring those first century authors if he expected us to believe them.  For example, he berates early Christians for their anti-Jewish sentiments (primarily in Acts and the epistles) as if this was typical anti-semitism in the early church.  He forgets that prior to those events, Jews rejected and ultimately persecuted early Christians, going to the point of including a curse against all heretics in their temple services.  Unfortunatley, the one sided criticism is routine in this book and makes it hard to believe that the author is being objective.  In another case, he goes to great length to say that errors could have crept into one of Paul's epistles, even though he signed the document at the bottom.  Even today, someone is expected to read and correct a document that they sign.  Apparently that's too advanced a concept for Paul of Tarsus.  Additionally, he claims that Paul "dictated" the epistle to scribes when there is a perfectly plausible alternative.  We know that Paul actually wrote many letters.  However, we also know that many of the letters he wrote are copies that he appended sayings to to show his authorization for the work.  Ehrman ignores the possibility that Paul could actually have written the epistle in question and simply had others copy the written text verbatim.  Instead, he relies on the idea that the epistle was actually "dictated" as John did with his gospel.  That's one of the explanations he uses for the POSSIBILITY that errors crept into the text.  This kind of myopia is a greasy film that covers the otherwise scholarly research in his book.  Unfortunately, if he looked at all the plausible alternatives for the possible errors, his book would have to be renamed "Possible minor inaccuracies in the greatest book ever written."  You can imagine what that might have done to book sales 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 This is a huge book but spends no more then 1 page on any topic. In my opinion the authors only have financial audit experience and little understanding of IT controls. This book shows the failure of the 'integrated auditor' as the authors are tyring to be IT auditors with little IT experience. They touch on some very good points in a few instances and, in general, the book is decent. The authors do not know much outside of the CISA, IIA and financial based certifications as they seem to think that the ISSA (Information Systems Security Assoc.) is sponsored by ISC2/CISSP's (it is not). Overall, I have not been impressed with this book 
 This is the weakest book Mr. Marquez ever wrote-a living proof that autobiographies written by the writers are sentimental drag. His usual style of fantastic truth and romatic albeit very sad fantasy is nowhere to be found. If you love Marquez, do not read this book 
 I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers about the smell of this cleaner...it almost made me lose my lunch.  Disgusting, UGH.  I suggest anyone who cannot stand this smell to use the Bissell formulations, either the Wood Floor Solutions or Hard Floor Solutions.  They have a pleasant, fresh, clean scent 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I wish I could give Ms. Anderson a more favorable review as I am an avid long time student of metaphysical principles and was really looking forward to reading this book - I liked the catchy title.  However, I must admit that I really didn't find any new breakthroughs here or new suggestions to improve my 'field playing' skills.  I also didn't particularly care for the constant references to Ms. Anderson's career - I would have liked to hear more examples of other 'players'.  Although this is simply my personal perception, Ms. Anderson's style makes her come across as rather self-absorbed when it comes to her 'abilities'.  This book will most likely not become part of my permanent collection on quantum physiscs and the art of manifestation.  I will stick with the classics instead - James Allan, Neville, Abraham-Hicks, Grabhorn, Goldsmith, Dyer, Hawkins, F.A. Wolf.      
 "A healthy, well-educated child will grow up empowered and less likely to want or need that AK-47..."  Wow, John Kerry is posting on here now!  Only stupid people want or need guns.  Just like the military !!!   Way to go, John.   Make sure that those of a lesser class understand their place and standing in your "progressive" society ...  You guys just don't get it.  The social issues ARE what's important 
 I really feel stupid about ordering this book. Why did i do it?. The story is that Stacey is moving Back to New york 
 AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!!  IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN AS ADVERTIZED!!!!  I have ordered and returned this product 3 times. It is not widescreen. There is no option to for viewing it as widescreen.  Amazon has no explanation for the mistake and unfortunately they will not correct the web page.  This leads to an interesting question.  Why does Mr. Leach state in his review that the disk offers a widescreen option when it doesn't?  Either Amazon is massively screwing up the order or he is not reviewing this actual disk from Amazon.  If that's the case, he should not be providing a review on it.  
 First off, MTV owes me my 10 bucks back for even implying that Just Surrender sound the least bit like the wonderful and talented Fall Out Boy. They don't. When I first heard ITSCT, I thought I was listening to Taking Back Sunday B-sides post-tell all your friends, and I don't even like TBS. Raspy, crude vocals and generic breakdowns are garbage, yet everyone trys to do em' anyway. I took this suckfest of a cd and threw it from my car after just three songs, so unless you like bad imitations of TBS and MCR, stay clear of JS. It's no wonder these guys never took off 
 If Apple makes everthing works as it advertized, then it's worth it 
 This book just proves that religion is something the world does not need. You can get the same effect of this book by reading a Dungeons and Dragons rule guide or listening to a Helloween song.  Avoid 
 I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:  -I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! -The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.  Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30. 
 Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre.   I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?  If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.   Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer. 
 I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking).  Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook.  That's not what it is at all.  The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful.  I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms.  Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it.  I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking 
 J.D. Salinger's last published work is more than 43 years old now, and still stirs many in the same absent way Seymour Glass animates his brother Buddy in this pair of stories first published in 1963. Are both cases of delusional devotion?  In the first story, "Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters," originally published in The New Yorker in 1955, we get what amounts to Salinger's first deep-dish treatment of the Glass family saga ("Zooey" saw print later, and previous stories featuring the Glasses were far less insular) as Buddy shows up for Seymour's wedding, only to find Seymour stood up his bride. In the second piece, 1959's "Seymour: An Introduction," Buddy foregoes any semblance of plot to explain who Seymour was.  Like a lot of other people, I am put off by the convoluted nature of "Seymour," as well as the explanations of those who defend it. Actually, there could be something to the idea of writing a plotless story, using characters like the Glasses people know from other works, but this is assuredly not it. Salinger too obviously indulges himself, spouting contempt at his generation and his critics, throwing up lame jokes and referencing obscure Japanese poets as a smokescreen to conceal his literary, intellectual, and metaphysical nakedness.  "What a marvelous convenience it would be if writers could let themselves describe their characters' clothes, article by article, crease by crease," Salinger writes in the role of Buddy, pretty much summing up the approach of "Seymour" as well as its underlying failure. His interest in his subject is not only all-consuming, it is not all that deep.  "Raise High" is a better story, though that's not saying much. "Franny And Zooey," the previously published Salinger book, also combined a better story with a weaker one, but there at least you got one terrific story in "Franny," a bold, empathetic tale of power and focus. "Raise High" doesn't know where it's going, and is in no hurry to get there. You get nice asides, like when Buddy sees an old chair and remembers a beloved bulldog, long dead, who slept there and left his chewmarks. There's also some arresting ambiguity, as when Buddy reads Seymour's journal and we get maybe a suggestion of unease at some apparent insanity.  But "Roof Beam" doesn't end so much as fizzle away, with Buddy snoozing in an empty apartment after the mystery of Seymour's absence has been resolved via an unseen phone call. Emptyness is a recurrent theme in Salinger's Glass writings, here as in "Franny & Zooey," where various Glasses are often seen in isolation thinking or writing about absent kin. For such a happy family, there's an overwhelming sadness about the Glasses that suggests Salinger found himself in a bit of a dead end with them, one from which he never emerged. Further evidence of this can be found in the web-available "Hapsworth 16, 1924," Salinger's last public blast, published in The New Yorker in 1965.  Salinger was one of the most important American writers of our lifetime, not to mention a seminal figure of our culture, but his greatness lies elsewhere, not here. Read this only if you are a Salinger completist, or else interested in the price genius can extract from its recipients 
 This is my third pregnancy and I don't want to gain as much weight as I have in my two previous pregnancies.  I was disappointed by The Pregnancy Diet because it failed to tell me how to control my weight and cravings.  I was looking for more information on eating healty filling foods, not cutting back on my meals 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 The previous reviewer has it right.  Use this book for phone numbers and the most general info--like what the uniform looks like for 8th graders. The parental quotes are the most egregious.  And some schools are seemingly damned with faint praise (a school that educates nearly 1000 students pre-k to 12 gets a one page write-up) while others, usually UES and UWS schools, go on for page after page even though the school might only have a couple of hundred students.  I have the sense that it's simply because the authors don't happen to have any friends at some schools.  There's no real information here that you won't get from the school's own glossy brochures.  I have a 3rd edition and a 5th edition and it is updated only on the most basic info such as tuition--even for some of the best known schools in NY.  Other NYC guide books to the public schools get the format right.  With people spending up to $30K per year on private schools, they deserve a better consumer guide than this one.  Borrow this book--don't buy it 
 There needs to be a good book written about accessing the world by the physically handicapped, unfortunately this one is not very current.  While it has a lot of information, most of it is so general it is of little use.   If you are an adult who became handicapped yesterday and have never  travelled anywhere, you may pick up a tidbit or two.  Otherwise, don't  bother 
 This book makes good points about how computer usability problems impact productivity.  The author argues that computers had a negative impact on productivity in the years 1973-1993, but misses the idea that these were  years of learning to incorporate computer technology deeply into business  processes.  Four year later, his argument that computers do not have a  dramatic and positive impact on economic productivity seems quaint 
 Rarely do I just write off a book especially of such a prolific writer as Coetzee but this book is such an utter disappointment in his career and its only value lies in that it will prepare you for the even bigger disappointment of his most recent novel, Elizabeth Costello which this book is a precursor. I am not violently opposed to this book neither is the writing that excessively bad...the book is a definition of the utter waste of time. 
 A sequel? There really is a Satan.   Meyer has proven to be one of the most annoying and somnambulistic of writers. I had to laugh when I saw her brilliant new plot outline involves the ever nilhistic and dull Bella making time with wherewolves for another eternity of pages. I suppose in book three Bella will finally give up the big prize and "go all the way" with a zombie, which is pretty much all that will be left of Meyer's fan base.   Honestly the woman's purile writing induces narcolepsy! What really concerns me is the apparent inability of reader's to recognize the difference between a good book and a real stinker.  Meyer is still a big P.U. in literature 
 I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke.  The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.  Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.  I don't recommend it 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 I am a life long fan of Blue Oyster Cult and Love Bucks album "Flat Out", but this is nothing to compare to.  This album may have been recorded in the bathroom since it is so "POOPY".  Dont even waste your time to listen to it like I did.  I still cannot beleive that this came from the talented mind of Buck.  Go back to what works "Flat Out" and any BOC, but dont buy this one, because you will need some baby wipes to clean up the crap 
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this cd wanting to hear some new rockabilly bands I was not familiar with, but I was severly dissapointed. The quality of the tracks on this cd are mediocre at best and some are just downright bad, the two standout tracks are red hot and real gone by the spinouts(great tune, good hook, excellent slap bass, guitar interplay)The other standout is girl of my dreams,by peter and the wolves very Elvis, Maries the Name era early sixties sounding. The majority of the other tunes are just dowright pitiful.If you are new to the rockabilly scene, a few helpful suggestions, The Stray Cats, The Blasters, Robert Gordon, The Planet Rockers, Sun era and 56-59 Elvis, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the list goes on and on of better spent dollars on QUALITY rockabilly music, apologies to these artists, but if this is the current state of rockabilly, please somebody help us!!!!! 
 It's definately a good starting point for a reference library, yet it still seems to leave a lot out. For example, it does little to explain world-building and gives less-than-detailed examples in a lot of the book's sections. Most of the info in the book can be found with a search engine. I recommend it only for those of you who want to build a decent reference library 
 The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society 
 I got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how Coach K motivates his teams, organizes his practice sessions, and instills leadership qualities in his athletes.  What I got was a less than thrilling re-hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter.  You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book.  I didn't, so I gave it to one of my co-workers who graduated from Duke.  He likes it 
 I have lived in or near several of the places reviewed in this book and find the descriptions to be less than 100% and the weather data to be quite different than I experienced while living there. Since I know the data for these places was less than 'on track', I did not have confidence in the  information presented for other areas of the country. I recommend  "Retirement Places Rated". It seems to present data that agrees  with my experience 
 What Prince made so special in the 80ties was his abbillity to create innovative music and at the same time appeal to a big audience. Diamond and Pearls appealed to the crowd, considering the 2 million copies it saled, but there is nothing new or exiting to be found on it. Prince even becomes a trendfollower by introducing rap in his music (Jughead) And offcourse there is "Gett off", a nice funk tune, but like all tracks on this cd, very mainstream. Many of the singles that were pulled from this album became great hits (Diamonds and Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2Night), but they are also amoungst his most uneventfull songs. It shows that being a commercial hit does not equal quality. Only "Willing and Able" and "Strollin'" are showing a tiny glimpse of Prince's true talent and his willingness to experiment with his music. Prince made over 30 albums in his career (I'm proud owner of all of them) and I'm sorry to say this album belongs in the bottomhalf of his catalogue. It was one of his biggest commercial successes and the album sold millions of coppies, but it is also very "middle of the road". It misses spontanity and originality. What is left is a well produced R&B album (perhaps even overproduced), with a handfull of good songs. But non will leave a lasting impression or define Prince's talent. If you seek to be introduced to Prince music get Purple Rain, Sign Of The Times or Lovesexy instead.   
 Plodding melodrama bogged down by each characters lethargic reminiscence of earlier days that would have been better, could have been better"if only".  If you've read the editor's review, you don't need to read the story, it's all been said, and much less painfully. 
 I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times. 
 I found this book to be very biased and offensive.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, her section on hyperemesis is downright wrong and condescending.  As long as you have a healthy pregnancy and want a natural childbirth, you might like this book.  For the rest of the world that lives in reality, you might find her narrow-minded approach offensive 
 For someone with apparent credentials to write about the life of Jesus, Borg shows an amazing ineptitude. He claims "What was his [Jesus] message? Most centrally, it was about himself: his own identity as the Son of God, the saving purpose of his death, and the importance of believing in him. (p. 2)" EXCUSE ME. What Gospel has he been reading? The Gospel According to Paul, I think, which is no gospel at all. The perversion of the message of Jesus with the message of Paul is one of the great crimes on the past 2000 years, and Borg's own Christian background appears to have influenced his thinking here. Jesus' message, if I have to remind him, was about love for each other and for ourselves. Yes, and he had some stuff to say about loving God and following the law.   As if misunderstanding Jesus was not a sufficient cause to never read this book, Borg spends far too much time talking about himself. Quite frankly, I don't care.  I'm also highly suspicious of anyone who talks about the "Jesus of Nazareth" without brackets, because it has become apparent to anyone who studied archeology, Josephus, the Old Testament, the Talmud, and virtually any other piece of contemporaneous Christian literature that the town of Nazareth didn't exist until after Jesus' death. Any scholar who still speaks about Jesus of Nazareth (instead of Jesus the Nazorene, which is the proper translation) is no scholar at all 
 I grew up in the '50s and my Mother had several cookbooks but "Joy of Cooking" was the bible. All my childhood favorites come from the book and when I moved out on my own it was the basic cookbook on which I relied. I bought a more recent version about 15 to 20 years ago but it wasn't as good. This is NOT the version with which I grew up. It's recipes are few, very dated, and, mostly, uninteresting. If you like oysters there's several.  An interesting read for it's historical and sociologic value but not worth purchasing for the recipes themselves. Frankly, there are no recipes that I would try because either they are boring or they have been updated by more interesting versions 
 Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, "Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?"  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.      That type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up.  The "major" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.    Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3 
 Order-soon to be on an first come first serve order and they go fast 
 I find Podhoretz to be a pitiable unimpressive individual, a bitter pathetic old man. He recently stated on Fresh Air with Terry Gross that he has no friends who disagree with him. He lamented this as if to blame it on others stating that politics are the new religion and this is why the polarization in this country exists as it does. If for no other reason it is for the cavalier disregard he expresses for human life. One cannot find intolerance unless one is himself intolerant. I have many people who call me friend whom I disagree with on political issues.   Podhoretz and those who embrace the sick and twisted vision of "neoconservativism" are themselves more dangerous and fanatical than those they are seeking to defeat. If Podhoretz and his fellow neocons are what America has become than America must surely fail, in Iraq and elsewhere. They have debased and perverted what they claim they are seeking to defend. There is nothing noble in the unenlightened neoconservative vision of American hegemony.  No one in America has learned any lessons from the events of Sept 11, 2001 because no one has as yet examined the genuine cause for the behavior of terrorists. The past half century of American foreign policy has been one of nothing but blatant hypocrisy.   I wouldn't gratify the perpetrator of these insane ramblings by giving him any money for this or anything else he or any of his fellow conspirators have written and neither should anyone else. 
 It is interesting that you posted only one comment, and of course it is a "raving" one.  This book has no merit and doesn't warrent the time it takes to read it 
 MacArthur is a blessed teacher of the Word.  He has great passion when he preaches, I wish all pastors had the passion that he has from the pulpit.  But it is my greatest desire the MacArthur learns to use love to correct someone.  I have been to his church and have heard great meaty sermons but there was no love in that church.    Many people do not know this but John spoke with Jack Hayford (pastor of Church on the Way in Van Nuys, also president of the FoursSquare denomination) on the phone before the book was released and John said this book was not about him or his church.  Interestingly enough within these pages, John mocks a vision that Jack recieved.  Either John needed to fire the ghost writer or he should be truthful in all things.    As for the Charismatic movement, I am greatly sad for what it has turned into.  There is some goofy doctrine out there, and it should be corrected, but with love first.  Jack Hayford himself lovingly corrected Benny Hinn in 1994 about blowing on people, and Benny Hinn accepted the correction with grace.  I would listen to MacArthur if this book was written as a true concern for these people listed in the book.    For the gifts, if one truly does a study of the church fathers, the gifts decrease but never cease entirely.  Augustine himself later went back on his statement that the gifts ceased.  It is always good to have all the information before coming to a stanse on this controversial issue.    With anything, do it with love.  Go ahead, read the book.  I don't need to defend the Holy Spirit, He doesn't need defending 
 I can't say enuff 'bout this but I thought it was a novel that has to deal w/ life of something like from famous black authors of Richard Wright to Langston Hughes to Ralph Ellison or somethin like that. I believe it's a ok book even tho I don't read it very oftenly all the time 'cuz it deals w/ the situations between HIV/AIDS, sex and celibacy. First of all I never read a sex book in my life. I thought it was cool but it goes to tell you how to beware about the diffrence bout the good side vs. the bad side of sex. I'ma think I'll keep it 'round a lil longer or so. Good work E. Lynn Harris 
 I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band.. 
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 This kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. Unfortunately, Kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.  Fine, I thought, I'll buy a separate cartridge. Guess what? You can't! Kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. Why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? Seems pretty dirty 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 This is the pooest book I have ever read. You don't know what the author is triing to clarify. All the equatios seem to have jumped out without any derivation. The author lacks stern mathematic fundamentals 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else 
 There's really nothing much here that hasn't been reissued previously again and again and again. All these Oliver sets sound like they're derived from the same sources and just recycled by different labels. These are dull, bland sounding transfers. The only thing this set has going for it is that it's "complete". Otherwise, it doesn't make for very satisfying listening 
 No earth shattering or interesting receipes here.  You can find most of the party ideas online 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 And, if this is an illustration of the "joy" of writing sex, I would hate to see an illustration of the "horror" or writing sex.  One of the short-shorts in the version I purchased of this book details the experience of a male gas station clerk being highly aroused when another male enters his gas station and rapes him in the back room. Is this a sex scene worthy of a story to be sold as literature, or is it a transcribed version of something someone saw at a pay site on the Internet? Do we really want to be sending a message to the public that rape is an acceptable, exciting form of sexual intercourse? I can think of several victims I know who would not appreciate that, one of whom was killed by her attacker 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book.  Boy was I wrong!  Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know.  And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult 
 I found this DVD real cheap and bought it. I really tried hard to like the movie, but I just couldn't because the acting was incredibly bad, especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city. Even the guys who don't have lines display bad performances.   An hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie. I broke this DVD and threw it out, something I've only done to 4-5 DVDs I felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth 
 This is a $22 tee ball? Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place, since these should cost about $2 at your local sporting goods store. Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package (but it doesn't say that clearly on the page).  Bottom line is don't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue 
 The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great.  It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC:  you can download your exercise data, and also change the settings for the watch from the computer.  This is great, because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons. The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer.  For whatever reason, Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft.  When installing the driver from the included CD, warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding, which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have.  There is no updated version available for download from the internet.  I went ahead and installed the driver, but since doing so, the computer has not been functioning properly, and I've been getting those "send error report / don't send error report" pop-ups from Windows.  Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is "fine" for use.  I'm no computer expert, so I don't know for sure, but I don't believe them 
 I think this movie just falls into the so bad it's good category.  It's like a car wreck, you can't look at it but can't look away.  I actually squirm with embarrassment for the actors at times.  Sylvestor Stallone having the nerve to copy Alfred Hitchcock when he would always appear at some point in his movies for a second is just plain vanity showing, but he doesn't seem to understand that he is not even close to Alfred's league.  And the guy playing the director of the show that Tony is in, I don't think I've ever seen a grown man wearing boots to the knee that wasn't doing some kind of work that required protecting your lower legs, or on a safari or something, yet he struts around with his pants tucked into them, I guess the height of fashion in the early 80's.  The music was ok overall, but not anywhere matching Saturday Night Fever, although I did like Cynthia Rhodes singing ( if that's her singing and not a voice dubbed in), and liked her in general.  And when he's waiting for a call from the show to see if he get's in it, he's strutting around the lobby of his apartment building with this little transistor radio, with music coming out of it like it's a Bose radio.  And the ridiculous show he's supposed to be in, no one in their right minds would pay money to see it.  Yet, I still occasionally pull it out and watch it, I really don't know why, there is no explanation for it and no defense for it.  As for some of the reviewers who gave it 5 stars, good god, you people must have only seen 3 movies in your lives, Ishtar, Howard the Duck , and Staying Alive.  In this is the case, then Staying Alive is indeed a great movie.  Watch a real great movie and do a comparison.  However, I have to say John Travolta sure had a great body in it, then you see him approx. 20 years later and he let his body go to pot in Pulp Fiction.  
 Dietz writes a fairly interesting story, but his command of scientific and technical issues is sorely lacking. He shows an inability to extrapolate technological advances into improvements in weaponry. If you wish to see  well done speculations on future weaponry, read any of David Drake's  military sci fi.  Also his characters are none too deep, and the villains  are simply two dimensional. However the action is good, and the plot is  fairly interesting. Not a bad read, but nothing special 
 Some novelists are known for a pared down, no-nonsense approach to narrative, firmly delineated, plainspoken characters, crackling, lively dialogue, and swiftly moving, engrossing plots.  Lezama-Lima is not one of those authors.  It's hard to recommend a book that I have so many reservations about.  Yes, the writing is occasionally beautiful, and as an historical document of a certain type of artistic and literary milieu in Pre-Castro Cuba, it's worth something.  But I'm afraid that I'm going to have disagree with all of the reviewers here and say that LL's endless aestheticism must be something of an acquired taste.  The problem is that he writes prose too much like a poet--all florid circumlocutions with no feel for the rhythms of everyday life and speech.  No doubt he would have felt the everyday to be beneath his austere heights.  Nobody talks the way his characters do--it's all lengthy, abstruse theorizing on frequently esoteric subjects.  His essentially elitist approach to writing fiction would test the patience of anyone who looks to literature for a more immediate kind of connection.  And, sorry, Mr. White, LL is not the Latin American Proust--Proust is far more readable and speaks to more basic human experiences.          Sometimes some of the worst snobs are those (i.e., homosexuals) who have themselves suffered the most heinous abuse because of their dubious social stature--rather than reject the values of the mainstream, a writer like LL ends up embodying them and perpetuating them to an infuriating degree through his snobbish affectations.  Or else one could view his aesthetic vision as essentially escapist, understandable given the political situation in Cuba at the time.  Still, a more accurate view of what was actually happening might have been of more human interest--it would have been valuable to see how these characters strained to maintain their sensibility in view of what was actually occurring around them.  But, as it is, the book seems to exist in a vacuum with no real connection to the political situation in Cuba--its Eurocentric preoccupations offend.    
 The author was 36 when she wrote this short book in 1971 and expressed her obvious frustration with the differences between the sexes - and probably her own failure in relationships. Perhaps she thought that if she could convince the men she wanted that the reason they preferred her (prettier?) competitors was because they were being manipulated these men would suddenly see the light and want her instead.  Her 1998 introduction to the book shows that the intervening years did not bring wisdom. Even though she apparently studied medicine when she was young she obviously was not really scientifically minded and never grasped biology or the behavioural consequences of the different male and female hormones.  Vilar sees herself - and other decent women - as someone who concentrates on their own career 'and from the start renounces her own slaves and her own children'. She seems to think that children are not necessary yet children are the crux of the matter - the whole reason for males and females and all that follows this fact.   She appears to be arguing for a complete role reversal where men change to the easy, traditional female role and women to the tough but impressive traditional male role - she is a feminist who agrees with a male supremacist value system and is using reverse psychology and flattery of masculinity to convince men to give up their male supremacy and shame women into taking their place. Ummmm....  Of course this book has some truths but the basic joke soon runs thin. Rather than helping the sexes to understand each other the main result seems to be that a growing number of simple-minded men have taken up many of its silliest points and used them to assert their own sense of the superiority of the male and hatred of the female.  Do men really believe that their attraction to war games, weapons etc is really a female conspiracy against them? As for forcing women to fight wars I can just imagine the laughter of the enemy. While our forefathers could acquire more fertile females to increase their numbers when they went to war, America actually is sending their fertile women TO their enemy on a plate!!! All they have to do is capture or kill these women and there will actually be no more Americans. What a strange war strategy America has come up with!!  If Vilar had stayed with medicine perhaps she could have developed treatments for females to make them more like men eg make women continuously rather than cyclically fertile, increase their upper body strength, thicken their skin, stop the hormonal influences of pregnancy and the mother-child bond etc etc. But is this what men want? Is being male really being the ideal human?  If men do not like women they should blame their ancestral forefathers for breeding with women who had such vile traits. And if they want to change women they should breed with women who are just like men - and like Vilar, perhaps?   In 1971 it must have been hard for Esther Vilar to believe that men behaved as they did out of choice. Indeed, male behaviour is often hard for women to comprehend. How could they really be willing to pay so much for sex? How could pornography really appeal to them? How could they really enjoy war movies? Vilar thought it must be because of those very same women she hated - the ones she also was losing out to.  The sooner we get past this nonsense of how women have really had the power over men and the world the better. It's sexual reproduction, guys. Rather than looking at women to blame men would do better to look in their pants and have words with their gonads. It is in the gonads of both sexes where the power actually lies.   Vilar is a feminist who cannot see any reason why male and female are different. She cannot see any connection between the reason any of us are here today and the fact that all our female ancestors had to NOT be and behave as men. If our female ancestors had been 'men' we simply would not be here. Every fertilised egg demanded its mother's commitment (and rarely or indirectly its father's) and shaped how that commitment would express itself physically and behaviourally. Sons needed this just as much as daughters.  The sexes of all animals manipulate each other. But Vilar makes out that the male is not manipulative towards the female and this is obvious nonsense. As is all the nonsense about male intelligence or sexuality being pure and good. Yes, it can be tough being male but no tougher than being female.   If we want someone or something to blame then we must go back a billion years to when sexual reproduction evolved and set the whole reproductive dance in motion ie being male was to serve sperm and being female was to serve eggs. The fact that there are countless billions of sperm produced for each egg has obviously caused physical and behavioural differences in the respective bodies that produced them. Once mammals evolved the reproductive demands on the two sexes caused massive divergence in what it was to be a successful male or a successful female - ie to become one of our ancestors.  Men cannot expect women's sympathy when they do not appreciate the importance of evolved female traits (which are nothing like most of those Vilar has made up) or, like Vilar, come out with sheer nonsense about the superiority of masculinity.    
      Based both on its title and on the fact that this book is a publication of the American Folklore Society, I expected to find a collection of first-person reminiscences, perhaps embellished as all effective stories are embellished by their tellers, though retaining basic truths, painting a verbal picture of the daily lives of the men who worked as uniformed porters in the expensive sleeping cars owned by the Pullman Company.  As an identifiable group, Pullman porters were as much a fixture of American railroads as were Harvey Girls on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe lines, and both groups were in a position to acquire limitless experiences relating to the traveling public.  The porters interacted not only with one another and with other members of train crews, notably conductors, but also with thousands of travelers.  Surely, serving in such a position engendered countless stories of intriguing human interaction as well as unpublished tales of railroad operations.       Alas, those limitless, countless stories may indeed have been lost to history.  At least, they were lost to the author of this book.  Santino has not written a book of folklore at all but rather a treatise on the sociology of the group.  He has also stirred in copious condemnation of the Pullman Company for its racist employment practices, a heaping of hero worship for A. Philip Randolph, founder of the porters' union, and a propensity for blaming all the ills of corporate society on the aftereffects of slavery.       For instance, the practice of tipping, which augmented the porters' actual salaries, Santino relates to the buying and selling of slaves, identifying it as a demeaning and insulting practice.  How he might explain the tipping of caucasian service workers in restaurant and tonsorial occupations, inasmuch as none of their ancestors were ever sold as slaves, remains a conundrum. He points out the rabid opposition of the Pullman Company to the formation of a porters' union, but he ignores the equally strong opposition of companies of that era to the formation of any union, even one totally caucasian in makeup.  White unionists were beaten, branded as "bolsheviks," and run out of the county without regard to their race, and his book does not relate any intimidation of black unionists that exceeded that exerted against white labor organizers.       Santino even equates the fact that porters were expected to smile and be subserviently gracious to their customers as a holdover from slave days.  I am under the distinct impression that any professional employee--caucasian, black, oriental, whatever--in a service industry considers respectful pleasantry to customers as part of the job for which they are being paid.       Despite the fact that this book contains all of two or three, or, if we stretch, four folklore stories in it, one of which, the blank check from the Pullman Company to A. Philip Randolph, is repeated continually, it does have some good historical information in it.  The formation of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was indeed a noteworthy accomplishment in the story of the American labor movement.  The fact that porters were uniformly called "George" by the passengers of the day is an interesting bit of trivia about railroad culture (though whether the use of that name really smacks of slaves who often took the names of their owners, as in George Pullman, may be questionable).  That men closely associated with the porters' union played pivotal roles in both the Montgomery bus boycott following Rosa Parks' arrest and in the March on Washington that brought Martin Luther King into the public eye are facts that had previously escaped my attention.       I did find value in Santino's discussion of the formation of the union and perhaps in its contribution to the historical record of an occupational group that was once well known in the United States and which certainly contributed to the development of its culture and economy.  Unfortunately, any folkloric history of the Pullman porter is yet to be written. Santino's book is generally worth reading if one can find it on a library shelf; whether it deserves to be purchased and given a permanent spot on the reader's bookshelf may be another matter 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 This volume is not up to the standards set by previous collections in the series.  It contains far too many stories that are mediocre or worse.  If 2003 just wasn't a very good year for S-F, Dozois made a mistake in including "more than 300,000 words of fantastic fiction. 
 Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson have a few good moments in the Nick and Jessica Variety Hour. But the show looks too '70s in its premise, too Donny and Marie-ish in some parts and Sonny and Cher-in some others.  Lachey's performance with Babyface is nice. How come Babyface didn't produce Nick's entire solo album instead of the batch of people Nick went to that caused Soul-O to flop?  He would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to. But having Mr. T and Johnny Bench and Kenny Rogers makes the show look, sadly, too 1983-ish. How come they couldn't get somebody current to perform on it, say Maroon 5 or Kanye West, who were both hot last April? They wanted to bring back the variety show format, but it's very hard to do it in an Internet age.  And Jessica isn't all that good on this show. I'd rather hear her music and albums instead. They need to bring new things to the format if they're going to make another show. For now, Lachey and Simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this! 
 I purchased this table from another vendor--the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off.  It also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support.  The table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top.  I promptly returned this table 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 1 star is for the DVD, 5 stars for the movie.  I don't need to say anything about the film; those familiar with Bava's work know this is among his masterpieces.  I'm writing this review to clear up some things about this new "Unslashed" edition.  On the positive side, this version is Anamorphic widescreen and it does present noticeably more picture information on the right and left sides of the frame (the old VCI version was leterboxed a 1.66:1, where as this one is 16 x 9). Now the bad news.  The color and contrast have been boosted/altered to the point that the image appears blurrier, grainier and more damaged than the previous version.  Also, the interior sets (especially in the fashion house) have a putrid yellow/green hue to them not present in the old version.  The soundtrack is horribly remixed, making the dialogue sound like it was recorded in a tin can and it pops quite a bit through the opening of the film.  The French and Italian audio channels are reversed.  None of these audio problems are present on the old version by the way.  To top it off, the dvd menus are gaudy and offputting, trying to make this seem like a bloody slasher pic.  In summution, the extra picture information just doesn't outweigh all of the drawbacks of this edition.  My advice is to hold on to your old release until something better comes along.  Thanks for reading.  -JWH 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 What a morass of conflicting data!  First it's this much soy, then that much.  Then the 100 year olds are still in their prime because of an oil that was only invented in Canada 20 years ago.    What a sorry state that this book could even get printed much less reach popular status.  Kaayla Daniel, author of THE WHOLE SOY STORY  has written an excellent summary of the problems with this book here on Amazon as well as of THE CHINA STUDY, another sorry attempt to push a dietary agenda by "cooking statistics." While it's certainly good to eat your vegetables, be cautious about switching to a high soy diet based on pseudo scientific claims.      
 I love Laura Mercier's skin products, but her makeup line has these dark, cherry-burnt-orange-rasberry colors that just don't work for fair skin or  blonde hair (which I have.) I wish her colors were better, there was only 1 eye color I could wear in this kit, and the 3 glow stick things were confusing, because they weren't sticks.  
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 I recently purchased an explorist 600.  I have called customer service for advice on upgrading, adding maps, etc on this unit.  Their customer service is very unresponsive, to the point that they are almost rude.  I have spent over two hours on hold for them, to finally get an agent that speaks limited English.  I have emailed them, asking an english speaking representative to call me to no avail.  They don't seem responsive, are almost scornful to the average person with limited GPS capability.  I'm forced to return 
 after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement.  of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it. 
 This soundtrack is deceptive.  I agree with those who suggested soundbytes and including the proper tracks.  Buy the other soundtrack.  All Newman, all the time.  Fabulous, haunting stuff.  The real name of 'Teenage Wasteland' by the way, is Baba O'Reilly.  I once won Who tickets because I knew the proper title for this song, so it stuck 
 I love Mae West but this book bombed.  It is informative but so much that it's boring.  I never finished it.  It has some great photos and if you're doing a term paper on her it's wonderful 
 I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time. 
 This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.    Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time. 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Dissecting the Holocaust is just a new spin on anti-Semitism.  What's next, denying slavery in America, denying the Red Sox won the series in 2004.  Some call this a scholarly work, it is not scholarly, rather phony intellectualism, which is a pure lie 
 I'm not going to waste much time on this book review except to say that of all the books I've read on this disorder this one is the worst.  This guy comes across as a total jerk and I think this book is a fake. I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.  If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan 
 My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one 
 Based on this, I had high hopes for the iSee 360i and was perhaps one of the first ones to get this item and try it out.  I may be the ONLY one so far, because as of this date I couldn't find a single other mainstream review.  Now I may know why: it's a complete dud.  I could not get it to work in the slightest with my 60GB video iPOD.  Depending on the iPOD you have, there are adapters that must be ordered seperately, because quite  unbelieveably, they are not included.  To add further insult to injury, the instructions are vague and did not make clear (at least to me) which iPOD should be used with this unit without having to order adapters.  Needelessly to say, I returned it almost immediately. I would defintely say that the iSee is not ready for Prime Time! 
 Normally I don't review content on DVDs just execution ....this product suffers on both counts.  The true story of BABE RUTH is a legendary one...and this movie pays little attention to much of it.  With all the amazing athletic feats to deal with this movie mostly takes the personal route and gets pretty redundant with it...how many belches do we need to hear or meals do we need to see consumed at record pace? Goodman could have played Ruth...but he'd have needed to drop some weight...lots of it.  Ruth was a great athlete and while his weight fluctuated he was never the blob that Goodman is.  I remember seeing this movie when it first played in theatres and until I actually saw real footage of Ruth and learned the true story years later did I realize what a travesty this "movie of the week" type project is.... BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD?  the two bonus featurettes starring the real BABE RUTH as bonus features...they alone are worth the ten bucks 
 This book was good in that it has some interesting ideas about the future, mortality and aging. This might have made it recommendable.  But the story didn't have any meat on it. It was actually pretty boring and ultimately a disappointment. And for this, it's not really recommendable 
 This seemed like a great set for our kids but the water leaked out and the animals no longer appear to float 
 Very disappointing, It's just old recordings rehashed onto a new CD and I heard that LeAnn who is a wonderful singer didn't even have any say about this CD being released! Also there aren't enough patriotic songs! I really hope that LeAnn makes a new CD of all newly recorded Patriotic songs and another one that is all Inspirational Gospel songs 
 I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings.  I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study.  Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself).  I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  I've been disappointed.  I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information.  I was between this one and the Carson commentary.  Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.  (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for. 
 My daughter received this as a gift when she turned five. Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend an hour putting it together and figuring out how to play it. And while you're doing that, your child(ren) will be whining about it taking so long. I was doing okay until it came time to put the two stickers on the spinning wheel. The directions for this part were incredibly confusing, and the directions for how to play the game were about the same. I also couldn't believe that I had to put stickers on the die (first time for everything!). That said, once we FINALLY figured it all out, my daughter loves it. I think it's the "secret" aspect of the game she enjoys -- pick three things out of the box without peeking and look for your match to your princess w/o showing anyone else the card to win the game. Still, I had to rate this 2 stars for the poor construction of the game 
 Standout Tracks: 25 TO LIFE, WESTSIDE, F--K WHERE YOU FROM, DO YA THING, IM A KING, LIKE A MOVIE, MESS IT UP and #1 CREW. Filler: Walk this way(Worst girlie record ever made!), Lookin shife(WTF is shife?), Still I love her(Even with T.I this record still sucks), Coming down(this song is DEAD R.I.P.), Touch Something(nice beat weak record)Murder Game (T.I killed it though)and Set it Off(weak first single). Bottom Line: we already know that T.I is a great lyricist but even he cant hold up a GROUP album such as this. Mac Boney once in a blue moon will bust a decent rhyme but Young Dro and the rest of them forget about it! Surprisingly though they have two song without T.I that is good(25 to life and #1 crew) but they also have songs with T.I that suck(touch something, Still I love her , Set it out and Murder Game). T.I had the only good verse in Murder game causing it to be labled as filler. Even if you are a T.I fan I strongly recommend you to think before you buy this one 
 The person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened. I found this cookbook useful only if I changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half, and doubling the amount of sugar.  My daughter didn't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book. They were disgusting! They weren't at all sweet and extremely fatty. Yuck!  I use the corn bread recipe all the time, it's excellent if you know what needs to be changed. Do not add any butter at all (the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons), and add 3/4 cup of sugar (the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon). 
 This is a useless product.  I do not exercise much, and I do not even get a burn from this machine.  The DVD is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone.  It looks like it is low budget!  
 This is a fascinating concept, and a marketable one as well, in light of America's current infatuation with the Edifice Complex.  Considering the author's scholarly credentials, SEX AND REAL ESTATE should have been a absorbing book.  "Should have" is the pivotal phrase here.  No question that Garber's body of knowledge is vast--she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis.  Maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader.  While I have no doubt but that this fact is true, the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble.  Anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed 
 I found this book engaging and entertaining, however was led to believe by the promotional materials that it would be a bit denser with information.  If one edited out the personal anecdotes, endless references by the author to her own credentials (yes, yes, you have an advanced degree as does a substantial percentage of the population, please on to the information now) and "chimpanzees lite," the book would be a leaner (50+ pages maybe) read rather than the slightly bloated tome it currently is.  Perhaps this is the publisher's fault.  Read it for the insightful and charming stories of the author's own well loved pooches.  For information on primatology, go to the horses' mouths (primatologists - many fine accessible books available).  For information on dog behavior, perhaps there is more out there 
 I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. Just because Dawn left the BSC for California in #88 doesn't mean you can replace Dawn with some girl with asthma named Abby Stevenson. If you are a big Dawn Schafer fan, but you still want to keep on reading the Baby-sitters Club books, read #98 or #99. Those books have Dawn in them. I LIKE DAWN BETTER THAN ABBY 
 Titan A.E. should have been an epic movie full of thought provoking ideas. With talents like the legendary Don Bluth on animation, skilled sci-fi screenwriters like Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) writing the screenplay and stars like Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman and Nathan Lane doing voice over work and a [...]dollar budget the movie had all the elements of a hit. Unfortunately all these talented individuals failed to become successful when brought together on this project. Titan A.E. is an uninspired mess of a movie with a predictable story, dated looking animation, flat acting and primitive looking CGI. Thanks in part to the box office failure of this movie and several others like Treasure Planet and Atlantis, hand drawn animated movies are currently not being produced by American movie studios. A shame because there are so many great stories to tell using this art form.  Titan A.E. follows the story of Cale, a young boy in the year 3028 or something. Cale's father has built a spaceship The Titan, which can recreate an Earth like planet when activated. Big blue off the shelf computer generated aliens known as The Drej find out about the Titan and go to Earth to destroy it. During a final onslaught on the planet, Cale's father gives his son to an alien to care for along with a ring then gets on another ship. The Titan escapes along with a few million human survivors. Five-year-old Cale helplessly watches as the Drej blow up Earth and kill his father. So bleak, so boring so predictable.  Cut to fifteen years later. Cale a young man now, is working a crummy job at a space station. True to formula, he's angry and disillusioned drifting through life with no direction. After an unappetizing lunch of living creatures, Cale runs afoul of some human hating aliens. He's about to get pummeled when he conveniently he runs into Korso, a man who says he's been searching the galaxy for fifteen years for him on his quest to find the Titan. He activates a code in Cale's ring and conveniently the Drej head to the station to kill him. It would have been helpful to give the bad guys some character development here. I find it odd how the Drej found Cale at the same time as Korso but not for the past fifteen years despite being smart enough to blow up a planet. Cale and Korso shoot it out with the Drej to escape the space station, but the bug like cook who served lunch is a casualty of the assault. They hotwire a spaceship which gets damaged as it leaves the station and make a thrilling jump into space without spacesuits. Too bad this makes no sense scientifically. Their bodies would have exploded from the pressure before they asphyxiated.  The movie goes on in spite of this minor plothole. On board Korso's ship Cale meets the attractive Akima, who looks both hot and edgy along with other members of Korso's alien crew. The quest for the Titan begins and the slowly paced movie starts to get even slooower, changing into a ninety minute long chase where we watch Cale and Akima start a lukewarm romance, shooting, arguing between Cale and the crew, arguing between Cale and Akima, arguing between Cale and Korso, two brief scenes where nudity is teased, and just more arguing and shooting leading to Predictable plot twist #1: Korso is working for the Drej and plans on destroying the Titan when they find it. True to formula, Korso gets a change of heart and sacrifices himself and Cale activates the Titan after learning predictable plot twist #2: Drej are beings of pure energy and they would power the Titan when it recreates the Earth like planet. Cale figures this out in record time and recreates the planet calling it "Bob". The movie ends and I shed a tear as I watch an opportunity to make something truly innovative in the Science Fiction genre wasted by a bunch of people who have the talent to do much better. Titan A.E. fails as a science fiction movie because of a poorly written script that has the plot and character development of a bad 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. Edlund and Whedon's weak screenplay plays everything safe and takes no risks in telling Cale's story. Movies in the Science Fiction genre always take risks exploring the worlds they inhabit and exploring the personalities of the characters who live in the universe. There was a story to tell here, but the writers focused on the wrong characters and the wrong plot points. The real story should have been with Cale's father not Cale. I wanted to know why he made the Titan and why was there a need to create a new Earth like planet. Could Earth have been overpopulated and scientists felt they needed a new world was the solution to handle the masses? Did the energy based Drej fear Earthmen exploiting their race as power source for the Titan? Perhaps Drej spies read about slavery in ancient American history texts and colonization of foreign lands during the colonial period and felt the need for a pre-emptive strike. These were deeper reasons for an intergalactic planet destroying war and should have been the focus of the movie's overall plot. Production wise, Titan A.E. is subpar. Bluth's hand-drawn animation for Fox looks horribly outdated when put side to side with the work of other animators at the competing animated studios of Disney, DreamWorks and Warner Brothers in the same year. Bluth's backgrounds are often too dark and character movements over exaggerated. Bluth, true to his style over the past thirty years focuses too much on wide shots of flailing of limbs to express character emotion and not on close-ups of facial expressions to tell his story. Watch any of Bluth's Disney films (Robin Hood, The Fox and the Hound) or his 90's Fox films (Anastasia, The Land Before Time, An American Tail) to see how little his style has changed with the times. The CGI has no detail and doesn't blend into the backgrounds smoothly. The Drej and their ships look like they belong in another film not here in Titan A.E. Compare the animation in Titan A.E. to DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado released that same year. Road does everything Titan A.E wanted to do from a technical standpoint blending CGI and animation beautifully. Brad Birds' work on Warner's Iron Giant features a well-written story and is a brighter film with lively human characters and beautiful backgrounds. Disney's later efforts like Kim Possible and Lilo and Stitch have more engaging characters and utilize unique animated character designs. Titan A.E. with its looks and feels like a 1980's movie not a 2000 theatrical release.  Fox was setting up Titan A.E. to be a sci-fi classic that pushed the genre of hand-drawn animated films into the adult themed direction of Japanese Manga. Ironically, the failure of these "riskier" hand-drawn animated movies like Fox's Titan, A.E., DreamWorks Road to El Dorado, Warner's The Iron Giant, Disney's Treasure Planet and Atlantis halted the production of hand-drawn animated films in America for the time being. Because American studios and audiences continue to see hand-drawn animated films as children's fare filmmakers cannot push the envelope and tell the adult themed stories of their Japanese counterparts. Until American movie studios and audiences change their perceptions about hand-drawn animation, filmmakers will never be able to make hand-drawn animated movies with mature themes and expand the audience for the art form past small children. Pass this one by at the video store. Adults looking for an adult themed animated movie should Pick up the far superior Heavy Metal or Castle of Cogliostro and preteens looking for a non-Disney animated film can pick up the superior Road to El Dorado, The Iron Giant or The Prince of Egypt. 
 After reading Dutch by Teri Woods, I assumed all of her books would be great. This was a serious mistake on my part...It was totally horrible. The plots and the situations that took place were totally unbelievable. There were times when I literally was ready to throw the book out but I am one to read through the entire novel to give it a chance. I was disappointed in the author for this one. I wasn't sure if this was just a little something to pass the time before Dutch III came out but I personally feel like it should never have been written. The crazy thing is part two reads a little better, but not much. If you are thinking of buying thi sbook, save your money..Trust me.. 
 It is soft and feels sooooo good!!! BUT the Burgundy sheeds like a cat it is all over the floor, my hair, the red fur is every were!!! I only get one pillow cast and one sheet like  thing !!! I have 2(two) pillows please! in the photo it looks like two of every thing!! Help me here!!  where is the other one? 
 The poins touched by this book are good, however, I bought this book due to I use on class. Since 2nd. edition I found a lot of errors on the result pages as well some unclear steps on the text. I wrote to the author and he just say: "sent me the errors to correct them"...should I be co-author of this book or what?? If you're going to buy it, make a second tought 
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 When I first received the items they didn't work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still don't work.  I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldn't even get them to work.  I sent them a e-mail to receive my money back, because I didn't want to keep spending money to send items back that don't work back.  Who would have guessed, but they never replied.  Thanks for waisting my time and money.  I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware 
 From a sociological perspective, Hustlers, Beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the sociological aspects of billiards in America and the culture that has accompained it through time. However with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. Te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . Is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.As a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. All in all, quite disapointing as I found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting. I was left with a feeling of  disappointment when I finished this book, as it completely crushed many of  the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture  of billiards. Stick with the sociology, cut the editoria 
 This is a children's book written by Lance Armstrong's first wife.  I did not know this when I bought it for my adult son.  My fault--I should have done more research 
 I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!! It had it's moments so, 2 stars.  Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'.  Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it). 
 This book is a horrific let down.  While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this.  I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student.  Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious.  While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old.  the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial.  The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across.  It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book.  Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book.  No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment.  This was painful to read 
 i'm not exactly sure why i bought this book.  something about the blurb and first couple paragraphs caught my eye... not to mention the vintage photo on the cover.  but, ultimately, i'm disappointed.  the story plays out in the first 75 pages and consequently drags through another 225 until it finally ends in glazed-over, lamely symbolic scene that involves a doe serenely staring down the main character across the snow-covered Vermont campus.  The authors use of question marks in her younger characters' dialog was mildly amusing the first time, but quickly grew old with over use.  And she had lots adjectives that didn't add anything but ambiguity to otherwise clear and concise descriptions.  I'd like to get her address and mail her this horrible failure of a novel... so I don't have to look at it on my bookshelf and be reminded of the time i wasted reading it.   i give it two stars only because it kept my disgusted attention...  just like a multiple car crash on the highway 
 I thought I could save money by printing some photos on this less expensive matte photo paper.  Big mistake.  Quality is so poor that   I'm ready to just dump it.  Can't figure what else to use it for. 
 Typical left wing "vast right wing conspiracy" nonsense.  Only the most paranoid Americans looking through the peepholes of triple locked  doors would recognize the place this book is about and apparently from  where it was written 
 After browsing through this book and realizing many of the things Jack was saying couldn't be backed up with scripture, I decided to do some research on him.  Please, Please, Please, do a simple search on yahoo.com under his name.  You will read countless reports of how the gospel he is teaching is far different from the gospel of Christ.  He uses his time at Dallas Theological Seminary to boost his credibility, but they have acknowledged his time there was long before he got into a cult movement.  Please be very weary... 
 I was disappointed in this text because it offers more about the lives of those researching the flood as myth and science than it does about the myth, history, archaeology, and science of the flood itself.  It's digressions, mini-bios, anecdote, and superficial analyses were tedious obfuscations.  This could have been a facinating work but turned into another waste of time.  This reader was very dissatisfied with this work.  
 "Island of the Blue Dolphins" is a wonderfully-written book, and it's a good idea for a movie. Well, this adaption I was less than pleased with. The acting was terrible, and the special effects were cheaply done. I hope there is another movie made; the book deserves better 
 Without playing too much to the author's obvious biases, I can only say he has wrought a finely detailed purse from a sow's ear. But it still remains a sow's ear.   Lieven is anti-American. But, for what good reason? Really none. He has a cultural/historical grudge and axe to grind as he projects much of his own country's history on its long departed sibling, America. This grudge has, of course, been held because America has done so very well without the English. If anyone has an imperialist attitude, it is Lieven and his countrymen. The English have characterized Americans as rude, coarse savages, as were the Australians -- the latter perhaps the preeminent example of land clearing for the imperial cause, if there ever were one. One need only speak to the English about President George W. Bush, and it becomes clear they believe him to be a stupid cowboy in the most stereotypical way.   While Lievan poses Americans as Jacksonian oppressors clearing the land of savages, it has historically been the British who have colonized and exploited so-called savage lands they could rape for England's gain. This cannot be entirely said for America, except with respect for the American Indian and African slave.   Clearly, the English colonists were in America to exploit the lands and peoples. But for many other settlers the former problem was, arguably, not so much the conquering of distant lands for personal gain as it was one of ineptitude. Many American settlers did not foresee the hostility of indigenous peoples. Faced with the proposition of life and death, settlers felt compelled to defend their property -- even more, to defend the land that stood breach between sustenance and starvation. Slavery cannot be so explained.  Contrary to Lieven's oversimplified thesis, America has been host to the many masses of people's from distant lands. Rather than clear its land of savages, some observors would surely say America has filled its land with such so-called savages. Indeed, the melting pot never was and never will be. In that respect America is more like France in that through its benificence the door has been opened to a host of problems.   The question now is how America will deal with rapidly encroaching Islamists and Islam itself, the breeding ground from which such extremists spring. The same cannot be said for Christianity. While Islam promotes offensive warfare and the capturing of slaves, Christianity promotes peace and the sane acceptance of one's plight, should it be as slave.   France dealt with the Muslims with a light hand and is now a nation filled with fuming Islamic discontents rioting in the streets and burning thousands upon thousands of vehicles, damaging private property and otherwise undermining the rule of law. One might ask, "Are they savages?" Well, not neccessarilly so. But many hold values that are destructive to the very fabric of a nation. We can trace such failures back to, at least, Algeria. Should America allow itself to become another France? We have opened the floodgates. How should we close them 
 First, as always, the disclaimer. I am a regional author (Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh; ISBN 0972005064) and, like all authors, prone to fighting fits of envy. So, take what I am about to write with a grain of salt. I loved "Cold Mountain". Loved the premise,the historical truth, the characters, the setting, and the writing. I looked forward to the much hyped second effort by Mr. Frazier. The good news is that his writing is still exemplary. By that, I mean the man certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But that's about all I can say, in terms of positives, about this effort. The plot seems overblown and quite frankly, totally preposterous. The main character, Will, is thrown into wars, and disasters, and inclement weather, and every other kind of malady, only to survive, essentially unchanged and unscathed, while all those around him fall or fail. His ability to amass a fortune and hundreds of thousands of acres of land seems, given his humble beginnings, to strain even my vivid imagination. The descriptions of the landscape are lovely but lost in a plot that has no point. The first quarter of the book, the beginnings of a love affair between Will and Claire, the love of Will's life, has promise. Then, for the greater part of half of the novel, we are immersed endlessly in tedium surrounding Will and his adopted Indian tribe, the only point of which seems is to convince us that Will's greed isn't selfish, but done for the good his Red Brothers and Sisters. Far too late, and in a strained and surrealistic manner, the story comes back to Will and Claire. But by then, my patience was worn thin and the return to the real story, the interpersonal struggle between the lovers, had lost its appeal. Two stars might be a little light but that's how I see it.  
 The general content in the area of how-to was ok, but with so much reference to open reel tapes and minimal to digital recording made it disapointing.  Copyright dated 1988, 1994, the changes not covered that have taken place in the last five years are amazing.  The pointers on mic-ing are good, along with ideas on getting cleaner recorded tracks.  I am getting a lot more out of "Home Recording Power!" by Ben Milstead.  It is slanted toward the CakeWalk Sonar software, but gets things moving fast!  The sugestions are current as well 
 I purchased the above product in 2006.  I opened the package and used them in 2007.  After they were washed twice I found that it was virtually impossible to get them to fit on the bed.  They shrunk so much!  I have regular king size pillows and cannot even get the cases on the pillow.  I tried to return these, but was told that I purchase them too long ago, and I could only get 50% back and I would have to pay for the shipping.  I think the company should stand behind this product.  I have much less expensive sheet sets and this did not happen to them.  DO NOT BUY, NO WORTH THE MONEY 
 Review no.618.Somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'Load' CD, which was one of their better works ever,I thought. I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are "The Memory Remains" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),"The Unforgiven II",the melodic "Where The Wild Things Are" and "Bad Seed". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title 
 I was expecting more out of a plot that was set in the sleazy world of strippers and prostitution but this book was so superficial in its usage of this plot device that it would have been better to have chosen something different. The two protagonists are also not well-drawn though the heroine fared better than Hank, the hero. All throughout the book, he came across as boring and conservative - which did not gel with the author's description of him as an ex-Ranger AND a psychic. I mean, wow - as an ex-Ranger, Hank would have some back story but nothing is said about him. I didn't know what he was like, what events in his life shaped him into the man he is today, who his friends were and what drives him;  His whole character is made up of a guy who operates a martial arts school after being an ex-Ranger. He was like an inanimate object in the book at worst and at best, a Labrador seeing-eye dog. At least Jess had some emotional aspect to her but not much either. The annoying thing is that both the plot and the characters had so much potential.  For a much more satisfying police procedural, Karen Rose is much better bet because you'll get great romance and great characterisation. I haveLisle's I See You but after LGD, I did not feel like another Lisle 
 I just want to associate myself with the review by S. Berner. I couldn't believe how boring the whole thing was 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 In his Authentic Buffalo Hot Sauce recipe he says to use Tobasco. He either has stock in Tabasco sauce or honestly doesn't know what's in real Buffalo Wing sauce. A lot of rub recipes and sauce recipes that are good, but how can he make that mistake? Tabasco 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 I agree with Jodi (see her review further down) -- Teitelbaum is confused into thinking that the chronic fatigue he experienced as an overworked medical student is the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  True CFS (which involves neurologic, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other abnormalities, not merely extreme fatigue) has far more symptoms than just fatigue.  It's generally a result of a virus, not "burn out".  For those who have real CFS, some of the advice can be hazardous. Experts concur that exercise is detrimental, especially to those in the advanced stages who have viral damage to their heart muscle ... I know several patients who've been rendered permanently bedridden after following misguided advice to exercise their way to health.  In fact, reaction to exercise is one of the ways the experts differentiate between CFS and depression.  (see www.cfsfacts.org for details on this diagnostic shortcut)  I've tried Teitelbaum's Fatigued to Fantastic formula; even at maximum dosage, it didn't put me to sleep.  It might help if you have chronic fatigue (the symptom) from insufficient sleep, but Chronic Fatigue SYNDROME is not sleeping too little, but not feeling refreshed when you wake up even if you've slept 20 hours.  See Jodi's list of good books about the Syndrome (not the symptom); I'd add David S. Bell's "Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" as one of my top picks 
 I found Henry F. Pringle's biography on Theodore Roosevelt to be bit overrated. Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.   I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.  I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then. But reading it now after going through many of the modern materials on Roosevelt, make Pringle's work looked weak and stale.   Not really recommended for anyone unless your curiousity get aroused by ancient work 
 I found the book very confusing.  The author leaps from past pirate adventures to modern day Jimmy Buffett and back.  I have had this book for over a year and have not been able to get past page 50.  When Jimmy urges  Mr. Eng not to continue the book, I think it was more for the reader's sake  and not for his own.  Fins Up 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 I ordered the Pogo Roo Pogo Stick on Dec. 6, 2006 and I am still waiting for it to be shipped.  They just bumped it back another month to mid May for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock.  Best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months!  Very poor service 
 I read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway. I was stupid.  I had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months.  That one is great and has held up after multiple washings.  It is still so soft.  So I just didn't belive the two bad reviews.  I WAS WRONG.  The bad reviews are correct.  I took these new 9 out of the box yesterday.   They are not of the same quality of the one I already have.  They are packed at least 3 different ways.  I think maybe some of them are someone else's defective returns.    I don't think these are first quality.  There are MANY snags.  There is at least one blue stain.  One looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily. The quality of the construction is not good.  Some are soft, some are rough.  I returned all 9.  DO NOT BUY 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 Trendy revisionist garbage as to be expected from the Yale imprimature. This edition is strictly for collegial faculty club bores. Get the edition edited by Stefan Collini instead he's less interested in himself 
 I won't get into a political discussion, although I disagree strongly with his beliefs.  Nevertheless, one thing about this book that agitated me was the complete lack of sources.  For example, Horowitz claims that shortly before his death, Huey Newton stated he shot John Frey in an interview to strike back at the white establishment.  Fair enough - but if you want to find the interview, Horowitz isn't going to give you any information whatsoever as to the location of it.  The same holds true for a similar claim that Jerry Rubin admitted that he deliberately stirred up trouble at the DNC in '68 to provoke a riot.  Fine.  Where can we find this interview?  Well, we can't, at least not according to Horowitz's book.  How am I supposed to respect a man who violates a cardinal rule of journalism (I am aware that this is a biography; that doesn't invalidate the fact that sources should be cited when necessary)?  Is he merely forgetful or are the interviews he cites non-existant or, under scrutiny, do they simply fail to uphold the claims he makes 
 I wish I read the bad review before I bought this. I may return it, but it  took me more than an hour to peel the sticker and cut myself in the  process. I have never seen something stuck like that before. I got four  items from Amazon this time, and the fact that they keep such an item in  stock make me wonder. I haven't had enough experience with it but look like  someone else had. And it is not good. Also it is a very simple utensil and  sells for a good amount so you expect a good one. All what it takes is one  bad experience for me and I don't buy again from the same site 
 I thought When the Wind Blows was ok, it was readable and enjoyable, but not a book a would list as a favorite. I recently went away for a long weekend and took this book with me, as his chapters are short and his books are usually something hard to put down. Well, I found this book to be horrible! The plot line was ok, but there seemed to be chapters missing, or huge wholes in the storyline. Maybe it was just an editing disaster, maybe there was more written in the original draft.....but whatever the case, the finished book was a huge disappointment to a long time James Patterson fan.  The beginning seemed to drag, but then the story seemed rushed once it finally started to pick up....only to seem like the ending was rushed just to get the book to the publisher or something.  I think from now on I will stick with the Alex Cross and Women's Murder Club books...they have yet to disappoint me 
 I'm sorry to say that after a month-long travel through the Dominican Republic, I have to agree with the previous negative reviewer, in that the book is full of inaccuracies and it seems obvious that the author didn't  travel to many of the places he writes about. Also, the book seems to  derive an awful lot of its material from another book on the Dominican  Republic called Adventure Guide. Also, the author seemed overly scared of  remote areas, especially around Haiti. It's more a book for older folk who  are into golf courses and cigars, not for someone who wants to experience  the country and really wander around and meet people. I usually do like the  Moon series, though. Don't let this book dissuade you from the usually very  competent Moon books 
 The music on this CD sounds fantastic, but BE AWARE that they are only short segments of the hymns. For example, I specifically bought the CD for "Be Thou My Vision", which is actually only a short instrumental, and "Crown Him With Many Crowns", which only had one verse. Not good for a rousing sing-along while you do the dishes 
 this is a boring book that gives some insight into the period.  Most of it is filled with uninteresting dialogue that gives very little insight into anything.  You have to skip through to find historical interest. 
 This was my first Barbara Taylor Bradford book to read.  I've heard great things about her books, but this one is very disappointing.  I'm over half way through the book, but I don't think I will be able to finish it.  There are so many characters that I can't keep up with who's who!  Also her writing seems more like "filler" than actual fiction.  I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to anyone 
 works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips, wouldnt buy it again. 
 If the author's misuse of the apostrophe in the title is any indication of how they wrote the rest of the book, I would stay away 
 I purchased this case to store my DVDs along with the inner and outer liner notes.  Unfortunately, the sleeves are only large enough to hold in the inner notes.  Since most of my DVDs only had the outer liner notes, this case was pretty useless.  In general, the design of the product left much to be desired.  If by "XTREME" it means big and bulky, then the description is right on 
 I have enjoyed reading true crime for some time now including Whoever Fights Monsters, But this book is self serving and does not introduce any new information you have not already read.  It seems Mr. Ressler is angry at John Douglas and others for not aknowledging his effort while an active profiler and he is trying to show them he was first or best or something.  The message was lost on me.  The interviews are something to read however the bulk of the book is simply a retread of his previous works.  My advice.  Skip it 
 These are definitely not my thing.  The chocolate and toffee flavor is WAY too strong; if I'd have wanted hot cocoa I would have ordered it!  However, if you're a big fan of gas-station cappuccinos - these may appeal to you 
 This isn't what I thought it would be.  The instructions are unclear, so I had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it.  I finally figured it out after about 10 minutes of fiddling with it.  You have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands. That means that once you put gel on your face, you get gel on the machine. I set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm. This must be a safety thing, but I can't imagine what the lower settings are for.  The gel cools extremely fast, so by the time you apply it to your face, only the gel where you first apply it feels warm.  I had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better, but I don't use foam shaving creme anymore.  Once I use up this can of gel, the Hot Gel Machine gets retired.  
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the "Shadow Man".  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.  Eventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil.  As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  I've read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting.  It wasn't exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.  Finally, I realized I didn't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.  The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated..."Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing. 
 Grenz initially usurps postmodernity as a tool to echo the death of modernism.  It seems his primary purpose in this task is the conflict between modern thought and Christianity's feasibility.  Once he feels he's accomplished this he goes back and asks us to, in certain instances, ignore the triumph of the postmodern over the modern he's just outlined that we may embrace those few elements of modernity that may prove useful in allowing his yearning for Christian legitimacy to continue with the least amount of resistance.  Then he audaciously asks us to simultaneously ignore the nuances of postmodern thought that don't fit particularly well with Christianity.  If you are used to picking favorable parts out of texts to support your position and blatantly ignoring all points to the contrary, this book may be for you.  It appears that Grenz is adeptly applying the traditional Christian technique of selectively quoting Bible passages out of context without regard for the overall message to his analysis of the modern and postmodern.  Fortunately, we don't need to perform any act of deconstruction on this text as the deconstruction is always already inherent in the text 
 Yes, it is true. They made another Doctor Dolittle film without Eddie Murphy, but that is not the biggest problem about `Doctor Dolittle 3.' No, what is really annoying is the bad script of the film which does not know its target audience. I thought the greatest merit of `Doctor Dolittle' franchise is the comical interaction between a human and animals. However, the second sequel seems to have a different idea about it because the heroine of the film, the renowned Doctor's daughter Maya (Kyla Pratt, returning as the same role as she did in `DD' and `DD2') thinks that her ability of talking to an animal prevents her from being popular among the class, for it makes her look so uncool and weird.  Can you believe that? If you are a 17-year-old girl like Maya living somewhere in America, and you can truly understand what the animals are speaking, you WOULD be popular. But Maya, who is desperate to fit in, would not see things that way. Instead, I don't know why, but Maya's worried mom (Kristen Wilson, also doing the same role in `DD' and its sequel) thinks of sending her off to a cowboy camp, where Maya meets a group of kids, mostly stock characters from another teenage comedies.   In fact `DD3' looks like a usual Hollywood coming-of-age comedy, and some set-pieces involving Kyla Pratt's character may remind you of the episodes from, say, `Lizzie McGuire.' You know the typical plot elements such as the rivalry with another female, meeting a hunky boy, and a brief musical sequence, etc., and all these things are done in a most familiar way. Plus, you can enjoy some fart jokes, slapsticks (like throwing eggs), and, yes, don't forget talking animals. But if the animals are not the center of the film's story, what is the point of making another Doctor Dolittle film?  To her credit, Kyla Pratt does her best, but even her likable personality and natural charms cannot hide the weak script and the lack of originality. Twenty Century Fox, it is true, has polished up everything in the film, so the images are clear, the production designs are decent, and those animals act and speak naturally, but if you demand something more from the film, you will be hugely disappointed with it. 
 This could have been a good movie based on the subject matter.  But it was not reality based and the acting was poor 
 This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though. 
 Maybe I was expecting too much, but I wish I hadn't wasted my $$$ on this book.  The book is dry and contains nothing special.  The information written is pretty much common sense thinking. The author really doesn't tell us anything that most of us don't already know.  (Avoid "empty" calories from foods such as cakes, cookies, & candy and focus on getting your nutrition from healthier choices.)  Save your money, and instead refer to the web or your doctor for information regarding what to eat and how much while pregnant 
 So annoying to be told again and again how the British treat dogs better than the locals... and all the rest! Even complaining about the food he gets (for free). I would like one day to walk up to his house in Scotland, smelly and with a mangy dog, and see what kind of food I get 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs

 I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment 
 Why 2 stars instead of just 1?  Well, there are some interesting points and his style is entertaining at times.  Brian McLaren starts off with a number of questions...ok...probably more questions than necessary to "provoke" his readers into a response...or at least to get them to start thinking.  On page 4, I do like a question that indeed ought to be a recurring theme in the life of everyone who claims to be a Christian and that is:  "What if his [Jesus] secret message had practical implications for such issues as how you live your daily life, how you earn and spend money, how you treat people of other races and religions...?"  The question goes on of course, but I choose to focus on the first part of that question, and that is, what if the actual true Gospel message of Christ...not some "secret.," some esoteric hidden knowledge...was so important and so crucial to your understanding and outlook on life that you allowed it to sink down deep into your soul and change you, transform you into a new creature?    A bit later on page 4, McLaren also asks, "what if the message of Jesus was good news--not just for Christians but also for Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, new agers, agnostics, and atheists?"  Ah yes, it is good news for the world but alas the world does not receive Him.  1 John 5:10 (If we have faith in God's Son, we have believed what God has said. But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son, it is the same as calling God a liar.  Contemporary English Version-CEV).    In chapter 2, McLaren basically states that whatever he, you or I believe or understand, we can only perceive it, whatever the "it" is, through our own "interpretive grid."  So, is he saying that we cannot overcome our own bias?  That we can't know truth?  He regularly alludes to that "fact" in this book.  So somehow, there is truth, people can be on a journey or a quest to "uncover" the "truth," but if anyone claims or holds to the idea that the truth is knowable  must be insincere and lacking humility.  I'm sorry but, I don't buy it.  I think the author is biased to have such a view.    On page 39, McLaren states:  "In conversation after conversation, then, Jesus resists being clear or direct."  At the end of the next paragraph he continues this theme with:  "Frankly, few experts seem to even notice this pattern of unclarity, of hiddenness, of secrecy-and those who do tend to offer answers that don't ring true, for me anyway."  Jesus used a method of teaching that was very clear and direct to the hearers.  He spoke using stories that people could easily relate to and identify with; he spoke in colorful, vivid language that provoked thought.  Jesus isn't "hiding" anything.  As God incarnate, Jesus uses story and what Brian McLaren identifies as "hidden" messages to provoke his audience into thinking for themselves, to come to an understanding of who He is.  As a matter of fact, there are times where, although Jesus uses a parable or metaphor, the message is very clear indeed.  Think about how Jesus told his disciples that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven.    On page 51, the reader will stumble across perhaps a bit of McLaren's philosophical (postmodern) outlook in that our current/ present reality is constructed, that our worldview is a set of beliefs, images, metaphors, ideas etc. that "we inherit and construct."  He states that "As we go through life, many of us find it next to impossible even to want to question our inherited worldview, while others do exactly that: we sometimes experience radical conversions out of one worldview into another."  So, anyone who would like to disagree with such a statement would be a person NOT willing to question their view?  Or is it only applied to those who disagree with such a statement of truth?  Indeed, we all ought to experience a radical conversion from one worldview to another and that is the conversion from the philosophies and ideas of this world, into the mind of Christ through His work on the cross at Calvary.    The first 2 paragraphs on page 52 are basically a complaint against modernism (of which there are valid issues and concerns with modernism), however, in this, McLaren argues that we in the "Modern West" are stuck, trapped if you will, in 17th Century thought patterns.    On page 65, I am sure that it is not the author's intent (or at least I pray it is not his intent) to imply that Jesus' rebuke of Peter with "Get behind me, Satan" is due to Peter having revealed Jesus' "secret identity" as the Christ.  Another troubling point arises on page 66 in his discussion of the Holy Spirit and the work of the Holy Spirit where McLaren states that "This kingdom [the Kingdom of God] represents a counterforce, a countermovement, a counterkingdom..."  Stop there for a moment; did McLaren just say that God and the Evil One balance one another? They cancel each other out?  Is this the Star Wars version of God's truth?  He is pretty repetitive in his writing...he does say that God's Kingdom has an evil counterpart.  He also refers to the Holy Spirit as a "new force."    McLaren frequently draws on material from Dallas Willard and other modern mystics. While there is beauty and mystery in the Christian faith, modern mystics such as Willard, are reintroducing (or perhaps just repopularizing) gnosticm into our churches.    Every once in a while a moment of clarity, a moment of truth, actually rings forth and one such nugget is found on page 84 with his discussion of what kind of a job the "shepherds" or pastors have done: "We may have instructed them [the people in their care] how to be a good Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, or Methodist on Sunday, but we didn't train, challenge, and inspire them to live out the Kingdom of God in their jobs, neighborhoods, families, schools, societies between Sundays."  That is a true statement in a lot of our churches, however, it is not the case in ALL churches.  Part of the problem, in my humble opinion, is a lack of focus and emphasis on sound teaching, verse-by-verse, from the pulpits.   McLaren does attempt to lay out some practical advice as to how one might go about putting their faith into Action on pages 86-87.  I am drawn to the story he shares also about Carter, the taxi driver in DC on page 89.    Another moment of clarity comes on page 109, where McLaren writes:  "If you say you believe his [Jesus] message, but you don't seek to practice ir, your faith is a matter of words only; it's not substantial, not real. Faith that counts then, is not the absence of doubt; it's the presence of action."  
 The current vogue in historical fiction has led to an influx of novels such as The Ruby Ring.  Their authors take truly fascinating and moving artifacts and stories (in this case, the apparent affair between Renaissance artist Raphael and baker's daughter Margherita Luti) and then use them as the basis for a novel.  In some cases (such as Philippa Gregory's various novels about English history and Emma Donoghue's Slammerkin and Life Mask) the results are fascinating and inspired.  In other cases, such as The Ruby Ring, the results are dishwater-dull recoutings of what might have happened if everyone in history acted like they were in a romance novel.  I will discuss the plot of this novel, so don't read further if for some reason you fear having this book spoiled for you.  One sure sign you're reading a stinker is if the heroine is immediately presented as a paragon of wit, beauty, bravery and intelligence even though she is a mere girl of humble means. Often a parent (usually the father, in this case the mother) has impressed upon our lass that she is very special and cut out for great things.  And typically she has some kind of unusual eye color, for some reason, though in this case there's an actual painting so the author must lump it with the classic brown hue.  In any case, here's how this love story of the ages goes.  Raphael needs a new model, he seems Margharita, he immediately falls in love, after some ridiculous dillydallying on her part when offered what must have been the equivalent of 10K, easy, to pose for Raphael (I believe to show her feisty independence, even though her family is impoverished, so her hesitation seems to make no sense), she poses, they hit it, they fall in love.   From this point henceforth, which occurs early on, the vast majority of dialog between the two consists of "I love you, bella."  "I love you, mi amor."  (Sex ensues.)  This does not vary over the course of the rest of the book.     There are other characters, of course, particuarly a cardinal obsessed about having Raphael marry his daughter (who is ugly and weird, unlike super!pretty!and smart! and just as noble as the nobility!  Margharita.)  Most of them are pretty interchangeable.  Often they admire Margharita and think she is wonderful, unless one of them wants to marry/do Margharita or Raphael (handy!)    There is also much coverage of the politics of art and artists, none of which will be particularly interesting to most people who has read anything about Renaissance Italy before.  It seemed to me that the author was powering through those parts so she could get to the next "mi amor" scene.   The writing is dull too.  The author has a tendency to inform the reader of things that one could clearly pick up from context.  "Oh, Raphael, you signed the nudie painting of me!"  "Yes, mi amor, I am signing it because I am proud that I painted you in the altogether and you are my lady!"  "Oh, my dearest love, but you rarely sign paintings!"  "Oh yes, but as you can see, I did in this instance!  Now let us off to the bedchamber!"    Bleah.   
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 For me, the LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock is of little value.  I talked with a friend living in Colorado who is very satisfied with an equivalent clock, but I am in New York and much further away from the transmitter and it just doesn't work to my satisfaction.  When it was first put on the wall in the kitchen and didn't work for several days, I contacted technical support.  They suggested I put the clock in a window.  I followed their suggestion and after 2 days the clock was set correctly.  I moved it back to the kitchen wall and now 7 days after the change to daylight savings it's still on eastern standard time.  I didn't purchase this clock to hang in my window.  I need a clock in the kitchen.  As soon as I can find a suitable replacement this one is going into the garbage where it belongs 
 The book had a torn page in it, but I really didn't like the book and would have kept it if not for the torn page. It had some recipes that were of interest, but overall didn't like the book.

 Unless you like ultra modern home designs, skip this book. The plans are impractical, especially with respect to kitchen layouts. Most of the homes have no vestibules in their entrances, which are a neccessity in colder climates 
 This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate  to say it, but if you "dummy down" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 Although the novel had piked my interest with the opening chapter, and is a definite entertaining read for a lazy Sunday afternoon, I have too say the novel is quite one-dimensional.  Disregarding the improbability of the occurrences (besides all novels hope to add to our imaginations), the characters were grossly underdeveloped, with each chapter rehashing the same side of every persona, but in a different situation.  There were few if any metaphors to develop depth to the story.  However, several typical Indian sterotypes were displayed (although commonly addressed in many East-West books).  Given that the story was written in first person through the eyes of Priya, her thoughts and observations seemed to be as simple-minded as the character herself.  Overall a fun, light hearted read, with one dimensional characters and a one dimensional storyline, very much so like a typical Bollywood movie.  Recommend it if you'd like a story spoon fed to you. 
  This the way Jacqueline Rose describes the relationship between a suicide bomber and the victum "unbearable intimacy shared in their final moments by the suicide bomber and her or his victims. Suicide bombing is an act of passionate identification--you take the enemy with you in a deadly embrace." The difference between the west and the Islamofacsists is that we do not see the innocent as the enemy. To the suicide bomber innocent women and children are the enemy just as much as the soldiers. 
 The first album was great. But this one left me wanting more and expecting a lot better songs. I got to listen to the CD for free and have no desirer to buy it. The 10th. song was listed as a bonus track. Why would they want to release a CD with only 9 songs. The whole CD lasted around 40 mins. and is over before you know it. They could have done a better job and put some better songs on it. I was really looking for this to be the best one yet. Maybe next time.   This album is great for first timers that never listen to IL DIVO, but fans beware 
 due to a snafu with my computer, the first review i wrote for this book was lost.  i could have just given up, but i am determined to implore those of you considering adding this book to your library to please resist!  only because i had to choose a star rating did i give it a one star.  i would have chosen 0 star if given the choice.  though milton is obviously a talented writer and did much research for this project, she obviously has some kind of grudge against chaplin.  true, he unfortunately left a great deal to exploit with the scandals, both personal and political.  but what she so obviously neglected was his creative genius that earned him the title King of Comedy.  she emphasizes rumors as facts and takes it upon herself to tell us what chaplin was more than likely feeling or thinking about any particular subject, when there is no way she could assume.  for instance, in describing 'city lights,' a clear masterpiece, she completely distorts, in my opinion, the best movie ending EVER.  that look on the tramp's face as he looks at the girl he loves - his face so full of love, fear, hopefulness - it is unbelievably touching and beautiful, but milton insists that he is using it to manipulate his audience - hopeful he still has their devotion and fearing his hold on them has passed.  she portrays him to be an absolute monster.  clearly, he couldn't have been the easiest person to live with, but it gives her no right to drag him through the mud as she did.  i hate to think of the people out there just discovering the genius of charles chaplin - seeing her book and thinking it will be a good, truthful read.  start with the david robinson book, or jeffrey vance - they are much more honest and fair.  i keep my milton book only because i refuse to turn it over to a library or used book store to infect a future reader's mind.  
 I have never received any correspondence from this company.  They were supposed to send the service plan within 2-3 weeks after I received the television.  However, as I stated - I never received the plan! 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
  This book is a poor attempt. I've read pamphlets with more usable information in them. The section on Hewing is a joke, as is most all the rest of this book. Very few hints and techniques in this book, which was very disappointing. Lots of self pumping-up, not no real instruction detail. Stick to writing books about stone, Mr. McRaven and give the timber world a sigh of relief 
 There are detailed graphics, maps, and explanations of cultural issues not found in other guide books.  However, they exclude major attractions and maps and attractions can be severely inaccurate.  It's good for preparing a trip, but it's too heavy and not helpful enough to bring with you 
 I am trying hard to finish this book...i have about 60 pages left and have been trying to finish them for a week now.  This is my first Jo Beverley and while I realize it probably isn't a good indication of th ewhole of her work, I cannot see myself reading another of her books anytime soon.  Glad I didn't pay for this 
 He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak.  All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful.  The self delusion in the book is amazing 
 This book is entirely misleading. Paul Johnson employs one of the dirtiest tricks known to humanity and very common in the political world - he picks a triple handful of intellectuals he doesn't like or disagrees with and digs up the darkest or absurdest material about them he can find.  I would have been a bit more impressed if he had chosen intellects or historical figures he revered and subjected them to the same dirty treatment.  Where are Mr. Johnson's favorite writers, popes, theologians, political philosophers and what all.  But it still would've been a mugs game and not worth much more beyond entertainment value except, perhaps, to affirm what all mature readers ought to know by now - we are all sinners.  Big deal.  Welcome to the real world, folks. Mr. Johnson does a singular disservice by his idiosyncratic use of the word "intellectual" by which he can push forward his smear campagain against intellectuals whose ideas bother him and white wash intellectuals he approves of. His treatment of Evelyn Waugh is absurd.  Mr. Waugh, contra Mr. Johnson, was most definitely an intellectual and he had his own ideas about how the world should be run.  Mr. Johnson does not take seriously Waugh's roster of sins which include an almost overbearing arrogance, the basic innability to admit when he was wrong, discourteousy to friend and foe alike, and a callous and ostentatious flaunting of wealth which would have won him the censure of the writer of the Epistle of James. I'll give Mr. Johnson's tabloid journalism two stars instead of one because it does have its entertainment value. Mere entertainment always has charm especially when wisdom is lacking 
 I really love Amanda Quick, but this one just didn't work. We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.  And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name "Jones" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!  All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library 
 couldnt get into this one , and i am a fan. disappointment 
 I highly recommend this item as a study in rhetoric and denial of science.  Mr. Bethell was recently on Book TV discussing his book and was truly entertaining 
 I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one.. 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book 
 HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!! 
  This film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes. It is as scientifically realistic as the Roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a Geico commercial.   Out of the hundreds of films that I have watched in my lifetime, of every stripe and quality, this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that I began fast-forwarding through simply so that I could see the meteor hit and make the big wave. If this film were a sexual encounter, both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay.  Life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film. 
 I'm not a big fan of Maddox. The beginning of the book is funny and got me interested to read more. I was disappointed to see the rest of the book to be predictable and boring, if not it would be just plain stupid 
 I purchased the audio version of the book. First, the reader, Agnes Herrmann, was terrible. Her reading was at times comicle when it wasn't supposed to be.  The content of the book was below average in my opinion. Again maybe it was just the way it was being read but I could not take it seriously and the content came across as being "Made Up" or "Fake"...just did not seem genuine to me.  I bought Gung Ho becasue of the overwhelming positive reviews about it. I was very dissapointed.  
 These are the type of books and garbage that let an actual  abuser get away with harrassing an ex-spouse and using a child as a pawn.  Doesn't anyone realize that this gives guilty people a loophole to pass the blame for the degradation of a parent child- relationship to someone else.  If your child doesn't like you, then you need to look inward at your own shortcomings and fix yourself, not look outward for someone to blame, just because admitting the truth is too difficult.  Maybe your child just doesn't like you...and maybe the child really has been abused. I've had about enough of all these fake syndromes.  I read this book and I am appalled.  No child who truly loves and admires a parent can be manipulated into "revisionist history" and being poisoned.  Society needs to give children more credit than that...and the authors of these "books" need to find something else to do.  Only a lemming would be so stupid as to follow this author's suggestion that parental alienation is possible simply by "telling" a child anything.  Children will continue to love and admire a parent who is worthy regardless of circumstances. If you've lost their love and affection you have only yourself to blame.  My ex tells my son terrible things about me all the time, and my son simply comes home and tells me what is said.  He follows that up with "I love you" and "I know the things that are said aren't nice".  It has not damaged my relationship with my son whatsoever, but my ex has lost the respect of this child.  Think about what is in this book, and then put it down and run...never to follow this kind of bunk again 
 although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty  without high resolution.  the tutorial has some merit for just beginning,  but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to  admit that i was lured into buying this book 
 Any album that lists the "Iowa Fight Song" followed by (Iowa State) can't be any good.  It's the University of Iowa Fight Song, not Iowa State University.  And from the preview I heard, they didn't do it justice anyway 
 I have read many serotonin-related books and I am quite confused. In his book "Beyond Prozac" Michael J. Norden, an eminent Psychiatrist, states that the much-publicized high-carbohydrate diet may actually make you depressed and overweight. In "Potatoes not Prozac" a  high-carb plus protein diet is advocated. Dr. Joel Robertson in his  "Natural Prozac" states that protein is a dopamine booster. Who  should one believe? What is true and what is not? Should one accept Dr.  Wurtman's approach as correct? O.K. she is an M.I.T. professor but the  other authors have impressive academic credentials as well 
 This book was mistakenly placed in my preschool classroom and read to the children by another teacher.  If you are planning to buy this book be aware that some of the themes in the book may not be appropriate for children under 6-7 years old.  This book deals with a child being taken away from home, friends and family then losing a prized possesion.  The book also includes talk about war and soldiers with guns.  My class had difficulty understanding why Emi was being taken away.  This book is more suited to children much older 
 I finally had to give up on this book after suffering through the first 100 pages.  The book is a collection of articles supposedly linking certain tenets of Christianity to the perennial philosophy.  Having read the perennial philosophy and having studied the eastern religions for several years, my expectations were high.  I read the first few articles and just could not see their connections to the perennial philosophy.  I also found the articles themselves to be of extremely limited usefulness on their own merits.  If you are trying to find a glimmer of hope in the Christian world view, as I was, by seeking a connection to the perennial philosophy, particularly as it relates to the eastern practices, look elsewhere.  
 I had heard of Edgar Cayce before, mainly because I shelved so many books by or about him in my years as a bookseller. It was only recently, though, as I was browsing through one of the Stranger than... books by the late Frank Edwards that I  came across a brief biography of Edgar Cayce and learned more about his mysterious diagnoses given while unconscious. I remembered that I had this book, one of the Time-Life Collector's Library of the Unknown reprints, on my shelf and so I dug in.   For the most part, the prose was easy to read and written in a straightforward, familiar style, so that I felt like I was seeing the events of Cayce's life as they happened. The book begins like a normal biography, discussing early romances, jobs, family incidents, etc., with very little to indicate how strange Mr. Cayce's life would become. Around 1/3 of the way through the book, we discover, along with young Edgar, that he can memorize written materials just by sleeping on them. He also discovers that he has miraculous powers to diagnose illnesses and prescribe cures for people he has never met, all while unconscious. (In his waking life, Mr. Cayce was very modestly educated, and was as surprised as anyone at the ideas and language that came from his unconscious form.) The way that this section of the book reads, you would imagine that Cayce's cures were always successful and that skeptics were fools.  The book begins to drag after the second half, though, for a variety of reasons. First, Cayce could never actually put his powers to any real end. Every attempt to establish a multidisciplinary hospital to implement and research his unconscious revelations, as was his dream, came to an unsuccessful conclusion. This is fairly anticlimactic and does not make for a very "heroic" story. Second, one of his benefactors, a man quite interested in matters occult, began to ask Cayce more arcane questions, and so the revelations began to drift into, to me, less interesting areas-the typical new age stuff about Atlantis, reincarnation, soul mates, etc. Finally, it became more apparent to me, based on the later, more thoroughly documented cases, that Cayce's "miraculous" cures might not have been as amazing as they seemed in the earlier chapters; the earlier cures seemed more amazing simply because the way in which they were recorded and related was more "oh gosh" and less stringent. (In other words, as he gets older and more jaded, even his cures seem less special and miraculous. Maybe this was the writer's intention.)    The conclusion of the book was, for me, the worst part. It is divided into two appendix-like sections. In the first section, the author tries to systematically describe Cayce's philosophy. Boring. Too much like the Ascended Master stuff that I find hard to swallow. Maybe it is true. Maybe not. Whenever I read this stuff, I just get the feeling that I am listening to some pedantic, New England minister lecturing on matters that were expressed much more interestingly 2,000 years ago by Hindus and Buddhists. The second section in the conclusion recounts six case studies from the Cayce files, and these are interesting only for those who want to see how difficult to understand Cayce's medical diagnoses could be, due to the odd structure of his language and the outdated medical terminology.  It was a quick read, except for those two concluding sections, so if you are at all interested, I highly recommend reading it. As for what it means, though, I really have no clue. And I don't plan on re-reading it to find out, though the pretty Time-Life book will remain on my shelf as decoration.    
 This book is very limited in its helpfulness.  The title is very misleading, because Minot only knows what he's talking about in one of them.  He should not even have attempted to touch drama.  I wonder if he's ever even seen a play, as his attempts to instruct are completely off.  Minot also focuses heavily on "don't do" lists rather than the instruction of helpful insight.  In three words:  the book blows 
 I usually try not to be too mean to a new author (as I am one, myself).  The plot was predictable, boring and simplistic.  That was not the worst part.  Now to the characters  Kattan duRhys: My God, he was weak-willed, utterly devoid of passion, he was whining on every page and annoying to no end.  I did not find him endearing at all, and skipped every line he spoke.  WHo is Kattan? "Weakling in Tights"  Melisande-- .....another simple-minded..... She's even WORSE than Kattan.  I can't imagine someone more obnoxious and totally empty of compassion and intellect than this character.    Wolfram-the only character worth rooting for, other than the dogs.  He was well-rounded, sharp, and actually knew what the heck was going on.    The pros: the songs were nice, I wish there were MORE.  After all, it was supposed to be about a BARD Hero.  Where were the songs? What happened to them whenever that annoying simpleton, Kattan opened his mouth?  I can't imagine a book where I've enjoyed less than watching six-second commericials about after shave.     
 Disappointing Siddons.  A depressing story of one demented woman destroying everyone around her.  No matter how well written, it is still depressing to the end.  Save your money unless you like to read detailed descriptions of madness leading to grief and loss and destroyed lives 
 This book was suspenseful at first, but soon became a "video game". Every corner turned was a new problem or a "monster". The book soon devolved into a trip down Christian Land. In the end, I feel like I was beat over the head with a Watch Tower 
 On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives. The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce. Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates. A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side. I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult. If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example.  Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for. Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument. But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions 
 The Age of Access provides a thorough report on the dissonance of traditional culture in a technological sphere at the turn of the century focussing on the derivatives of capitalism from a social and economic perspective. Jeremy discusses the impact of electronic commerce on society, but omits the role of the individual in the formation of culture; he acknowledges the value of ideas and intangible assets, but disputes the commercial power of multinational corporations. The Age of Access takes the blue tack of economics and the red tack of politics and bounds them together to make them undistinguishable from each other by inadvertently encrypting the concept of capitalism and statism. The main flaw of the book is that it feeds on the readers false assumptions of capitalism. The Age of access more subliminally describes how the shift from individual rights to the violation of privacy is transforming modern life. The author does not take into account that a culture does not come up with ideas, individuals do, and that a superficial society that suppresses individualism will naturally deteriorate.  
 I think that this book is too condensed.  I am trying to get my daughter familiar with the jungle book for the DVD release in October and this book was a start but it leaves a lot to be desired 
 I have been an avid reader and listener of the Arab-Israeli conflict for two decades. Of these many hundreds of articles and programs never once have I heard a major Jewish organization or leader call those merely criticizing Israel anti-Semitic. At the same time I have heard people like Noam Chomsky, David Duke, Amy Goodman, Robert Faurisson, Norm Finkelstein, Alexander Cockburn, Robert Fisk and their followers repeat this unfounded claim. Why would all of these people repeatidly make these false claims. Let's think about what the above people have in common and why they would create a lie about Jews calling those who merely criticize Israel anti-Semites. I assure you the above mentioned names know exactly why they have created this canard. Someone help me to figure this out 
 I found this book to be extremely boring.  While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like.  The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to  be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes 
 As a long time fan of Dionne, I cannot recommed this cd to anyone other than die hard fans. There are much better versions of all the tracks available. If you want to hear how this album might have sounded, try Cliff Richard's 2006 duets cd "Two's Company"...featuring Dionne Warwick on Anyone Who Had A Heart. Dionne sounds so good and the production is excellent. 
 If you're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is evil/pathetic/wrong/or whatever look elsewhere.  Flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point.  He relies on, for example, what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs.  Look at the footnotes in Chapter 4.  I'm sorry but this is like looking for a Leno's Jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement.  Also in Chapter 4, Flynn lays out the 5 myths of the left.  Does the left actually believe them?  As a bleeding heart liberal who knows mostly other bleeding heart liberals I'll give my response:  1)	American Women Live Under a Patriarchy - his point is that women in America are better off than just about anywhere else.  True, but that doesn't mean they don't live under a patriarchy. 2)	America is the World's Leading Threat to the Environment - his point is that places like Russia and China are far worse.  No one I know disagrees with his point.  3)	America is a Racist Nation - His point is that we are not.  I don't know any liberals who think America is a Racist nation 4)	The United States is an Imperial Power - as this was published in 2002 I'll abstain from commenting other than to say that he says the left believes that the international growth of Starbucks, McDonalds and such is cultural imperialism.  I think many liberals would agree with that.  He says most of the countries embrace these companies opening stores in them.  I say that doesn't mean its not cultural imperialism. 5)	The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer.  His argument is apparently that individuals who were in the lowest 20% of the income bracket in 1979 were mostly not in 1988.  He cites and article in the National Review where these numbers came from.  That article sites a Treasury Department survey.  So he's relying on secondary sources for his information?  Looks like shoddy research to me.    The book is riddled with problems.  For example, On pg. 31 he quotes Robert Altman as saying that we were in a way for Afghani oil interests.  Flynn then says that its not clear who Altman was referring to or why he would say that about a country without major oil reserves.  Here Flynn misses a perfect opportunity to attack a widely held liberal belief that Bush attacked Afghanistan for a potential pipeline that could be used to get oil out of Central Asian countries.  He doesn't though.  He lets it lie.  This is the nature of my problem with him.  Again and again his attacks are inept or simply untrue.    Reading his summary of why the Left hates America is just tripe.  No one I know thinks like this.  He says we believe capitalism is a failed economic system.  I don't know anyone who believes this.  Personally, I believe in universal healthcare but that's primarily because I've dealt with HMO's before.  He also says the Left condemn Christianity as intolerant.  Once again, no one I know believes this.  This book is full on nonsense.   
 Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
 I've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. I was attracted to this one by the low cost, but I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether. 
 I realize that I am in the minority here, but this book did not have what Earth Song had. When I read Earth Song, I could not wait to get my hands on the final novel of this trilogy. When I read it I was very disappointed. The hero, Roland, was horrible mean throughout the story to a point that became difficult for me to stomach. In a way, I could understand why he acted the way he did because he did believe, with just cause, that his wife, Daria, was pregnant with someone else's baby. However, when Daria suffered a miscarriage, he acted downright cruel. She suffered a miscarriage saving the life of one of his friends, and when she was recovering, Roland made it apparent that he was more concerned about the guilt his friend was feeling. In fact, he physically carried her into his friends room and told her that she was going to stop being so self-centered and assuage his friends guilt. After I read this, I could not give any credibility to the fact that he ended up professing his love to Daria, and I felt that she deserved better. I realize that I was reading a medeival romance, but that does not mean that it has to have a hero who can be so cruel and mean about one of the most tragic things that can happen to a woman. If anyone wants to read a truly good medeival romance, try Castles In the Air by Christina Dodd 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 I tried, really I did, to read these books. They were very difficult to understand. I even did an online discussion with "experts" to try to figure out what was going on, but it just didn't happen. I read "As I Lay Dying" entirely & the story behind the story told by the "experts" was okay, but did not make the read worth the time. The 2nd book, I couldn't get past the first few chapters & by the third book, I had given up. Definitely not my style 
 I had to read this for school. Maybe I would have liked it if I had just read it without worrying about the reading analysis that came after. But no matter. The book started off great. I really liked Salai's character in the beginning. His thievery was very funny and I liked how he threw up on the head of the man he was standing on :D because he ate too many cookies. But after that, it got kind of dull. Salai stopped his funny comments "Those scholars could get peed on by a horse and they wouldn't know what had happened without looking it up in a book!". Salai also seemed like a lying cheat, because he was selling Leonardo's private ideas and techniques for drawing to other artists in the area. And all throughout the story, there was no reference to the Mona Lisa! That's what the story is supposed to be about, right? The Mona Lisa was only referred to in the last chapter! What was the whole book for? And, oh my gosh, there was absolutely no conflict in the story! I heard E.L. Konigsburg was good, but what happened to this book, we'll never know. The book's simply outrageous. I give it 2 stars only because Salai was funny in the beginning. He actually made me laugh. 
 I thought I was getting a book on franchises that was a ratings of franchises.  This might as well have been condensed into a 5 page booklet on franchise cost.  It did however, contain some good contact numbers for someone who has no idea of where to start their franchise search 
 I returned this book.  It is boring and seems very old fashioned.  More like a textbook than a parent guide which was what I was looking for 
 I wasn't going to add another bad review (although it deserves many :0), but I noticed nobody mentioned that not only is it a terrible survey, but some answers are incorrect as well!     My university offered a course to prep for the GRE- for which this was the text.  All of us, professor included, realized quite quickly to trash it and throw some ETS practice tests up on the overhead!    
 It would have been better to label it "Best of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas"  than this misleading title.  It is just a rehash of selections from their previous albums; all of which I already have so this was a waste of $14 cause stores won't take back OPENed CD's.  (anybody got a shrinkwrap machine handy??) 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I've been a big Red Sox and Johnny Damon fan for a long time. Now, I don't think so much of Johnny. I figured, with the book being billed as a narrative on his baseball life, that it would be very biographical--what happened to him throughout his life. As others have said, he certainly did not fail to highlight the amazing ballplayer he saw in himself. He genuinely thinks very highly of himself. It was quite shocking. The one part that really brought me over the edge of not liking the book so much was when he talked about how he should have made the All-Star team, but Joe Torre never picked him. At one point, he also says that he had a chance to be named the 30th man to the All-Star roster, but Ichiro's fans in Japan got on the internet and voted. I can certainly understand those feelings if they were coming from a fan. Like I said, I really loved the image of Johnny Damon I knew before. I am sorry to say that he really did come off as a bit of a jerk in the book.   
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 You do not need to read this book to get your kicks out of know what happened before Episode II. Just listen to Samuel Jackson's line, "They just returned from a border dispute on Ansion." That's it. That's what they've been doing. Everything about this book was bad. People dancing with lightsabers? Singing? ach...enough to make a person vomit just by reading the words...pass it PLEAS 
 I enjoyed Wicked, and my daughter and I like those of Maguire's children-oriented works that we've read, but this one "lost" me. I took a few stabs at it, but it just didn't hold me enough to even finish -- and I almost never give up without finishing a book I've started. Other reviewers have commented that Maguire keeps the reader too distant from the characters and the story, and that he brings in perhaps too many elements to keep the story well focused; I must agree with that. He brings in (jumbles together?) many things and, though I'm generally tolerant of picking through the strands of complicated knots, I wasn't held enough to see the possible payoff as worth the effort. It wasn't terrible (as far as I read), but if I'm going to do the work of slogging through a tough read, there needs to be enough I like that it doesn't seem too much of a chore 
 This humidifier is great for programing humidity, fan speed, sleep mode, etc. BUT IF YOU HAVE HARD WATER DO NOT BUY IT. It puts out white dust that will go all over your house. I have three Sharper Image Ionic breezes, on two floors of my house. I had to clean them every day and they were covered with white dust. Besides that;  my furnature , TV screen, etc.were covered with white dust within two days. I buought a Honeywell with a exchangable filter that uses vapor rather than mist to humidify the air. This works great. Very little white dust. Half the cost 
 I have read several Law of Attraction books (including this one).  All of these books have a common theme--a focus upon  oneself as the source of fulfillment. Guess what?  It's not about you! If you want to change what you attract, you will never succeed by looking to yourself.  You must first make God the center of your universe.  This is not a message that many of us want to hear or accept because our Western culture is based upon self-gratification. When you seek God and make Him the focus of your life, guess what happens?  All of your needs (and more) are fulfilled. That is His promise and God never breaks His promises.  If you are sincere about having a fulfilling and meaningful life, I suggest you read The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren.  
 I really enjoyed Bear Family's Robert Mitchum two-fer "That Man" and immediately bought this disc when I saw it. First of all, the content is lighter weight than his other albums. These tracks from his early filmwork are great for the Mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man's singing ability should be directed to "That Man" or "Calypso Is Like So". My complaint (and the reason I didn't give it a higher rating) is the packaging. I thought it was beautiful when I first opened it. A shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info. Then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing. Then, the pages started falling out of the book! The whole thing literally fell apart on me! For a pricey import disc such as this, it's totally unacceptable. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I'm not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out. If you feel you must buy this disc, a word of caution: handle with care 
 I couldn't even read half of this garbage before wanting to throw it away! Vicki Iovine tells a very negative story of Motherhood, and as a first time Mom to be, I couldn't be more nervous aobut it. Thank God I read many of the other reviews which claim this book is highly exaggerated. I am going to try to return the book tomorrow. Do not waste your time here unless you want to be depressed about Motherhood 
 I bought this vehicle for my son...we have been through 2 already...they do not work. The controller is not made very well...the two cars we bought did not respond..the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work...the other car would only go forward...and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought. Definitely a disappointment 
 it was a good book to read through but not buy alltogethe 
 I have a business background so someone thought I'd enjoy a "business" book as a Christmas gift. Bad idea! I've read plenty of books in this genre and this seems to cut and paste from all of them. I thought this guy was supposed to be some kind of business guru but, from what I managed to make myself read, he is struggling for new ideas.  And unless you're an rabid man-hater I'd stay away from Ch. 21 altogether, sexism disguised as progressive thought.  Lots of better books out there if you want to get some idea of upcoming economic trends, just browse any well-stocked business section at a local bookstore. As for this one I managed to convince the store clerk to let me exchange it for something a little more interesting 
 This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short 
 After two weeks and several conversations with tech support, I could not get the pen to write to my computer (Word), though the internal test showed communication.  I returned it to the mfg.  Got it back with no info as to what they discovered.  Tested or no?  Repaired or no? So I tried it and it now does write to computer, though with little accuracy.  The problem is, with no comunitcation from their Customer Support, I don't know if it works due to repair or because I upgraded from 1 gig to 2 gigs of ram.  Oh well, one can't get it right every time 
 It does not give any practical guides on switching power supply design, it's just an overview of topologies. Useles 
 IN 1998 Clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction. Terrorist are americas greatest threat.  Clinton swept the first bombing OF WTC under the rug...The CIA/intelligence failed the american people numnerous times.  America fights terrorist who  are the true infidels.  They will kill, behead, drag our bodies down streets every chance they can........Americans, many are in total denial of how serious/evil terriorst in  Iraq, Iran, Syria and other countries are.  It is amazing how Americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies.   TERRORIST 
 As we flipped through the Rough Guide to Guatemala 2002 edition about a month ago, we were really impressed with the layout and the backdoor feel that the Rough Guide had as opposed to the more conventional guide books. Our only hesitation was that the practical information like hotels and transportation schedules might be out of date because it was published so long ago. We found out that a new version of the Rough Guide to Guatemala was going to come out right before we left for our trip so we decided to hold out until it was published. We were so excited when it arrived and couldn't wait to get to Guatemala. When we arrived, however, it became immediately apparent that Rough Guides had not bothered to live up to their claim of reliability. The information in the guide was completely outdated. We ran into logistical problems at every turn. I understand that Guatemala is one of the countries that is in a state of constant flux but some of the hotel recommendations in the book had disappeared years ago. On the whole, the book was good for the ideas of what to see and do and the history of the country but logistically speaking, it left much to be desired. We ended up forgetting the book completely for logistical planning and asked the locals instead. 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 This DVD covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds!  It does not give enough BODY to the addition explanation and is hard to follow.  It was a pure waste of money 
 I recived this cd as a gift. I was never a big fan of this group and after giving this cd a listen, i know why, because I feel that their music really wasn't that good.  For the most part they were part of the drug culture of the sixties, but their music fails to express the true essence of the era.  The doors, traffic, the turtles, the animals and/or the zombies were much better bands whose music captures the culture of the time.  Dylan and Melanie were also part of the folk scene but were much more creative than this band.  I don't understand why so many people liked this group, i think they were avarage at best.  In my opinion, this is not a CD worth owning and they do not deserve to be part of the 20th century masters collection 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 this was a stupid book hence the name stupid book a boy named cloyd is staying with walter and a new friendship formed it was dumb if you have to do a report that is due in 3 days and you have to choose between a 7,998,654,123 page book on taxes and the 90 page book called bearstone for goodness sake choose the tax book. All the book talks about is an indian sitting there on his butt making kissing faces. 
 It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together 
 I tutor and this is the worst Geometry textbook I've had to use. Geometry is a new branch of mathematics to most students and can be difficult to comprehend. This book only makes it worse. The lack of examples and clear explanation is very frustrating. I empathize with any student forced to endure this text 
 The first page of this book reinforced my belief that no one should attempt to reproduce Jane Austen's writing style.  The cumbersome results always sound as if they were written by Mr. Collins. Presumption: An Entertainment is no exception. Hopefully, someone, someday will have the good sense to keep the wonderful characters that Jane Austen created, get out of their way and allow them to tell the story. It would be that simple if the right person chose to do it.  
 Bought this TV in September, worked perfectly until it died unexpectedly in February.  Called service at Samsung, they assigned it to a local repair person.  No call back, finally tracked down the repair man and he wanted me to take the TV to him. Total of 2 weeks lost on that, I then called Samsung back, they dispatched a larger repair shop after numerous calls to schedule an appointment they finally came out two weeks later and couldn't fix the TV.  They told me I'd have to call Samsung for an exchange, Samsung agreed to an exchange. After a week, when no shipping company called I call Samsung back. I was informed the LNS4092DX/XAA is no longer available.  They agreed to ship a different model instead.  Long story short - 2 months later - still no TV - I spoke to them today 4/18 and I was assured that the shipping company has the TV (in spite of their denials) and that I would have the new TV in ... you guessed it.. 2 weeks.  Not sure if the TV was a lemon, but their customer service sure is!  On the plus side, a telemarketing firm did call me to survey me on the service technician 
 We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 Just awful, don't waste your money 
 Although I found the passages about Ms. Williams relationships with her mother and grandmother and their struggles with cancer to be well-written and moving, I am surprised that she and many other reviewers imply that the cancers were the consequences of nuclear testing.  I think of myself as an environmentalist, and I believe that such testing is likely to have been harmful to human health; however, the striking family history of breast and ovarian cancer in this case strongly suggests that there is a genetic disorder (mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) that was responsible for the cancer in these women.  I was living in Salt Lake City during the spring of 1983, and the flooding was indeed dramatic, but I was bored by the rather repetitious descriptions of the refuge and the birds 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution contained far more relevant information than The Atkins Essentials.  Frankly put, if you already have one of the Atkins books, don't waste your money and buy more.  All you need is one 
 I was disappointed in this book.  It detailed the thoughts of women turning 60 who had many advantages in life, in terms of education, family help and encouragement, the luck to connect with the right mentor at the right time.  I would have been much more interested in the thoughts of less privileged women, more ordinary women.  I couldn't help thinking that it may be easier to have a positive view of aging if you are already a woman of accomplishment by the time you hit your forties.  For some, the greatest accomplishement of their lives may be successfully raising a family, completing an advanced education later in life or simply a life devoted to volunteerism. I'd be interested in their thoughts.  That's what I thought I was getting, at least in part.  A nice mixture of women from different socio-economic groups would have been most welcome 
 This would have to rank as one of the worst movies of all time. Overlong, boring, dreadful acting, embarrassing  screenplay. By the time you get to the battle sequence (meant to be the movie's centrepiece) you're so bored that you don't care what happens to any of the main characters. In fact, you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end. But I did find it very funny to listen to the dreadful dialogue, so at least I got some amusement from it.  I actually found the battle scenes quite disrespectful to the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Scenes of people dying horribly using modern-cinema realism and gore was quite repulsive and offensive. I'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it. As I watched the gore-fest that is the battle, I wondered what those people who died that day would think of the way their deaths were portrayed - like some ghoulish freakshow for us 60 years later to watch and say with a morbid smile on our face ... Oooooo ... ahhh ... yuck. It would have been much better if Bay had gone down the tasteful, respectful path rather than the shock, showman route.  My favourite cringe-worthy lines -  Alec Baldwin as the General (or whatever he was) - The heart of a volunteer is the noblest of all.  Josh Hartnett, while looking at himself in the mirror wearing his uniform - (Crying) You know, whenever I see mahself in this here uniform .... I just don't feel like a hero. (Cries some more).  Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie. Whenever we see Americans, there is beautiful music playing behind images of pretty scenery and lovely, bright colours. Whenever the Japanese are shown, we see dark, grey tones and booming, dark, evil music thumping away. Cut back to Americans ... cue pretty music and bright colours. Talk about manipulate the audience's emotions, rather than Bay making his point in some subtle way ... like a good script.  How can anyone think this piece of garbage is worth 4 stars?  The soundtrack is incredible though. Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderous. Its a pity his talent and genius was wasted on such trash 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 If you want my advice before buying this one,  it's this: Save your money 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 Mr. Simmons's story is a cautionary tale of lies and deception.  He is delusional about the lack of recovery and involves those who love him in his "quicksand of lies and cruelty."   He claims to have loved those who care for him and yet he hurts them and worst, expose them to the risk HIV/AIDS with his reckless behavior.  I had hoped to read further his story redemption and atonement for those he had hurt that he claimed to love.   There is no such ending 
 Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
 The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these.  To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton.   These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this -  and neither do you.  
 I had hopes that this magazine would be a nice alternative to the others out there.  From the moment I opened it, it felt so smug.  I gave it a chance and read it cover to cover (the April issue).  But what finally did me in (after having read that I could buy an $800 blouse to make me feel pretty in that after pregnancy stage, that I could match my children's shoes to my Jimmy Choo's and finally that I could buy my child the latest $300 tricycle) was the article entitled "Normal" about a child who was misdiagnosed with Autism.  The article discussed how distraught the mother was after her child was diagnosed with Autism to the point that she tried to committ suicide.  The article ended with the fact that the child turned out to be a genius.  What was the point of this article?  To say thank God it wasn't true?  What about those parents out there who have an autistic child, how does this article make them feel? The article was painful and insensitive.  There are better ways to spend you $10 than on Cookie 
 You can't follow the thread of Catherine Russell's argument; you can only pretend to, whether you're posturing for stuck-up film theory boyz or forced to "identify the central concepts" in film class.  Just  read one of her sentences, and then ask yourself, "What is she trying  to say?"  I'll start you off:  "Viola's use of video is informed  by an existentialist theory of medium specificity.  His treatment of  possession is thus ontological and in many ways a more successful version  of the 'cine-transe' imagined by Rouch" (234). Over 300 pages of such  absurd drivel make this book unreadable.  Don't read it passively--question  every word, every invented phrase, every name she drops.  Her goal is to  sound creative and learned ("the cartography of modern culture"  *is* a neat phrase), but are we really impressed?  No.  Well-written books  give you plenty of ideas for your time.  This crazy offal just gives you  one: film theory is utterly pointless 
 As a Sinatra fan, I can tell you that this does not represent his best output. I hate to be cynical but part of me wonders if this album was prompted by a desire to squeeze just a bit more cash out of some tired old numbers.  There was no point getting Sinatra to re-record a selection of favourites - he was too old and his voice had all but gone (let's face it).  So why not get him to croak a few lines and then fill in the gaps with some lesser stars and then market it as a duets album?  The instrumental arrangements and the band itself are great.  But the singing is at best uninteresting and at worst laughable.  The duet with Bono is a complete joke, the one with Barbara Streisand tedious and uninspiring.  In fact, just about the only one that is at all enjoyable is the duet of Summer Wind with Julio Iglesias.  No, this is not a good album and the third-rate quality of it is highlighted by the rumour that Sinatra pre-recorded his bits and the others filled in the gaps later. I find that very easy to believe.  There are so many good Sinatra albums and collections around, so why would you bother with this offering?  Go listen to him in his prime 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 While I agree in principle that a citation book should be readable and easy to use, I find ALWD to be decidedly useless in the real practice of law. Although forced to purchase the book as a 1L, I have to meet an attorney, judge or legal scholar that uses it or would like it to replace the Bluebook. In fact, during a firm interview, the attorney and I joked that we would like to start an anti-ALWD club to prevent 1Ls from being tricked into preferring ALWD over Bluebook. Sorry ALWD 
 This volume has just about all the wrong versions that are supposed to be extended long play club versions. Not to mention, it's almost all tracks that have been used on other volumes in the series. Track times:  1. last dance (5:53) (edit) 2. thank god it's friday (4:27) (7") 3. fame (5:17) (long version) 4. star wars theme (6:26) (not the 15 minute album version) 5. chase (4:23) (1985 REMIX) 6.

 ...and that emptiness and boredom and blankness are the only emotions which author transferred to me as his reader through the medium of his words and it feels like a disease which is called "I am one of GenXers". While being not exactly the effect the author probably aspired to achieve by his novel, it perfectly matches with the true state of lives and feelings of the people like the ones acting roles in his story. And by this, the work proves the eternal unity of the art and real life, both always creations of the creator.. 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining! 
 I bought the CD because I thought it was instrumental music. Then I hit the tracks with vocals - Yikes!  This is the only CD of Lee Ritenour that I bought.  I am a first time listener. I must say that I do like the instrumental music very much. However, I really hate the tracks with vocals. 
 As all of the other posters state this controller has a serious issue with its batteries. I, too, contacted the company and without any question they sent two replacement... no qualms with that kind of service, but the new batteries died just as quickly. I even tried removing the back cover (which was successful) revealing 2 NiMH 1.2V 280mAh batteries. However, the were both seated in the casing properly. I may try and replace them, however the bottom line is that I shouldn't have to go through all of this hassle. My recommendation is to buy a wireless PC gamepad that works the first time... am I not wise? :- 
 I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage. This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA. Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book. Every time has its own trash-best-seller. About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc. This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible. 
 I agree with the above review. Pluralism is not possible with religion. The Spanish Inquistion was in place for over 300 years. How long will radical Islam perform its copy-cat brand of insanity? 
 Evidently a lot of people love this man's writing, but they must be loving something else because this book is about worthless. Forgetting the issue of PC-ness he broaches by having an Arab-American as the terrorist of the title, it's just not very likely. Other reviewers have said that he chose this character as his instrument to reflect on the state of America today, and his origin serves solely as a plot device to cause his disaffection with this society. But I think if that's the case, it's a weak and unnecessary device, given that there are plenty of Americans who are as disaffected and more prone to violence than some half-Arab New Jersey teenager. As a matter of fact, although it's a topic not often discussed, the main terrorist threat in America comes from white Christian extremists. These people aren't even theoretical; they've actually been responsible for real terrorist acts all over the United States.  Be that as it may, Updike is one of the least astute character writers I've ever read. If anyone reading this doesn't like that assessment, I suggest picking up Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" or "The Brothers Karamazov". Now that's some character writing. I just felt like he endlessly described people's outsides and never touched their insides. It's a book, which means that you have the ability to show the reader the thoughts and feelings of a person, but not to adequately depict their facial expressions or colorations (in other words, it's not a picture). And yet he rarely took the opportunity to get inside anyone's mind, even the main character Ahmad's. And what little internal narration he did give Ahmad was pretty much the same thing over and over again. As for the other characters, he may have intended them to be mockeries of real people instead of making them real people, but if he was doing that I certainly didn't pick up any hints of satire to clue me in. The whole book was dead serious, and dead boring.  I tend to lump all books into two main categories: they're either about the characters or the plot. Given that the characters were such a failing in this book, you might be tempted to think the plot redeems it in some way. You would be wrong. The story itself advances slowly with about three-fourths of the book being wasted in unnecessary build-up (which would be fine if there were decent characters, but as it is...). The climax is so anti-climactic it actually made me sleepy. There's absolutely no payoff in the end.  If you're a fan of this guy, perhaps this book could work for you. For me, it was an unfortunate reading choice and a complete waste of time. If you want to read books about domestic terrorists that are just as implausible but a lot more exciting, pick up Tom Clancy 
 The bed lift system is OK if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read. However, I did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you weren't centered in the bed 
 I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher 
 I failed to realize that this was a book "edited" by as opposed to written "by" David Sedaris until his introduction. Incidentally, the introduction was the only portion of the book that I actually enjoyed. His analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to  pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song. I do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes.  I do not think they were bad stories. Actually, I would like to take that back, if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad. It was, however, impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the GRE vocabulary words in one short story.   I will not stop buying the books that David Sedaris authors, I will just be more careful. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer/storyteller. He may not capture all or even any of the elements of a "good" short story; I would not know an element of a good short story if I ran into one coming off the elevator. I do know that David Sedaris' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism. I can not wait for the next book he actually writes 
 This book is as bad as his radio show.  Edell is a pompous fool.  He never met a drug he didn't like. The answer to every problem is a prescription drug.  In addition, he believes people should have the freedom to use non-prescription drugs like marijuana and cocaine.  Yet, we shouldn't have the freedom to use supplements like vitamins and herbs.  He wants the medical industry and the government to take control of those.  He has an inferiority complex because he was never circumcised and was made fun of as a kid because of it.  He rails against circumcision despite overwhelming evidence showing its value.  Edell is the type of guy that gives doctors a bad reputation.  He thinks he knows it all and that people are too ignorant to make decisions about their health 
   The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny 
 I tested this out as soon as I got it and was not thrilled with the results.  The steamer barely took the wrinkles out of a satin shirt after I used almost the entire container of water.  The product might work better on cotton or a sturdier fabric.  In a pinch, if you have the time to go over the garment numerous times this item is for you.  From what I have read this is one of the best of the travel garment steamers.  Maybe my expectation were a little to high. Pros -Easy to use -price (same product at Sharper Image for lots more) Cons -Helped but didn't get all the wrinkles out 
 Is there any reason that the narrator has to have a thick Spanish accent? Dora doesn't. It is so bad in fact that in parts my daughter actually asks, "what?" 
 This release should have been titled Michael Nyman: Gattaca Soundtrack, since that's all that it is. A collection of Nyman's tracks.   And yes, they are very good, no doubt about it, but where is Charlie Haden and Stan Getz's exquisite "First Song (for Ruth)", the wonderfully emotional smoky jazz number from the scene on the dancing floor? And what happened to Django Reinhardt's "Nuages" ?  If they included ALL THE ARTISTS' work on this cd, it would earn the right to be called "a soundtrack". Why did the producers emphasize only Nyman? Don't they want to make the best soundtrack compilation for us from the music pieces the movie provides? No, they don't. Including Nyman exclusively was a marketing decision, and not a move towards satisfying their listeners. For that - this cd gets one star. Since Nyman's work is so good, i'll give it two stars 
 Wow! What a treasure trove of ideas and patterns!  You will love this book 
 I bought this CD already familiar with the Dance/Trance/Techno scene for years, listened to a few times and never picked it up again. I picked up this CD since it had Tilt's - I Dream (Resurection Remix) - (which is the only track that carries a captivating beat - truly awesome) thinking that the rest of the CD would be just as incredible. Unless your gonna get sloshed or shoot up on something and freak dance to strobe lights amist a booming sound system, don't waste your money on this one. Until I personally decide to do this myself, only then would I rate this a five. Sasha must have better mixes out there that I have not yet discovered, but whatever the case, this CD is a disappointment. Rather than letting this CD uselessly spin in my CD deck, I simply use it as a coaster. I know many will disagree with this review but given the fact that I gave this CD an honest shot, I not writing this as a hater. I simply have not been impressed with this one. This mix carries the same monotonous beat from start to finish. Honestly, there has to be better mixes out there by Sasha... But don't waste your ears on this one.  If you liked other CDs like: Trance Mix USA, BT - Movement In Still Life, ATB - Dj In The Mix, Crystal Method - Vegas & Community Service, any mixes by Dj Micro, Tansport by Paul Oakenfold, Dj Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise, or any Gatecrasher Mix.... This CD may not be the one for you 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 "I was flushing the evil out....It was a good feeling knowing even though I might not be able to sleep, at least I'd feel clean."   17 year old Brendan and his friends Will and Kevin are the dregs of school society, the outcast, the fringe. Now they're in for a night of memories. After throwning back some Acid, they've hit the streets of Philly to enjoy themselves when the Pure Sunshine kicks in. The best and worst part about Sunshine is it makes everything else boring. It takes Brendan past all the normal experiences to where he can't enjoy anything anymore because of his desire for the next hit.   That's where Sunshine leaves him---at a place where the real and surreal mix together and separate in a way that leaves real life not worth as much as induced life. In the middle of a midnight trip, Brendan and the guys visit Sally, the downtown girl, so they can relax safely and enjoy their high. With so many girls that Brendan wishes he could take things deeper with, their night with Sally awakens a spark in him for something more. Not necessarily with Sally. Or any specific girl. But with something. For once, he feels his void.   Brian James' PURE SUNSHINE delves into the euphoria and pain people experience when addicted to LSD. While the details of the high can be intriguing at times, a sense of arc and story are strangely missing all the way through. The story is more a realization that drugs may not be everything Brendan's made them out to be. Thatâ(tm)s the only thing that can bring him back to the point he can enjoy reality again, give him a chance with the girl he's always wanted, and get him to a place he can feel clean for the first time in a long time.

 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 I don't usually feel strong enough to write reviews however don't buy this book unless you want to spend hours debugging someone elses code just for the fun of it.  I could have written my own in less time that it took me to fix the errors found in the code.  In addition you would expect the downloadable code to work and they don't either.  They are not even the same code examples found in the book.  Unless you want to pay for the ideas and what modules to use this book is a waste of money 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this 
 This was a well written book, and one I might have enjoyed......if I knew I was reading a secular novel.  I thought I was reading christian fiction, and waited thru almost the entire book for the christian message to shine thru.  I realized almost at the end of the book that was not going to happen. I had no reason to expect otherwise, as she has previously written christian fiction and I got it off the christian fiction shelf at the library.  I'm very glad I didn't pay for this book as I wouldn't have received what I thought I was paying for 
 Zacharias' poorly organised arguments never really address the core logic of atheism but rather attacks atheists for, at worst, imagined agendas, and at best for not taking the Pascalian wager (that it's better to gamble on God's existence than otherwise),  arguments which were much better placed forward by Blaise Pascal himself.  Modern theists of the foundationalist sort (as opposed to Catholic theologians, most of whom are better debaters) never really get to the heart of the debate, i.e., the logical critique of theism. Contemporary arguments for the existence of God like these are more deeply flawed than in ancient times (when the absence of scientific knowledge made it more difficult to debate). The postulated existence of a supreme being, for example, has empirically verifiable consequences that are never borne out.   RZ never anticipates atheistic rebuttals to theistic speculation, further exposing his impotence as a debater. I was hoping he might at least propose some answers to the 2300-year-old riddle of Epicurus: "Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"   Virtually every one of God's supposed attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence) when considered in conjunction, show his alleged existence to be self-contradictory and thus makes the existence of a supreme being not only improbable (given evidential considerations), but rather impossible (given logical considerations).   
 This was given to my 2 year old as a present.  It is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart.  The roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with.  The concept is good, all the animals and farmer are built very well, but it's frustrating to me and my son that it won't stay together. 
 I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks.  I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT" 
 To GHOST GAME's credit, I didn't cut it off; it entertained me enough to make me stay with it.  BUT..what a lame movie.  A plot that makes little or if any sense; actors whose talents are minimal; and sloppy direction and editing.  Three witches back in the mid-seventies were killed during some kind of ritual, but we're not really sure what, and even though by the end of the film, we "kinda" figure out who killed them, it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Then we have the typical group of college students (none who look under the age of 30) who for whatever reason decide to go spend a weekend at this camp where the witches died, and lo and behold, they find some kind of weird game which releases the witches and spells doom for the cast.  There aren't a whole lot of scares and the pacing isn't quick enough to generate any suspense, but there are a lot worse movies out there, so fans of this type of occult thriller may find themselves mildly diverted 
 This review will be simple: Garden State is fake, manipulative and annoying.  It tries way too hard, and every "idiosyncratic" element seems forced and insincere.  I hate to offened any reader out there, but the entire time I was watching this flick I had one re-occuring thought:  "This is a movie for Tools."  You know those big-budget, well-shot TV commercials for Cars or Cellphones? It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro-managed and insincere.   The compulsive, overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite. The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots "well" than making a decent movie.  Skip this one!  Cliched, derivative, phoney, forced.  If you're in the mood for something in this 'genre' just rewatch your Wes Anderson collection or maybe 'I Heart Huckabees' or even 'Eternal Sunshine...". Don't waste your time on this drivel

 I can tell you that the main plot is thrilling. The problem is where you can find it. The book goes out of the main story so many times that you almost forget what you're reading. The book's end lacks in wits, HC just got out of ideas and finished the book like a fairy tale: Everybody found what they wanted and lived happily ever after. That's not the way to finish this book because this book has a potential to a paramount end no matter if it's merry or not.  Query: Which were the good guys

 If you're looking for a thoughtful critique of the media, look elsewhere.  This book contains more name-calling within its pages than a junior high school does within its doors. The author indiscriminately hurls the epithet "right-wing" to describe just about everyone who isn't a Democrat.  Did Ted Kennedy ghostwrite this?   Bill O'Reilly is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a grandstanding populist.  John Stossel is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a libertarian.  Brock can't even give them the dignity of using an insulting term that actually describes who they are.  The left simply loses credibility and strips "right wing" of any discerable meaning when they brand everyone from George W. Bush (the biggest spender since LBJ) to the Cato Institute to Adolf Hitler as being "right wing."  Maybe most people in politics don't think about the meaning of words, only what effect they have, but readers of a long book deserve to have their intelligence respected.  Brock doesn't.  The errant insults, hyperbolic generalizations, and misrepresentations go on and on in this book.  At least Ann Coulter's off the wall attack books are entertaining.  Brock's sense of humor is apparently still under development, if he has one at all.  Yes, the book has some information in it that some people may find useful.  But the sneering writing style, for me at least, totally overwhelms and negates any value I may have otherwise derived from this hatchet job of a book.  So I'm giving it only 1 star

 Why on earth would anyone purchase this anthology when these tracks can be heard anytime for free by riding the elevators of office buildings, nodding off in airport lounges, or waiting in the checkout line at Wal-Mart?  Billy Joel is the gold standard of adult contemporary schmaltz; he pumps out the sludge by which all other sludge is measured.  Small wonder; his gift for writing hooks is amazing, he sings on-key without being interesting to listen to (which would be distracting), his ballads are so insipid that they're certain to offend no one, and his up-tempo numbers bear an eerie resemblance to rock without actually containing any of the bite or irreverence that are the hallmarks of real rock.    As for his lyrics, he is not the poet laureate of shopping malls for no reason.  Though he occasionally stumbles over content in his songwriting efforts, as he did in Allentown, he is far more at home in the woozy and comfortable world of words that, devoid of meaning, can roll smoothly from the tongue, scamper along the piano keys, and jump quickly into the cash register where they belong.  Examples abound but, has there ever been a song with less of a rock sensibility than Still Rock And Roll To Me?  It is pointless to deny Billy Joel's gift and his skill, he has demonstrated time and time again that his instincts for rising to the middle are infallible.  Many people have found pleasure in what he's produced over the years.  Awful music and wonderful music could not exist without music that is profoundly mediocre, songs that serenade the middlebrow.  That is Billy Joel land, the middle of the dial.  If he has any value at all, which is questionable, it is that he defines mediocrity and has made a science of it. 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 Dawes starts with the conclusion he wants to prove, and then selects only studies which agree with it.  We call this begging the question, or affirming the consequent.  He ignores myriad studies, including those conducted by NIMH, which prove that Cognitive Therapy IS effective.  Dr. Aaron Beck and Dr. Albert Ellis have pioneered new forms of therapy.  To dismiss them out-of-hand is short-sighted 
 The acclaim and good reviews for this book are mistaken - it is average work by an above average artist who his a sophomore slump with this, his second book. Sleeping by the Mississippi, as derivative as it may be, was deeper and more soulful than this work which offers not much new in contemporary photography. 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 This tracing type art toy is nearly impossible to use. The reflective panels do not securely attach and if you just brush them with your arm they fall down. There is no integrated light with the toy so you need to find a very well lit space to work.    My 5 year old and I were extremely frustrated with this toy and will be returning it 
 This is more "gimmick" than substance. Ironically, it's supposedly about generating substance, but it's basically a pep-talk and/or motivational kit replete with cute little "flare" and "swag" like badges that read "ask me about my novel." This could very well be useful and inspiring or even guiding to some people. To me, it's a bit like a motivational introduction to a multi-level marketing business...the business being your novel. And hey, if that fires you up, great! I expected a book of some substance with some real direction. If this were a kit on sky-diving, I suspect it would be called "No Chute, No Problem" and the kit's instructions would boil down to a flyer that reads "JUMP!" (granted...getting started on anything is 90% the battle...but a plan will be needed at some point...and that time is preferably before you leave the plane! 
 Ana Carolina is a good singer and Seu Jorge is a cult culture figure here in Brazil, but this CD is a mistake. Do not spend money on this 
 I checked this book out from the library the same time I checked out Bloom's other work, "Love Invents Us," which she appears to have written prior to this work. The title of this work comes from something Huddie says to Elizabeth Ann in "Love Invents Us" which apparently stuck in Bloom's mind as a title for another work. I read the book, but while the stories use beautiful imagery and the characters are well-described I did not find this book beckoning for me to read on. I felt like I was reading something I was forced rather than compelled to read. The title story is good, but nothing else sticks in my mind. "Rowing to Eden" was just flat out weird, in which the breast cancer sufferer's husband ends up with her lesbian best friend. Weird. Period. I loved "Love Invents Us" and found it much more 'alive' and entertaining while Bloom's work took a very different turn with this book. Perhaps I would have liked this collection if I were older, married. But this book was morose and gloomy, with characters I didn't to care to be introduced to, outside of Cole in "A Blind Man Could See How Much I Love You." For a better more interesting short story collection check out "My Date with Satan" by Stacey Richter. Bloom does not connect with her audience and entreat you to read further and want to understand the characters and motivations, which leaves one feeling uninvolved and lacking the intimacy that should be experiencing in reading. I was very disappointed 
 I just purchased this cd for my son. I was assuming it would be cute little songs to help him memorize his addition facts. Well, this cd has songs but they are mixed with this freaky story telling bits that are just plain weird. We got through the first several songs/stories before turning it off because the narrator/singer's voice (who sounded like he had smoked 5 packs of cigarrettes his entire life) on Stella's rag, actually scared my son and he hasn't wanted to listen to it since. 
 I miss the step to practice and would like to see these mathematical formulas work. For me it contained too much (unuseful) mathematics and proofs. Good maybe for mathematicians, but for banking people on the edge of being unreadable. It is very time consuming to browse more then 500 pages and then still to have to work out all details to implement things. Also the stochastic volatily models are too briefly covered 
 See Bonnie Raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs, actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `The Fundametal Things', but no 
 As some of the other reviewers have said, this book is very watered down.  The names of various utilities and how to install them from the command line & the graphical interface are mentioned, and in some cases a small amount of detail is provided.  This book provided a good starting point for most linux networking utilities but that is about it 
 Whoa! What flimsy piece of television journalism.  This biography episode manages to make the life of Juilia Child boring and dull. My guess is that the producer has never cooked a meal in his/her life and thinks of Julia Child a big lady with a funny voice.   Please just by Julia's My Life in France autobiograpy.   It's a fast, inspiring read any night and day from this hackish disservice to one of the most important figures in American culinary history 
 Making the Connction was terrific, and when I read Keeping the Connection, it was a few days after re-reading MTC. Literally 1/3 to 1/2 the book was a copy of the first. I was extremely disappointed. It is a fair book on its  own, but do not bother to buy both. And besides, Oprah's story in MTC is  really wonderful. Buy something by Suzanne Schlosberg instead 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 Oh, my word, this book is simply terrible. We read it in my English class during my senior year of high school, and I absolutely hated it. I read it merely for the sake of my grade. It was difficult to visualize half the book, and the parts I did understand were just horrible. I hated how the boys shifted to such barbaric behavior on the island. And the author's writing style, no offense, was awful, with a capital "A". I sure was relieved when my class finished the book, and I made a vow to never read this book ever again, if I could help it. If you haven't read this book yet, then take my advice and stay far away from it. Don't waste your good money on such a shoddy product. 
 Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews.  I was almost in tears I was so bored.  It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie!  I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable.  Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible.  The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog.  When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable.  Boy were we wrong.  This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time 
 The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter.  I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism.  He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years.  I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead.  It is an older book but much more reliable.  
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Was there nothing good that he could have said about her?  Surely being famous for 40+ years she must have done something right...according to this author, NOTHING!!  Don't waste your time or money on this.. 
  A few caveats.  I'm very liberal, and I've read most of the Warshawski series.  But this book is trying even my patience.  Last night I thought, I can't possibly be on p. 260 and not yet have a plot other than rich people are bad, and poor people are only hard-working and noble.  It can't be.  And it can't be that the plot so far is that the idealistic teenage heir (Romeo) of the rich bad guys--who own a not-so-veiled Wal-Mart-like retail giant--has fallen for the poor Latina (Juliet).  Sadly, though I'm supposed to, I don't care for Romeo or Juliet.  Nor do I care for any other character at this point, even Vic, who's doing all the same stuff she normally does (pissing off rich people, having Lotty tend to her wounds and then dining with her, taking the dogs out, arguing with Mr. Contreras) but to no end and exceptionally boringly.  I've read this stuff before, many times.  Get to something interesting!  This is really painful to read 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 A totally contrived and badly written book.  I found it hard to believe that this was written be a professional writer.  Based on the television series, which is actually interesting and fun to watch, this book suffers by comparison.  No character development whatsoever, stilted dialogue, stock characters.  Don't bother with this knock-off of Kathy Reich's wonderful series 
 According to the book, the Kellams lived a frugal life on their island, subsisting mostly on "peanuts and sardines." And they "wanted no machinery that would require fuel beyond the kerosene and gas lamps." Well, you don't have to go to a pristine wilderness to live like that. They could just as well have been living in a tenement in New York city, buying their canned sardines and bags of peanuts at the local market and using a bare bulb for light. It is easy to survive in the wilderness if you stockpile enough sardines and kerosene. What would have been a challenge is IF they had attempted to survive on what they could forage, fish, hunt, or grow with the tools they could make (like the Native Americans did). Simplicity is an easy thing if the canning factory is operating, the peanut farmers and merchants are toiling their trades, and one has enough of a pension to purchase those necessities.   
 I decided to give this book a chance, but wish I hadn't. The author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive.  That, combined with his extreme cynicism, really prevented me from enjoying the book. Not recommended 
 Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly 
 This book was one of the worst reading experiences I've had.  I can't imagine how the information in this book could be useful in any way.  The contributors are long-winded and never really say anything substantial, probably due to poor editing.  STAY AWAY! 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 With all the publicity this book got I thought I would learn something I didn't know.  Very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning.  Very disappointed 
 The play "Into the Woods" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
 I feel really bad for those poor students of Mr. Pearce who don't drop out of his class the first week.  This is the first book on public speaking that I've read where I honestly haven't taken anything from this book, and I've read about five.  He talks about all of the mechanics of public speaking, but something big is missing from this book.  Also, leadership via public speaking, which seems to be the titular topic of this book, is missing from the pages.  Mr. Pearce reminds me of one of my statistics professors.  This professor, which I'll call Mr. Banal, was a very smart person, had studied a lot, was up on the current statistics methodologies, and was a nice person.  However, Mr. Banal's lecture consisted almost entirely of an analysis of what he thought of the textbook.  Mr. Banal always had some new "insight"--which usually amounted to a very minor disagreement that he had with the author of the text.  He talked about this minor disagreement for the entire lecture hour.  I think that doing this allowed him to feel good about himself, because he was proving to the students that he was smarter than the author of the text.  This was really confusing to me.  Who should I believe, Mr. Banal or the author of the statistics text?  The author seemed a lot more interesting (which is funny considering the subject), but Mr. Banal was the one who ultimately would be testing me.  This is what Mr. Pearce does in his book.  He is constantly rewriting speeches of others into a "better speech."  A really funny example of this occurs during the end of the book, where he's quoting Anita Roddick, managing director of The Body Shop International.  Roddick is an excellent public speaker, and he quotes often from one of her speeches, which is probably the most interesting part of the book.  Toward the end, Mr. Pearce cherry picks a paragraph from her speech and reworks it.  The initial paragraph wasn't all that bad, but Mr. Pearce's "improved" version of it was terrible.  This is the same kind of difference between a sports commentator and an avid fan.  The sports commentator will describe the athlete, what the athlete did during the performance, and trace the effects of the athlete's performance.  This is very complex and requires a lot of skill.  The avid fan will say things like, "I would have done this...I would have done that."  This requires very little skill at all.  Mr. Pearce is the avid fan, telling us what he would have done, rather than actually doing anything himself.  It kind of seems like Mr. Pearce was writing this book for the dean of UC-Berkeley, rather than for the public 
 When Stephen Poliakoff, the prolific British screenwriter and director, is at his best, he has few peers.  But like Woody Allen, he is too prolific and apparently has no friends to tell him NOT to release some new creation of his, and he doesn't seem to lack for funding either. Hence, on the heels of his BBC gem, THE LAST PRINCE, he has produced two new movies, one of them so awful that I shall not even bother with the other.    In a 2006 TV-movie, FRIENDS AND CROCODILES, he spent a small fortune to mount a lavish production of an incoherent story about an eccentric American (played by Damiel Lewis) who has somehow made a fortune in England and bought a lavish estate.  One day he impulsively hires as his personal assistant a young woman (Jodhi May) whom he has seen a few times strolling at the perimeter of his property.  He tells her he wants her to organize his voluminous creative files, but soon after she does so, he throws a party to which he invites low-lifes and vandals who trash his property and thoroughly destroy all the work she has done for him.  She quits, of course, but years later, after a chance encounter, she meets him and recommends him for a high-paying job as a creative con- sultant in the company she works for, and he repeats the same self-destructive pattern.  Despite the opulence of the production, none of this makes any sense-- at most, the script should have been labelled "rough notes for a future screenplay."  Despite the impressive cast for his sequel movie, GIDEON'S DAUGHTER, including Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson and Robert Lindsay, I shall abstain. 
      Overall, I was not impressed by this rambling and disjointed book although Ferguson makes some interesting points. The book is background to a British TV series involving Ferguson, and it suffers very much from being written for that format.      His basic argument is that the great wars of the 20th Century tore apart the great multi-ethnic empires of Great Britain, Russia, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, and Germany, unleashed ethnic tensions the empires had contained. This, he explains, is the reason for a lot of the violence of the century, as new nation states sorted out their ethnic identities with large-scale organized violence following.      This is, indeed, a very fertile field and Ferguson unearths the mass graves with relish. We are presented with the familiar parade of horribles -- Kaiser Bill, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc., and a huge section on the pogroms against the Jews in central Europe and the Nazi extermination efforts. The narrative tends to jump around quite a bit, something I would attribute to the TV format of keeping viewers interested, but it's a little disconcerting for armchair readers.      But in the end, Ferguson is unconvincing. I don't think he has fully thought through his thesis here. Unexplored is the question of why some 20th Century wars of liberation, for example Ireland's, had low death rates, while the establishment of others like Turkey were so murderous. There were bitter ancient ethnic and religious issues in both Ireland and Turkey, and yet both took different routes. Also ignored are instances where threatened ethnic wars were largely averted, as in the case of Canada after the British Empire collapsed, and Indonesia after the Dutch withdrew.      I found him also fighting a straw man. He beats down the theory that the wars involved class conflict, and insists ethnic divisions are more significant in explaining the carnage than class. Perhaps Soviet historians presented this view, but I thought 1989 resolved the debate about Marxist interpretations of history.      Which brings up a final point. Ferguson muses about why the last decade of the 20th Century should be so quiet, compared to all that happened. I might think that the collapse of the Soviet empire resolved the last issue of the wars of the 20th Century by declaring another big loser.             
 I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.   Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.  Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 Yes, President Bush is a rebel.  He rebels against the people of the United States and the Constitution.  Here are just a few examples of his rebellious ways:  1.   He turned a record surplus into a record deficit.  2.   He cuts benefits to the poor in order to fund obscene tax cuts to the rich.  3.   He manipulated and cherry-picked intelligence data in order to rationalize starting an immoral and unjust war.  4.   He lied to the American people about the reasons for starting that war.  5.   He allowed America's real enemies to escape justice in order to pursue his own selfish and unrealistic goals.  6.   He refuses to acknowledge the reality of the consequences of America's (and the world's) dependence on fossil fuels.  7.   He defies the Constitution of the United States by ordering the illegal spying of Americans and the torture of prisoners who are being held indefinitely without being charged.  Nearly 150 years ago our fore-fathers fought a Civil War to stop the rebels in this country who rejected our Constitution.  Now we have a President in the White House who basks in his rebel status and thumbs his nose at those who dare to challenge him.  Meanwhile, authors like Fred Barnes praise his rebelliousness, and millions of Americans rejoice in their self-proclaimed righteousness because it happens to coincide with their president's, and millions more simply stand passively mute. 
 this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls "Monalisa", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her.  The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well. Very disappointed...  It would have been a good book had it been only 200 pages long.  Sorry Suketu! 
 I'm not all that familiar with Kellerman's work since I try to stay clear of serial character novels. But my wife, a Kellerman fan, bought the book and suggested I read it.  While the pace was mostly okay, two things really bothered me about this book. First is that the author is obsessed with wardrobe. He feels the need to exhaustively describe what many characters wear in each scene down to the last stitch! But the thing that I was most unhappy with is that Kellerman does what I don't recall seeing an author ever do. He walks away from the book. Just ends it with no conclusion! It's as if he decided he wrote the required amount of pages and said, "Well, that's it!" and sent it off to the publisher. Two big no-no's for a writer 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 the writer is writing the book about himself hoping to have the reader to benefit out of his own history... it is not the case really.  to start with, the language is not good at al. when it comes to chess the writer is like pouring though chunks here and there 
 We viewers have been innundated with gay hustler movies lately, to the point where it's becoming a cliche. What is the endless fascination? Frankly, I'm sick of them. That said, I have to admit that I had a bit of a bias against this movie from the start. This movie did nothing to break out of the gay hustler cliche. The acting is pretty good (except for the whiny, cursing models) and pretty good-looking but the dialog is unbelievably bad. It pivots from soap opera exchanges to allegedly funny one-liners, although I did chuckle at the stuck elevator scene. Sad that some seemingly talented actors couldn't have been some better dialog. The plot has no real story arc or climax. It just sort of meanders from one scene to another without any real direction. The characterizations are pretty sloppy, too.  Ian is pretty well-developed but the screenwriter doesn't seem to know where he's going with Conrad.  Is Conrad a jerk?  Are we supposed to feel sympathy toward him because of his recent breakup? He comes across as petty and vindictive (the blanket incident described in the elevator) and that's a dangerous position to place a major character in. In any movie or story, if you have an unlikeable character as a lead, you'd better make sure s/he has some redeeming quality.  And Conrad has none.  Some of the minor characters are irritating, too: Emily and Ted although the grandfather was one of the bright spots of the movie. In the end, the movie never really answers the question posed in its tagline: "What are you worth?"  It would have been a much better movie if it did.  
 Amazon, I wasted a lot my time writing a long truthful review of these scam artists and you never put it up and never even got back to me. Never again, you have the courtesy of a dead fish! I followed your guidelines and there was nothing there in your list of "What not to include".  ***Added 11-18-06  I was approached by these people and yes it is true, you must contribute a huge amount of money. It goes towards a large amount of the publishing/printing fees and to get "published" you must pay it.  I have been published many times and I was either paid for my work or I did it just for the exposure. I never had to put out a single penny.  The scams like these are too many to count. It is basically a way for someone who can't get there work published, usually for lack of talent, another avenue by paying to have it published.  If you're looking to view works of talent then this is in my opinion definitely not the book for you. It is not art and the so called artists are masters of nothing, especially talent.  It's more like "pay to play".  Gary Darrar Photographer     
 We know Rita Mae can write.  I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried.  She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously.  This book however shows none of that talent.  Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic 
 Published in the early 1990s, this book puts forth the thesis that the end of the Cold War, and its victory by the US, marked a significant turning point in history.  Specifically, mankind can see the light at the end of the tunnel of history, that the liberal democracy that is America at the end of the Cold War is pretty close to a perfect society and once every society reaches this stage, mankind has reached the end of history.  No more wars, no more revolutions, no more upheavals, etc, etc.  Of course, events in the next decade up to and after the 9-11/2001 terrorist attacks proved this book all wrong.  Mankind is nowhere near the end of history; in fact we might be staring at a very long war between established governments and multinational terrorist groups.  And the dot.com bust, the Enron and related scandals, and now the economic and social wreckage due to a summer's worth of hurricanes shows that liberal democracies like the US are not even close to being optimal societies in terms of managing people - people or people - nature relationships.  I believe this book is even more foolish; that its thesis and its premise was flawed even in 1993, and that the author should have known better than to publish such bullcrap.    First, the human population continues to grow.  Yet the amount of arable land and drinkable water is not increasing.  This can only lead to conflicts.  It led to conflicts in the past, and will only lead to more conflicts in the future.  We are seeing it happen already; every year the SW states in the USA duke it out in courts over water access.  Every year the Jews and Palestinians in Israel bicker over water access.  And of course we have at least one war per decade over oil; whether it be in the Middle East or somewhere else.  As the world's population grows, we are only going to have more wars, and since wars make great history, a lot more history to go thru.  Second, the author's premise that America is a liberal democracy is totally false.  America is a corporate democracy.  Pull over 100 people on any American city street (D.C. excepted) and ask them who their congressmen is, or who their state representative is, or even who their mayor is, and after a slight pause, the most common answer would be "I DO NOT KNOW".  On the other hand, ask him/her how their 401K is doing, or how is their mutual fund performing, and you will get a certain answer.  This discrepancy of awareness and involvement between civic society and the corporate world can only mean one thing; America is a corporate democracy.  An even more potent sign; many of the prisons, schools, and health care facilities in the US are increasingly run in part or in whole by corporations.  Three of the most fundamental aspects of any society; criminal punishment, health care, and education, are run by corporations in the US.  Third, democracies don't always last.  A Roman Republic over 300 years old converted to dictatorship in under a century.  The area that is now Poland was comprised of democratic states throughout the Middle Ages.  These were successively conquered by their bigger neighbors (France, Germany, Russia) and subjected to dictatorships.  The Native American tribes throughout the N. American continent were all democracies in the purest sense of the word.  From 1776 - 1910, each and every single one of them was either destroyed, displaced, or absorbed by one nation that only allowed white males to rule; the USA.  Last, in any given time period, the democratic nations that exist are usually expanding their possessions, usually be conquering less democratic nations.  Semi-democratic, aristocratic England conquered the Middle East and India.  Democratic France conquered N. Africa.  And of course the US has defeated or taken over various countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, all of which were less democratic than the US.  Democracy does not put an end to man's greed, it only channels it outwards towards its neighbors near and far.  All in all, a book of false conclusions based on false premises.  It is worthy of reading if only to see the mistakes in its logic and arguments 
 The ideas in this book are good so don't get me wrong...but I don't know how many women today could just sit back and smile and make happy while, for example, their husband is off with another woman waiting for him to see how much better things would be back at home.  I believe the husband is the head of the household but I can't believe that God intends for a "submissive wife" to allow her husband that is committing adultry to continue to live in their house, sleep in their bed, and be an example for their children 
 I have read most of the books by Ambrose and the material in The Victors is covered better in his other works.  It isn;t bad, but the only reader who might find it interesting is someone who was looking to get into Ambrose's WWII works.  Anyone else but the completists will probably not enjoy this book 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I just bought this movie recently, and was disappointed with the results. I don't recall the amount of guys there was for the photo shoots, but the only decent looking one was billy, and he was the very last athlete.  Not what I call a good buy. Don't bother with buying this one. Next! 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 I did not like this craphead book at all. I was not excited to pick it up and could not find myself getting hooked in its non-existant story line. The characters were unrealistic and undeveloped. Is"Kit" a good guy or a bad guy? You just can't root for him throughout the story because he is just an unfinished sketch on a chewed up piece of paper. 
 I agree that this book stinks,  but actually it's average, as far as the books I can find. I'm an older student with a mere associates in AC/DC/Digital electronics, so I have a modest math background; and I haven't done math in over 20 years. I'm now taking calc II for the first time and I see quite clearly why America's math scores are trailing many other nations. Our math I.Q is being murdered by instructors who write books that give incomplete examples and test outside of what they've taught in the guise of rigor, and assume we're 19 and learn in only one style, and we're getting lectures every week to fill-in the voids. This is very frustrating and observation tells me that this has ruined further interest for many. I'll find a better book or teacher.  Now the first 5 chapters are far better, they seemed more complete, after chapter 6 it seems a different writing and presentation style. Where I need more graphics and step by step details where my algebra or understanding is perhaps lacking.   Now you math teachers will likely respond with the old saw,,, `the discipline requires...' well if you came to me seeking instruction in the martial arts, could I in good conscience say that I left out fundamental steps or review so that you might gain some insight? or you should know this/that? in every example?  Now mind you, your teeth and limbs can only be replaced, with inferior imitations.   How many books/online tutorials with the same examples do we need?with numerous mistakes!!  and that solutions? !manual!, call it an answer manual or hint guide, you could have the first examples review or point to pivotal details or examples on-line; but alas those online tutorials mostly make the very same assumptions and are just as lacking, when the only limitation on-line is vision and perspective.  Yes perspective, why write redundant books for the top 10%? When the U.S is quickly losing ground in the global economy and fewer are math/science literate.  Hey,,, some of us learn differently!!! We're musical or visual? Or hands on.  We may not be Newton or Bernoulli material but sell us a book worth the time and effort! or Teach us Mandarin and Hindi.   Good day! 
 When I saw the movie, it was so predictable. Halfway into it, the broadcasts were so lame as well as the so-called live-footage. Total rip-off of "War of the Worlds." Reminded me  of an NBC-TV movie from the early 80's called, "Special Bulletin." Much better with it's live-broadcasts! The only  thing i liked about this movie, when I switched back to catch it's climax ending. They never even saw their ever-ending doom. Sure put's the military in it's place!  
 This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer.  His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South.  He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's 
 Every book by Jodi Picoult grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go. Mercy stands out from all the rest. You will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time 
 This book was a disappointing waste of time and money. The author's introduction is a story of a man who was flunking out of law school.  He speaks of his early failures in comedy and then says he eventually began to study comedians he liked.  He writes of a very elementary analytical process he used to find what made each of his favorite comedians funny.  The analysis is one anyone could easily put together and there is no need to buy this book for this insight.  As the author continues, he gives advice on how to put together material.  He tells us to work on timing and delivery and recommends studding your favorite comedians to best learn this aspect.  All and all, there were fewer than 50 pages of the afore mentioned.  After that, there are interviews with several comedians that although are interesting, do not provide much help in developing yourself as a comic. In short, if you're looking for a few short interviews with a few comics, you'll like this book.  If you're looking for someone to help you learn to write your own stuff, the core of the few pages in this book is (1) Study your favorite comic (2) Tap into your own life experiences. (3) Use your "third eye" (whatever that means)..... 
 Lonely Hearts has numerous inaccuracies that I am aware of, a clear result of the author not reading first-hand sources 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 I am not indicting his theories, but his writing. My God. Buy "Fabric of the Cosmos" by Brian Greene. It covers the same thing (and much more) in a more eloquent and comprehensive manner. Do not buy 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 A crashing disappointment. Despite the hype of using Welles' "original screenplay", it is evident that director Arau was determined to avoid any hint of Welles' inspired narrative & cinematography. Result: bland city throughout. At 1/10 the budget, Welles 1942 film achieved ten times the artistry in 88 minutes vs. A&E's nominal four hours 
 The Causey Book is outdated.  The information included is available online in a more professional format.  A good internet browser will get you more information than this book 
 After of a long period without seeing my DVD copy, I was alerted by a friend that his copy was oxidized. And so was mine. What to do? In my DVD collection ONLY this one is damaged!!!  I like Kylie and this wonderful collection wich deserves lots of stars + starKyle 
 I hated this book alot. Miriam made the Indians seem disgusting and barbaric. She kept talking about how bad the Indians were and blaming her family for being captured, I really thought it was dull 
 This is a sad attempt at modern science fiction.  I was appalled by the lack of continuity and the plotting errors.  Remainder Bin here I come 
 Did I miss something?  I read every word, and found it all a big yawn.   The writing is grammatically correct, but without any rhythm, not a single  crescendo, completely devoid of climax.  Rachel Carson?  Please.  I  couldn't find a single hook in the anecdotes, not a compelling story  within.  Time after time, the stories and examples fell completely flat.   Organizationally, the writer skipped around paragraph to paragraph without  carrying any thought through a full chapter.  The science was minimal at  best, and just plain questionable at times.  How did such a good premise  turn out so dull?  And what really got me was that I love the Outer Banks.   Do yourself a favor; a textbook on wind will be more compelling 
 I cannont people have the audacity to rate this movie with full stars!! The only good thing this movie is good for is pure hysterical boredom. If you're a fan of really, REALLY bad acting... this is the movie for you. I have watched it about 5 times,usually while feeling irie, because it is simply made for laughter. The best part is when that redhead is caught puking in the bathroom, oh my goodness...can someone please HELP that pathetic woman?  Truthfully, one of my favorite movies of all time, simply because it's so terrible that I can't believe it's real 
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 Not really worth watching if you read the book. Do yourself a favor and read the book. 
 The product is what I expected, and the price was good for the advertised quantity.  However, the packers at Amazon must have misunderstood the quantity description, or possibly the description was truncated.  I was supposed to receive a pack of 3 packages.  Each package has 2 cartridges.  The packers sent me only two packages in the shipping container.  Also, the packing slip did not include a customer service phone number 
 I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book.  It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book.  The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.  To end in a cliche way, "I still haven't found what I am looking for" 
 I purchased this DVD thinking it was going to help me and my boyfriend since it got such great reviews. I agree how this DVD had a low budget appearance and that most of it was spent with this guy talking to you. It's not as if the stuff he mentioned were things I've never heard of before. I was expecting more visuals than verbal. I hope that Amazon gives me more than a partial credit since I didn't bother watching the rest and just immediately returned it 
 This started out as a good story filled with mystery and intrigue.  A little over halfway through when I expected it to really start getting good, it died.  This story dove faster than the P-47 in the opening.  The second half of the story waned and the ending had no closure. I hope future novels by these authors will learn by these shortcomings 
 The book had so much promise, but I find it to be disappointing in several ways, alas.  The recipes I've tried have been delicious, and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative, although the discussions and instructions don't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool, as would, for example, anything by Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Jacques Pepin, or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks, all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes.  In this case, I was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before I bought the book.  Were I a tyro, I don't think this book would be the best introduction, although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying.  My biggest disappointment, though, is the organization of the book:  ice cream recipes are "bundled" with their accompanying cookies, garnishes, and the like; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream, for example, we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches, with ice cream of any of several different flavor families.  One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find, say, recipes for chocolate ice cream.  I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes, by flavor and page number, right up front -- I don't want to spend so much time looking for the flavor I want.    My next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color.  My middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book, even with my reading glasses on, and I surely can't prop the book 18-20" back from my utensils, to read as I work without changing position, as I like to do with my cookbooks.  This is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen (admittedly very attractive) style over function.  The book IS very attractive, and the photographs are lovely -- but I would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily.  My final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the "dessert packages," for lack of a better word.  Making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is, in most cases, a tremendously labor-intensive exercise.  I have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments.  I work a demanding job and have a house to run.  I love to cook, but can't devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich, for example, as these recipes require.  So I use less of the book than I'd wish.  Over all, Ms. Luchetti's sense of style and taste are impressive, and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts.  And many of the ice cream recipes are lovely.  But I had hoped that this would be a book I would pull from the shelf much more often than I will, in fact, because the book is so difficult to use 
 Elementary graphics stuff. Beginner material about how games came to be - and are. An acceptable resource for developing 2D games (sans programming), though the 3D part is pretty dated 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized XBox controller, these cables are worthless 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed 
 When it is all said and done about Clinton's Legacy, Gene Lyons has assured himself a place in the Presidential Library by writing such a book. The book does point out several areas that Clinton haters seldom want to  see or believe. For example, regardless how you feel about Bill, you must  admire his ability to not only survive a sad, sordid and disadvantage  childhood but achieved his goals in education, public service and politics.  He did so on his own initiative, using and abusing close friends who also  did the same to him, and focusing on saying anything at anytime that could  help him at that time. Whitewater was a shady inside financial political  deal, made among many politicians with profiteers when the Saving and Loan  sector was deregulated, not just in Arkansas but throughout the country. It  was denied during the campaign and avoided by a phony accounting report  that was needed in the primaries, but proved to be less than accurate after  Clinton was elected president. On one hand, two of Clinton's friends became  upset when the deal went south and felt Clinton abandoned them when he  became president. Now did those friends feel betrayed by Clinton and wanted  to bring him down as the book points out? The author has made a great case  saying so and I believe him. On the other hand, was it the silence of  others who refused to answer pivotal questions whether such meetings with  Clinton took place? This would lead back to the president when he was a  governor and would show he plotted and scheme with them? No doubt about it,  their silence saved this president. Therefore, in the book Gene Lyons wants  us to believe the former but some facts clearly show an investigation was  needed and reported properly by the media contrary to the author's  CONclusions. Either way, 17 convictions including the Solicitor General's  convictions are facts not fiction. The author has been trying to apologize  and justify Clinton's behavior since the impeachment. In the end, no book  using revisionists history is going to exonerate this president's actions  prior to and during the first four years of his presidency that  accomplished more than people expected. At the same time, no book can  change the fact that president Clinton was able to avoid impeachment for  many acts that even his party said can be punishable after these last four  years of absolutely few accomplishments whatsoever. No friend or enemy of  the Clintons' have been able to help or hurt the Clintons' more so than  themselves as well as this book that lives off of a public's poor memory.  The only problem is, when you view the Clinton presidency even after  Whitewater, it is one few can be proud of and the only fool is the one who  claims it had made up scandals to bring them down. Sorry, they did it all  by themselves and still are doing it, to the dismay of the many who support  them, and frustration of those would destroy them. The book is worth  reading to provide an overall view of the Clintons' but it can't change  history 
 For a real CFO, this one is actually too heavy to read through. As for the practician, although graced with beautiful charts and diagrams, it ain't provide any real beef, either. It is a sample of "anything about nothing and nothing about anything". Vague 
 I can't help but feel that the reviews thus far for this book have only been favorable due to the contributions that Dawkins himself has made to the field of evolutionary biology.    What was most troubling about this book was the contradictions which the editors themselves (Grafen and Ridley) managed to incorporate.  They say that Dawkins uses "impeccable logic" and yet they also claim that he's "often misunderstood".  Grafen claims that The Selfish Gene caused an "immediate revolution in biology".  Yet, Andrew Read, one of the contributors, said he didn't encounter the book until after he completed his four year zoology degree (and yes, it had been published before that time).  One also gets to read about, from the accounts of several scientists, how The Selfish Gene "taught me to think" (from Read's essay, but this is only an example).  Grafen then tells us that it is noteworthy that Dawkins was elected to the Royal Society for his "contributions to the public understanding of science, not for his contribution to science itself."  The Selfish Gene is a masterful book and it's certainly worthy of praise, but 283 pages of praise with intercalary superfluous biographic accounts by the authors makes this book one for the trash bin.  It is nothing but an academic circle jerk.  Very disappointing 
 If these two men were so intelligent and had such insight, why did they waste their time on a game of trivial pursuit?  They fully beleived they knew all and had the final sayso on  everything. They also were not sure they wanted to share this info with just anyone except to write a book and cash in on their 'secret knowledge'. 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 A PRINCESS AND 8 SAMURAIS BATTLE THE HIKIMA CLAN. THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS 
 Two comments of his, one about Hinduism and one about Buddhism's fate in India, will illustrate these two points.  Calling Hinduism monotheistic is pure bullheaded willfulness, shoehorning to fit a preconceived theory. THe further south/nonAryan one goes in India, the dichotomy between the normally feminine household/village deities and the "received Hindu hierarchy" alone shows just how wrong this is.  The idea that Buddhism died out in India because it was too intellectual and did not offer a satisfying deity ignores several facts.  First is the Mahayana/Theravada division of Buddhism, developing in and around India long before Buddhism lost its position at the top in India. The division arguably weakened Buddhism in the face of a resurgant Hinduism, not to mention showing the metaphysical diversity of Buddhism already arising..  Which leads to the fact that Stark ignores a resurgent, indeed reformed, Hinduism as the primary reason Buddhism did not remain in India. Given the amount of pages he has written on Christian history, he should have easily seen analogies to the Catholic Counter-Reformation, but either failed to or chose not to.  Remember, or know, two simple facts about Stark before you read any of his books.  1. His academic training is as a sociologist; he is neither a trained historian nor a trained scholar of comparative religion.  2. When he leaves his academic speciality, he invariably makes some sort of right turn straight into evangelical Christian apologetics. (He now teaches at Baylor.) Every book he has written has at least some degree of that stamped on it 
 This may well be one of the worst books ever.  Totally unbelievable plot line, bad characters, bad dialog ... don't waste your time with this stinker 
 I had really high hopes for this book and was really looking forward to reading it.  I'm glad that I paid a dollar for it used because my money would have been wasted at much more than that.  Let me start by saying that I admire Lauren.  She had the courage and will to survive a situation that myself and most others would not have.  That being said, the way this story was told was just not interesting enough to take up an entire book.  I found the first half of the book to be very tedious reading; I really had to force myself to keep going.  I think that was because the first half was mostly about what was going on in Greg's life.  Since Lauren was in a coma, there wasn't much for him to say about her so his emails are filled with extremely long detailed narratives on his son, his band, the Yankees and his feelings on 9/11.  I suppose this kind of information might be interesting to friends and family, but I found it mostly boring to hear about the kind of food served at his child's birthday party and to hear in detail about each person he talked to every single day.      The second half of the book was better as Lauren woke up and the emails focus much more on her and her recovery.  Since this was what I wanted and was expecting from this book, I found this part to be a much more enjoyable read.     As other reviewers have noted, the Mannings live a much more wealthy lifestyle than most Americans.  I don't have a problem with this, but I just couldn't relate to them or their lives very well.  I think I would have enjoyed the book a lot more if the Mannings were more like the rest of us.  The only real struggle in the book was Lauren's physical recovery; the Mannings didn't have trouble paying the bills, had nannies to take care of their child, and Greg was able to take several months off work with no difficulty at all.  To me, these everyday struggles would have made this story far more interesting.  It also would have been interesting to hear from Lauren and Lauren's family more; all we ever heard was Greg's point of view on everything.  I would recommend this book only to the Manning's friends and family, to people who lost loved ones on 9/11, and those looking for information on the recovery process of burn survivors.  For everyone else, you may or may not find this book interesting enough to finish.  If you feel you want to go ahead and read it, consider picking it up at the library or buying it used. 
 My thanks to Mr. Guare.  Had he not portrayed the rich as fatuous dupes, I might still envy them 
 this book is the devil! i am using it in a lit studies course and loathe every second i waste reading these essays. they seem to be written mostly by stuffy university professors who are attempting to sound like they know what they are talking about.  It is not a dictionary, nor does it help the reader properly understand a term.  If you are curious about a word that is discussed in the book, i suggest looking it up in the dictionary.  it's easier. and you'll actually learn what the word means without having to search through thick sentences that really make no sense and large words that you know the author just pulled out of a thesauraus 
 I was disappointed with this book: it glossed over many parts of modern computing history to focus on the odd-balls, the unpleasant and the just plain nerdy. The focus appeared to be on MIT SAIL and the early game coding shops.  One could be forgiven, if on reading this volume, for believing that micro-computing only happened in the USA on the West Coast. The definitive hacker/PC history is yet to be written.. 
 Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned 
 I was curious to read what all the fuss was about after reading so many sterling reviews here, but I found this book to be just another mish-mash of current trendy ideas in the fitness world.  Most of this information has been around for 50-100 years, before steroid bloated "bodybuilders" and the comic magazines that eulogize them destroyed any resemblance to common sense and reality about working out with weights.  The beginner may get a few good bits of information and will probably make some muscle gains - as most beginners do on just about ANY program, but the experienced lifter he or she will soon be looking elsewhere for routines that will give results.  Schuler states in the book that the reader should not necessarily look at a trainer's body or state of fitness to judge if what he is teaching is valid or if he has real knowledge of how to train and therefore how to train others - and when I looked at the photos of him and Cosgrove I could see why he made this disclaimer.  They may be fit (depending on your interpretation of "fit") but they are not much to look at.  Personally I do think that if someone talks the talk he should be able to walk the walk.  Schuler acts like he and Cosgrove - I guess due to their brilliance and number of trainers certificates - just discovered that multi-joint compound movements are the best even though this has been known since the early 1900's.  Schuler also relates how he tried the squat once and then didn't perform the movement again for 12 years and yet he was a writer for "Men's Fitness"?  Sorry, but any weightlifting/fitness instructor should know that the squat and deadlift, military press, chins and dips (and to a much lesser extent the bench press) are the cornerstones of any good routine!  When I first started lifting 30 years ago I went to the library and found a beginners book that taught me to Squat, Deadlift, and Press - and the book was written in the 60's!  In fact that book would be more useful for any aspiring weight-trainee that this one.  As for the various programs in the book, good luck to anyone who attempts to follow them for the 52 week period outlined.  Most of them will quickly lead to over-training for the majority of trainees not using steroids.  I got the impression that the routines are formulated based on a conglomeration of various training techniques as espoused by West Side, Russian "Secrets", latest "weight-loss" fads, etc.  Hey, this looks good let's throw it in!  Also, there is one major flaw in these programs - the amount of weight one  should be lifting for the stated number of reps has been conveniently omitted.  Prescribing 6 sets of 3,2,1,3,2,1 reps is fine but is this with the same weight for each set or should the weight be increased?  Oops!  I think the reason you are seeing 5-star ratings for this book is because so many cookie-cutter certified trainers who work at a fern and juice-bar spa, have trained with weights for 6 months or so, and now are "experts" and "qualified" to train others, have very little concept of how to effectively train with weights, so they read a book like this and it provides them with information they have not been exposed to before, whereas anyone who has taken the time to do real research into weight training methodology or has been fortunate enough to join a real weight lifting gym rather than a fern and juice-bar spa, will already know that full-body programs based around the multi-joint, compound movements are the way to go.  Any serious weight-trainee would be much better served reading books by Bill Starr (mentioned in this book), Stuart McRobert, Perry Rader, and some of the old-timers who developed tremendous physiques and strength without "scientific knowledge" so highly thought of today.  After a year or so The New Rules of Lifting will become the "Out-Dated" Rules of Lifting as writers like Schuler/Cosgrove will contradict almost everything in the book with the latest, greatest "trends" of fitness.  Why?  Well, in order to sell more books of course 
 Ooh this is so innovative! Cr a p py wi g g e r music that sounds like EVERY FU C KING THING OUT THERE!!! This loser is the biggest wi g g e r since Fred Durst and Eminem! I mean come on how could this get a 3.5 average?! Stuff by D4L, Chingy, and 50 Cent get low averages so why can't this?! "Ms. New Booty" has to be the most unoriginal song out there and the beat in "Heat it Up" is super annoying. This guys voice just sounds so tired and bored! This is music for stupid people and no one else. If you're smart you would listen to a band like Queensryche or Dream Theater that rocks, not this sh i t 
 Rarely have I felt ripped off after reading a book, but Konstantinos managed to make me feel that way.  What he offers in this book is a pseudo-scientific approach to the topic of vampires, one that reads like a high school paper that I doubt would garner a C.  He starts off by redefining the term vampire, one that in common parlance refers to an immortal blood drinker who can't face the sunlight or get destroyed, to include mortals who drink blood. I don't know about you, but as for me, a human who drinks blood is someone who I would not label as "vampire" but as "in need of some professional counselling."   Later he presents letters from what he describes as "possible vampires". Several of those letters are from individuals who profess to being mortal, eating (yes, garlic too), and only having a spoonful of blood occasionally because 'they need it'. When a letter like this comes from what sounds like a deeply disturbed teen then I wouldn't present it as "a letter from a possible vampire", but toss it in the recycle bin. When a person presents himself in one of those letters as being a vampire and in the next breath claim not to experience any harm from sunlight, and seeing his reflection in the mirror, and not needing blood to survive--you'd say Konstantinos would have had the common sense to not include a letter like that, but no.   So, those letters offer as far as I am concerned nothing that indicates that vampires actually exist, and everything that indicates that some people responded to Konstantinos's add, one that requested vampires to send letters to him and tell about themselves, in order to have some fun and see if they could fool Konstantinos. Maybe they fooled him, or maybe it was Konstantinos who fooled us, the readers. I am inclined to believe that the first is possible since his entire presentation has "immature" all over it. Then again, the possibility exists that he simply saw a way to make an easy buck. Regardless of whether or not Konstantinos was sincere in his attempt to proof that vampires exist, in my eyes he failed thoroughly and lost all credibility in the process. I'll make certain to stay away from his other books.  
 We've owned this toaster for 2 years now.  Because it's lasted that long and due to it's appealing looks, we give it the 2 stars.  As for using it for toasting, it rates very poorly.  The toast darkness control is unreliable.  Leave it in one place and get light toast at one time and dark the next.  It has a silly mechanism that supposedly allows for better control when toasting bagels or muffins.  The control is useless.  The worst part of the machine, however, is that it is nearly impossible to retrieve the toast, bagel, whatever, without getting burned.  More than once we've been forced to turn the toaster upside down to get our breakfast (toast and millions of crumbs).  Buy it for it's looks, look elsewhere for making toast.  
 The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short.  But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published.  I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book 
 Yet another coffee table picture book on the current styling trends of Choppers. Mr. Seate's excellent previous book, 'Choppers' touched on the origin of these great machines and then went on to showcase the current trends. Instead of this new book delving deeper into actual hand built outlaw machines from the glory days of the late 60's and 70's and the home built bikes of today, it also focuses on modern, big dollar builders. Some of the bikes featured such as the BMC bikes may be nice machines but they are production bikes and shouldn't be included here. The Bobber section does have some nice rides and Chica's stuff is pretty cool but you can find bikes like these in any current Harley biased custom magazine. The title suggests that you're going to see real outlaw choppers but this is just another attempt at cashing in on the current TV driven fad. Real chopper fans may be dissapointed 
 I didn't learn much from this book, and I don't think it was just me.  I'm afraid it is one of those books written by knowledgeable people for a general audience, without much understanding of who are in that audience or what they might want to know.  Example:  "Rumble is very low-frequency noise caused by acoustic feedback, tone arm resonance, motor vibration, and other problems in a turntable."  How many readers need to know what "rumble" means but already know about "acoustic feedback" and "tone arm resonance"?  And what are they meant to do with the information?  The discussion ends there.  Sorry to have to contradict the generally good reviews.  I notice, though, that they are mainly from other wizards who think somebody might benefit from the book -- not from people who actually have. 
 I was tod to watch this film from a co-worker and I was jsut dissapointed. I could not believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching this trash. The story was very confusing with it going back and fourth through time. There are many pointless storylines and charactors. The acting is overdone that it's not believable. I like the actors in the film but they where jsit placed in the wrong movie 
 I bought this book since I went to Lehigh and thought it would be extra interesting because of my background and because I played soccer and ice hockey at college.  What a let-down! I found the game by game annayasis drawn out and boring.  About the only thing I can recommend to you from the book is the "amaterism" ( if there is such a word) of college sports at Lehigh and the great majority of other colleges in the US that we do not read or hear about on a daily basis.  I see you can purchase a used copy on Amazon for $0.99 - so what the hell - for a buck it's worth it I guess 
 good movie, bad copy!  I ordered it because it was cheap.  However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.  It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.  The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
 I guess that I should know better.  Most of the "for Dummies" have too much useless information and are not organized in manner that is conducive to find the answer to a problem 
  I decided to read Blue Latitudes after reading a review from an Amazon "Rate It" patron. It suggested that Blue Latitude was a far more superior book than Over the Edge of the World. Since I thought OVTEOTW was one of the best books I ever read, I'll give BL a read;the longest chore I had to endure this year. Spare yourself 
 I am studying anthropological courses in the university and bought the encyclopedia to help and guide me through the new terms I encountered. For these purposes I found this book extremely unhelpful. This is definitely not a book for students, those who start studying anthropology, but rather for those who already know a lot about the science.  For example, here is the definition of essentialism:  "Essentialism commonly appears as both a violation of anthropological relativism and one of the besetting conceptual sins of anthropology. Exemplified by such totalizing ideologies as nationalims and biological determinism, it is also frequently conflated with reification, objectivism and literalism". Etc.  For me in order to understand this definition, I need to read 3-4 page articles in the same encyclopedia about: relativism, biological determinism, objectivism, literalism. And even after that I don't think I will be able to understand what the authors wanted to say by this definition. And its the same almost about every other term or concept I was looking up.   Of course, if you are familiar with all these terms - it is easy, but then do you really need this encyclopedia.  A frustrating experience for me. This publication is collecting dust on a shelf now, and I turned to more popular publications, like "What is anthropology" (terms are explained in a much more accessible language), "Understanding social and cultural anthropology", etc. And... never underestimate wikipedia, the best for me as a student.  Would strongly not recommmend this book for students and whoever is starting to learn anthropology. Will advise it to my anthropology university professor with 20 years teaching experience, he may find it interesting.  Ma 
 The discusions of mercury, fluoride etc. are satisfactory, but this book pushes the preposterous Electro-dermal screening. A.k.a Electo-accupuncture According to Voll (EAV): Voll,  a German scientist who researched in the 50's, but the research has never been verified or validated. EAV is a  used by naturopaths and homeopaths without any scientific backing, that, as a homepathic dentist, I'm aware of. 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 WOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THIS!!!!!!!!!!! That is unbelievable. I would seriously be just as embarrassed to be caught anywhere near this as I would with a Barney DVD. Im serious, I kinda cant help but think tyheres something wrong with the teens that listen to this stuff. i meen I guess I understand if your a teenage girl or something, but I can't imagine why a male older than the age of 11 would listen to this? Look this isn't an insult, its a cry for help.   
 The content is full of valuable information on selling. But this Audio CD is not my favourite.   Ziglar speaks so rapidly and non-stop! I guess nobody speaks in this mannner.  I mean, if you want listeners to enjoy your speech, it is better to  speak in a more natural pace, occassionally there should be a pause.    Ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this CD. Choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever! Slow down Slow down......... Ziglar!  Give me some space to absorb your message!   I wish I can listen to your CD comfortably, but I can't.  You Read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works. Ziglar!   I am sorry, I have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this CD 
 I'm sorry folks, but I thought it was boring.  I know I fell asleep in the beginning of the afternoon one day while I was reading it.  Sure, the facts about the Navajo that the author researched, were researched very well.  And I had a sense that the Author was going to let me in on just how much he researched, even if most of what he had to say was very subtle.  I can take subtle from an author for just a short time, and then I go and look for a good Romance 
 I'm more used to a more rhythmic tempo from ATB. This wasn't what I had in mind when I was buying the cd. All tracks are rather slow and melancholy. Not rapid up beat melodies and songs at all. It's good to relax with I guess. If you like a slow, more mesmerizing kind of tunes then this is for you. Otherwise don't bother. 
 Our cats aren't into this at all.  The only use I've found is to add a little lining to the bottom of their transport and to put it on top of their heating pads on those cold, cold days when I actually turn the heating pad on.  The cats prefer comforters, blankets, carpets, cat houses, cat beds, our laps, etc. to this.  There is no benefit to having it.    Also, we have two cats. It's the right size for the smaller cat.  the bigger cat is a bit too big for it. 
 I've been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest "Evil" novel to be less then inspiring, or fun to read.   It does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues.  Our teaching was couched in conversation normally between Rafe and Isabel. We would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder/mystery portion of the book, and I would just be getting into the meat of the story, and then I would be derailed by "too much information."  This is not to say that I don't care for instuction and added background.  I do, but there is a time when it is just too much.  We unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story.  This was just an okay read.  There was plenty of suspense (who was doing all of the killing and why) but I just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline, as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel.  The relationship between Rafe and Isabel was rather confusing.  She spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues, and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially.    To be honest I did skim a few pages, but still, I was okay as far as not missing anything important.  This was not her strongest effort and if you are picking Ms. Hooper up for the first time I highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two "Evil" reads.  An author can't be on "top" all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better.  I'm really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature Bishop and his team, and hope that she is back on track as the author we love.

 The authors of this book are concerned. Americans aren't doing what they should.  Specifically, to paraphrase former president Bill Clinton, they're not spending their money right.  They value things they shouldn't.  They work too much.  They own too much.  They shop at evil big box stores like Wal-Mart.  So, with paternalistic concern in their hearts, they have written this book to warn us that we're in need of a correction.  The enemies they identify read like a laundry list of the Left's archetypal villians: wealthy merchants, credit card companies, and of course Ronald Reagan.  Along the way they disparage virtually every technological and economic innovation that has occured over the last 25 years.  Particularly sickening is the warm, fuzzy picture they paint of the "good old days" when most Americans bought their goods from locally owned stores.  I grew up in a town identical to the one they idolize in this book.  It sucked.  All of the stores were located around the downtown square.  They closed at six o'clock or earlier.  Wednesdays most didn't open at all; Sunday was dead.  Parking was extremely limited.  Lack of selection forced consumers to go from one shop to another, often in blistering summer heat or freezing winter temperatures.  Prices were high and selection limited.  Especially bitter are the memories I have of trying to find part-time work in these businesses while in high school.  Virtually all the owners had their kids filling what few jobs existed.  Being from a lower-income family I desperately needed to work to help my family out.  But I was unable to find anything in the stagnant local economy.  Then one day a Wal-Mart came to town. My mom took me there on a bright Saturday morning.  She was ecstatic.  Here at last was a wide variety of goods she could afford.  She didn't have to hurry to get there before the store closed at dinner time.  As for me I landed a position with the store which allowed me to contribute to the family income as well as save for college.  Writers of books like this one love to talk about how merchandisers like Wal-Mart "steamroll" over Main Street.  Bulls***.  Stores like Wal-Mart don't put guns to anyone's head to gain them as customers.  Rather the local people look at Main Street with its inflated prices, inconvenient hours and parking and limited selection, and then at the new Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Home Depot or whatever, and freely choose how to best spend their money.  In other words they control the way their community works.  And no one seems to mind except for a handful of elitists living in faraway places who are upset that people would rather spend less of their hard-earned money than live the rest of their lives in a Norman Rockwell painting.    But I've saved the worst for last.  After wringing their hands for a couple hundred pages over the current state of prosperity in this country the authors outline their plan for "recovery."  Guess what it consists of?  Bingo!  Higher taxes and more government control.  They even pull that tired old cliche out of their rectums: "we must protect the children."  Not from sexual predators or terrorists, but from the local mall.    My response to this 300 or so pages of hysteria: get real.  This is the 21st century.  Modern technology and business innovation have given Americans marvelous new options for travel, work, leisure and, yes, consumption.  In other words, our society is evolving.  The local coffeehouse now has a Starbucks sign hanging in it.  Main Street is dead, replaced by a row of 24 hour big box stores.  Spending one's life hanging out with good ol' Bob and Joyce from down the block has been swept away by Internet chat rooms and social mobility.  Most of us are happy with this arrangement.  If you aren't then that's fine, but keep your damn noses out of our business.  I give this book two stars rather than one because they bring out a solitary point worth pondering: how corporations like McDonald's deliberately market to kids, even teaching them how to bilk money out of their parents.  Bravo for pointing this out!  But rather than Big Brother tackling this problem, how about parents grow spines, learn to say "no" and tell the companies they won't get another bloody dime until they amend their marketing practices?  That's a solution that goes unmentioned in this preachy, whiny, paternalistic volume.  In the end it's the individual, not the collective, that guides society.  Let's have more celebration of individualism and less of the socialistic nonsense our oh-so-concerned authors seek to impose on us - for our own good of course. 
 I must say I'm really bemused at the top reviews this score has received from some of the top soundtrack critics. I'm new to Desplat's music and was really expecting something quite special and enjoyable with this score after reading some of those reviews, however, I really don't see how this score can be regarded as anything other than often monotonous, passable underscore. I haven't seen the movie, and I can sense that the music would certainly be apt but I'm afraid that as a seperate listening experience, there is very little music here that could be described as memorable or impressive. 
    Just as in his book on Orson Welles, Thomson harbors an untoward lust to "get into the act" himself.  He is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen.      He apparently fancies himself a philosopher, so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento:   "In America we treasure shared things, as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered."  "Here, by the way, is a profound contradiction in much of Americana..."etc     He is, unsurprisingly, cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with "To be quick about this part of it, the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and in its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal."    HUAC's "campaign" itself sadly passed muster via  Congress' power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on, or grandstand about.  It was the methods that offended. HUAC "punishment" was indictment for contempt of congress. The judiciary did the rest on that score, dutifully seeing several into the slam. The blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of The (frightened) Studios.     Worst of all about this book is that, whenever he runs out of cheap, scurrilous, time-hallowed, dirt to re-publish, Thomson concocts bitchy dish "nouveau" of his own to serve up 
 I've read all of Michael Prescott's novels and loved them all except this one.  DANGEROUS GAMES was a major disappointment.  I hate having to admit it, but I found it so boring that I couldn't even finish it.    Hopefully his next one will be better.  
 Perhaps my expectations were set too high by the biography I read on Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson.  I found Unger's book on John Hancock easy to read, interesting, but lacking of facts and objectivity.  I got the impression that the author did not like any of the people involved in the American Revolution.  Is this author a Tory?   His descriptions of people and things were often shallow and repetitive.  For example...Unger used the description of a livered carriage with four horses for Hancock throughout the book many, many times, but does not describe once what this really means.  How many servants were working the carriage?  Were they slaves?  Were they in uniform?  If so, what colors?  How fancy?  The book does not describe in much detail the relationships Hancock has with other founders other than Sam Adams whom he paints extremely negatively.    Plus, Unger gets at least one important historical fact wrong.  Here's what I got from Isaacson's book:  John Hancock, declared at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, "There must be no pulling different ways.  We must all hang together."  To which, Ben Franklin replied, "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."  In Unger's book, he attributes the first quote to Franklin not Hancock and omits the second quote all together - which is the famous line!    It just seems to me the author was sloppy in research and lazy in writing this book.  If you can't find anything else about Hancock, then the information is interesting - I did find out that the Declaration was signed by one person - Hancock for the first month of its existence and that they created 13 originals - one for each state.  It's a very quick read, but don't rely on this book as the final answer on what went on during the Revolution 
 The pages of Men's Journal used to be an escapist   weekend getaway in themselves. They brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11. Since that time, MJ has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be, which might have been fine for one issue. This is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas 
 DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!  This mouse has given me nothing but frustration.  1. The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low, causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time.  2. Battery life is horrible. Like 2 weeks...  3. When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes, it goes into an automatic sleep mode. The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to "revive" it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen. So I have to reboot my computer.  Absolutely the worst!! 
 Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  "Get Your Hustle On" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  "I Know You Know" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  "Around The Way" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  "Sets Go Up" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single "Rodeo" is the millennium version of "Back That [...] Up" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  "What's Happenin'" is nothing to write home about, "Loose Booty" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and "Break A Brick Down" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. "Who's Ya Daddy" is pointless, along with the annoying "Keep Talkin'" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and "Why Not."  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on "Rock Like That."  The biggest shocker has to be "Addicted" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of "The Rain.")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come.  
 I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead.  What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.  I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing.  I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life 
 I dropped it in the pool once, and it never stoped running, eventually after the battery died from not shutting off, I replaced the batteries and it has never worked again.  My son loves this fish, he learned to say the word fish by playing with it all the time.... Too bad it didn't work!! 
 I bought this book and I have rated it with 2 stars only because it gives a very NARROW insight on Ian Curtis and offers a only few extra tidbits that you may not have already known about Ian Curtis or Joy Division, just a bit extra, most info you could find for free without buying the book.  The book is absolutely full of contradictions on her part. On the one hand he was an overbearing man who didnt let her wear makeup and told her to leave school and made her walk a long ways for lunch and she blames the band for helping him to cover up his affair, then on the other hand she says things to the effect that she would have done the same for a friend, the covering up the affair bit, and after all the bad-mouthing she does of him in the book, she ends by saying how fondly she remembers when they were young and loved each other.  Most importantly-she says she had already filed for divorce, so it was all about timing, you see. If he had killed himself any later on in that year she would be called Ian Curtis ex-wife, Deborah Woodruffe to this day, not the sad little WIDOW she is made out to be. He carried around pictures of his DOG rather than his wife and child for god's sake!!  Yeah,it has been years since his death, and I am not trying to be insensitive because I had a close friend who hung himself and left me with all of the same questions and regrets and sadness-but there are just so many hangers-on who will stop at nothing to continue to try and make money off of such a tragedy. I think it is sickening and I am quite disgusted, really.  The only person I really feel for, with all that I am, is Natalie Curtis. All she has left is what everyone tells her and I am sure she has heard a countless stories. Imagine trying to differentiate between them all. How sad. Don't take this as a resentment toward Deborah, I just know that Ian was a typical guy who watched/played football, drank beer, cheated on his wife, and people should stop trying to make money off the guy. Have you NO SHAME? If you want to buy the book, it's your choice 
 This is an extremely disappointing copy of 3 great original movies.  Looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old, used VHS tapes.  No wonder it's hard to find out who made this.  I wouldn't want to take credit for it, either.  Hard to enjoy in this poor format. My delivery took place in February, 2006 
 I wanted facts and how-to's, but this book is 99% a series of looks back at Hal Higdon's past (many of which I've read in other publications). Other than a few charts for running/walking/all combos of for full and half marathons, there's nothing in here to help the over 40 (or under 40, for that matter) runner progress. Very, very disappointing book. If it weren't for the hassles of returning things from Canada, this puppy would have gone back to amazon.com immediately. 
 This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.  
 I got this DVD as part of a set of Hallmark mini-series and hoped it would be as good as some of the others. The other mini-series were fantasy-based so unrealistic dialog worked just fine in them but this one was full of overly theatrical and unrealistic assertions which not only ruined the story by robbing it of any depth but also made it very difficult for the actors to perform well. After all, it's hard to credibly deliver one sweeping statement after another with little in between to connect those statements or build relationships to the point where they make sense.  I think the writers (perhaps properly) assumed viewers were familiar with the basic characters so they just skipped character development and went straight to having the characters speak in a macro fashion. This was a mistake and the entire miniseries suffers for it.  Timothy Dalton seems to give it his all despite poor material and Billy Zane either by virtue of his character or adequate acting chops does alright. Leonor Varela, unfortunately, is simply not up to the task of playing Cleopatra as she deserves to be portrayed. While waiting for Caesar, she seems to be waiting anxiously for her prom date to show up. In her scenes with Dalton, she seems to be acting in love rather than coming across as actually in love with him. She does look great though and can wear the revealing costumes well.  I wouldn't have bought this DVD on its own and I'm uncertain if I'll watch it again. I like mini-series in general and many of the Hallmark productions specifically but I'm afraid I can't recommend this one 
 Video quality could be better and the appearances of featured 'star'were fewer than expected 
 I've had the AT-PL120 turntable for about a month. It worked relatively well with the included cartrdge. There was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver's volume up very loud with no record playing. I tried installing a Sure M78S cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started. There was noticable hum even when playing records. I also installed an Audio-Technica AT440MLa Cartridge. This cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies. The hum was outrageous from the second I turned the thing on. The cartridge works fine in my brother's old Kenwood direct-drive unit. I tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my Mac for CD burning. The problem persists. The unit will be going back tomorrow. Very Disappointing 
 There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.   Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.  The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.  Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from "God's plan" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of "passive Christian guy thing", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.  And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan "The Gift of Singleness" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!  What's more, there are "unintended consequences" that can go along with Harris' model for "courtship" that he doesn't really address:  1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences:  (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your "potential marriage proposal" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is "the one", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their "wife prototype" might be. Guys who date and don't make a big deal of "a date" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In "How to Get a Date Worth Keeping", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really "their type" when they first met).  2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a "short-list") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your "ladder of options" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!  3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles.  4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.  5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, "he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?"...not always so.   If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about "the gift of singleness" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy. 
 While a previous reviewer calls this work "irrefutable", those with logical minds know better.  Obviously, this book is based upon the false premise that homosexuals are denied the right to marry.  All homosexuals have the right to marry, so long as their object of matrimony is of the opposite sex.  This begs the question...do any of us have the freedom to marry who and/or what we want?  Of course not.  I can't marry my computer, sister, brother, car, etc.  There are restrictions in marriage for everyone.  It doesn't take too much work to see through the author's flawed thinking in this excercise in futility.  Hopefully there are enough people who will realize this and send this book to the trash heap of irrelevancy. 
 There is no doubt that the author's veneration of the old time Plains Indians borders on hero-worship; and if enthusiasm alone could guarantee accuracy, this would be a great book. Unfortunately, that is not the case  here. I have studied Plains Indian culture for more than 30 years, and must  agree with the previous reviewer from Montana that this book is riddled  with errors from beginning to end. For example, Mails tells us that the  Indians made bow cases from the tails of mountain lions. I am currently  making a mountain lion quiver and bowcase myself, and I can tell you flatly  that the mountain lion never lived whose tail was big enough for this  purpose. Instead, the tail was always left as a pendant hanging from the  mouth of the quiver. Since Mails' book includes a full page color painting,  done by him, of a quiver with the tail hanging down in just that fashion,  you wonder how he could make this error - but he did, and many others like  it. Most of them could have been avoided if Mails had carefully read the  primary sources listed in his own bibliography.  This is a big, impressive  looking coffee-table type book, and so our natural inclination is to  believe whatever it says - an inclination strengthened by the fact that  Mails makes every statement with an air of absolute authority. The reviewer  from Pipestone, MN says that this book has all the answers, and it does.  The problem is that those answers are so often completely wrong 
 This book began to contradict on matter of King of kings Ismail. In one Chapter author wrote that King Ismail was a great King and was the best thing happened to Iran, the following chapter the author illustarted King Ismail as a burtail King of Iran 
 In writing her book, "Thinking," Arendt claims that it was Eichmann's absence of thought that underlay his evil deeds; and that her conclusion drew her to write the book ("Thinking").    Her conclusion was wrong.  It was the absence of feeling: the lack of feeling experience; the lack of awareness of feeling; and the lack of expression of it -- in all combinations.        Despite Arendt's courageous reporting in "Eichmann in Jerusalem," she demonstrates her own absence of thought - in drawing faulty conclusions, a sin of which we are all guilty from time to time, and one that is far less grievous than Eichmann's and those like him 
 This is the worst Seal Book ever written 
 This was awful. I'm sorry I spent a penny on this. 
 My problem is, is that I didn't read any of the books. But just ordered one & waiting on it. I do feel that the people who think Michael Schiavo was thinking of the best interest of his wife, was only for his own personal needs. He wanted to move on with his life, he should have done it in a different way. He should of turned everything over to "Terry Schindler's" family. I am a CNA, and I have taken care of people who have had feeding tubes & did not feel they were in a vegetative state. When rolling them over in bed, from side to side as you are suppose to do every 2 hours, they look at you in different ways, they make noises if you ACCIDENTLY hurt them when turning them. They are people just like us. Just because Terry was supposevly running out Michaels money, that did not belong to him in the first place, was no reason for that Son of B*^ch to make her suffer the way she did. If Terry was going to die, she would have died a long time ago.....ON HER OWN!!! She was just to strong of a woman to NOT GIVE UP!! And as far as I see it, there is no reason to rate any of the books if you had followed the NEWS. That's what I did. It didn't take Michael to long to find another woman and move on with his life, no matter if he was there with Terry everyday. Michael was just lucky enough to find another woman to put up with that, or she was just looking for the same thing Michael was looking for. And I feel that was the rest of Terrys money, so they could enjoy there life with Terrys money. I think i've said enough......everyone needs to remember, "What Goes Around, Comes Around!" Michaels day is coming & when it does......Terry will be waiting! 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 My mother got me this book as a gift...and it is a truly interesting idea for a book. This book lacks the charm of the "soup" books...most  of the stories are drawn out from the one sentence in which they could be  summarized. It seems as though Ford, in trying to solicit stories, accepted  the first 101 and did not edit or improve any submissions at all. Some of  the stories, granted, are interesting, engaging, and even a bit spooky.  Unfortunately, the majority seem contrived and more the fare of late-night  campfire chats or urban legends than genuinely inspiring stories of the  "other side". In future editions of this book (which I am sure  there will be), Ford could, should, and for her own integrity as a writer,  must be more selective in choosing her stories. And.. just *perhaps* she  could make the parody title a tiny, tiny bit less obvious 
 The book focuses on the use of electronic implants to control one's  thoughts and reactions. Some of the information is useful. Things like  trying to help those who have epileptic fits control what causes an attack  by sending an electrical message to the brain to stop the occurence.  Unfortunately, Mr Delgado has very menacing intentions in other areas. He  is one who believes in the administration of implants to individuals for  behaviour modification. The intention to psychologically abuse anyone who  deviates from societies norm. An interesting great question, who decides  who is wierd and how do you define normal? These implants allow the  monitoring of every thought and action whereby the tresspasser can see  through your own eyes. Further information can be found on the mind control  forum 
 Well, after reading her acknowledgements in the front, I was thrilled to see author Diana Gibaldon listed.  I was really expecting a book that would catch me at the first page, even second or third.  I thought that her time  travel aspect was vague along with the actual discription of graphics.  I  never really understood most of her discriptive writting regarding  surroundings and action. The idea behind the story was good.  I just wish  it was more intriguingly developed.  Maybe next time 
 Sorry, but this is ok I guess if you want to do a lot of reading and listening to repititive talking.  This guy obviously has recorded (at low audio quality) a class he has taught  many times before, and it is quite tedious. The jokes are not very funny, he has a nasal voice, and you can hear the students in  his class on the cd (laughing at this not so funny comments).  There's no music and then chimes some bell or something, which is very distracting.  The book is very pretty if you want it to be a piece of coffee table dust, but I would reccommend a very calm audio-musical CD versus this CD (try Stephen Halpern or a number of other good yoga/ meditationg music and /or nature cds).  A much better, simpler, to the point book is Meditation for Busy People Barnes and Noble 
 I must say I was dissapointed with those 2 stories. First story is so far from reality (I know, I know, sometimes we want to get away-but not That Far!!!) I couldn't read even half of the 2nd story...It was written very poorly. Sometimes I felt like something just wasn't enough, at times opposite - like it was way too much! Anyway, I wouldn't recomend bying this book..

 Losing Iraq illustrates what went wrong with planning for post-liberation Iraq although not for the reasons its author, a Council on Foreign Relations staffer, intends. In the run-up to the Iraq war, the State Department hired Phillips to moderate seminar discussions among Iraqis. He uses this limited experience to conclude that the cause for difficulty in post-liberation Iraq was not lack of planning but rather a failure to listen. "How could such noble intentions [Iraq's freedom] go so wrong?" he asks. "The White House and Pentagon political appointees thought they could liberate a county without talking to those they were liberating," he replies.  Phillips appears unaware that every Iraqi who met with him also visited the Pentagon, National Security Council, and Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. officials would meet almost daily at the National Security Council, chaired by officials such as Zalmay Khalilzad, then the president's special assistant for Iraq, and Stephen Hadley, then-deputy national security advisor.  Rather than researching and analyzing prewar planning, Losing Iraq becomes a testament to the author's ego and pettiness, features that caused Iraqis and U.S. officials alike to push Phillips aside. He describes Kanan Makiya, with whom he clashed on issues including de-Baathification, as poisoned by neoconservatives who transformed him from an academic to a polemicist. Most Iraqis and Americans differed and questioned whether Phillips's hostility was due to jealousy of Makiya's prominence in fields in which Phillips sought to compete. Phillips also writes that he initiated ideas like a Kirkuk commission to adjudicate competing property claims but was ignored. Actually, such a commission was up and running weeks before his epiphany.  Phillips revises events liberally, saying, for example, that he and Ryan Crocker, deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, opposed the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority because it did not empower Iraqis. Actually, Crocker opposed the transfer of sovereignty.  The irony of Phillips's argument is hubris. He chides Bush administration officials for not listening to Iraqis, but he himself did not bother to travel to Baghdad in the wake of Iraq's liberation. Rather, as revealed in a Wall Street Journal review by Rob Pollock, he lifted descriptions from newspapers. His experience in Iraq was limited to a few brief trips to Iraqi Kurdistan before the war, the sheltered guest of a Kurdish politician.  Losing Iraq may try to castigate the White House but instead becomes an example of the arrogance about which so many Iraqis complain. Phillips treats Iraq as a template upon which to lay down his theories. The Iraqi voice is subsumed to his own. If the White House really lost Iraq-the success of the Iraqi elections suggests otherwise-it was because it subordinated the voice of Iraqis to outside advisors like Phillips, more interested in pumping up their own importance than in the welfare of Iraq.

 Would not recommend it......did not like it at all 
 It's not Spiral, Albedo 0.39, or China. It's okay but nothing exciting. If you like his mushy bland stuff, buy it, but if you like Dervish D, Pulstar, and the sound of keyboards being pushed to their limit of expression, don't bother 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 Behar's book addresses borders as both metaphors and reality in a facinating way, yet other than that, this book fails miserably due to her experiments with the construction of her text. Overall, the historical development of ethnographic representation would have been better served if Behar had decided to write her book in a different style that better represents the ethnographic aspect of her text 
 I read this book because I liked The Ice Storm. I read this book because of the descriptions of what the book was about and the 5 star remarks of various reviewers. I thought, wow... another "Rules of Attraction" something funny, cynical, and stories of passive, troubled youth growing up in the 80's. I thought it was going to be a good read. I was wrong. Wrong. I judged a book because of its descriptions but I should be weary next time. I've never read a book about slackers and 20 somethings so boring in my entire life. Drugs, sex, music, parties, psycho hospitals... those topics should be interesting, fun, sentimental, or whatever to read about. But Moody just bored me and in the end this book should be forgotten. It was highly disappointing and the characters are not worthy. Bret Easton Ellis can at least pull off dispicable and hateful characters that are fun to read about but the dispicable characters in this book I didn't even care for. I just wanted to finish it and get done with it. Just like the characters in this book too stupid to be named, this book is too stupid to be remembered.   
 	In Heresy, Magic, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Gary K. Waite attempts to tie together the various persecutions that took place in Early Modern Europe.  Whether persecution was aimed against Christian heretics, witches, or Jews, its purpose was always the same: reinforcing current orthodoxy against growing doubt.  Thus, Waite claims that the more pluralistic the society, the less fringe groups were persecuted. 	This book is flawed.  Waite argues his thesis tendentiously, citing portions of scholarship on Early Modern Europe that support his claims and ignoring scholarship that would question them.  The book is a brief synthesis of other scholars' works, and Waite's contribution consists of mere assertions that lack supporting evidence.  Waite does not engage the sources of Early Modern Europe; instead he trusts others to do the work of research for him.  When he quotes a primary source, his citation is always from some secondary literature.  This form of "researching" may be fine for a survey of the historiography, but Waite is attempting to argue a thesis. 	Not only is his methodology wanting, but also his thesis is much too simplistic.  Waite argues as societies become more pluralistic, persecution of the "Other" lessens.  He cites example after example of how the reigning orthodoxy persecuted the "Other" in order to strengthen its position in society.  Places like the Netherlands and Maria Theresa's Austria, however, did not persecute irrationally because of tolerance for a multiplicity of ideas.  This formulation is inadequate.  Waite fails to grapple with the religious situation in Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Spain was the most ethnically and religiously diverse region in Europe, and its variegated population managed a high level of cooperation for centuries.  Instead of peaceful toleration, however, this region led to some of the most intense persecution of the "Other." 	Waite's explanation of the Jewish situation in Early Modern Europe also has many problems.  He asserts, "Jews ... were officially tolerated in the Christian west because they proved an extremely useful, if unwitting, ally in the campaign to expel religious doubt from the hearts of Christian believers" (19).  As a causal claim, this statement is ludicrous.  Waite implies a conspiracy by the Church to use Jews to quench Christian doubt.  The evidence does not support this assertion.  (His reasons for the persecution of women during the witch-hunts similarly lack evidentiary substantiation.) 	Not only are Waite's methods and assertions suspect, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the subject that he is trying to address.  In the book's introduction, Waite writes, "Religion is always nonrational, for its tenets cannot be proven by empirical testing" (3).  This statement belies a misunderstanding of rationalism, religion, or both.  As a system of knowledge, rationalism is not dependent on evidence or empirical testing.  Rationalism relies on human reason.  Just as religion cannot be empirically tested, neither can mathematics.  Rationalism and empiricism are competing systems of knowledge.  Waite's conflation of the two demonstrates a positivist bent, and positivism is self-referentially absurd.  Thus, Waite founds his philosophical approach to this subject upon a defective meta-narrative, and readers should be skeptical of his claims 
 I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it.  There were several things that did trouble me however: 1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person.  I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her.  Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.  2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived.  Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements. 3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.  For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.   4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian. 5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy. 
 I did not find this book to have any "solutions." It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem 
 I need not say more than those two words, but I will -- this book is just awful.  I was expecting a real memoir & this is just a collection of boring anecdotes and pats on the back, combined with crabbiness about modern life 
 More than I can count.  But since this is a short review of the book, lets stick to the one reason to toss this book into the recycle bin.  Clinton created a lean and mean military, not Bush.  Any success Bush and Rumsfeld have ever done is because of Clinton and his advisors.  Bush and Rumsfeld have never served in a war, nor have they seen combat.  Does anyone really think they could battle terrorism ? Not on their life and not on any of their rich relatives lives either. (Except for Bush Sr, who was a great president because he had actually seen war and combat.) Leave the wars to people who know about war and leave this author, who hasn't served either, to gather dust 
 I've been looking for this style of phone for a while, looks great, works great but it's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use.  It's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my Samsung SPH-A900. When the Samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone. I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home.  If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women. Also it does not have any plugs for headsets.  I am returning mine to Amazon 
 Actually, I am very disappointed that I did not have an opportunity to even watch this movie because I was sent a DVD for the US regional code instead of the Australian regional code and I could not watch it. I am, hopefully, getting a replacement from yourselves and then return the wrong one. This means extra international postage costs to me, which I am not hapy with either 
 Banks can be forgiven for making his heroine unbelievable.  Unfortunately, she is also unsympathetic and uninteresting.  That's quite an achievement; after all, Hannah Musgrave is a terrorist, lesbian chimp-keeper who runs a farm, helps spring a Liberian dictator from prison, and raises three guerilla rebels.  Banks does a much better job with the real-life terrorist John Brown.  Skip 'The Darling' and read 'Cloudsplitter' instead 
 This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters.  Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span).   If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters 
 COME was released during a rough time in Prince's career, possibly the height of his quarrels with Warner Bros. (his long-time label). Listening to this, you get the feeling that Prince may have released it as a 'f*** you' to the WB. He really was writing and recording great material at the time, and performing great concerts, but you wouldn't know it from listening to COME.  Regardless, there's one epochal cut here, "Loose!" A thunderous stomp that's one part hard-funk, one part industrial, I've heard some compare it to a Nine Inch Nails production, but it's totally Prince. As much as I hate this album, I always come back to "Loose!" You can probably purchase it through online vendors like iTunes for roughly a dollar, otherwise, get one of the cheap, used copies here (as of this writing there are a few well under $2 before shipping).  Hopefully WB or Prince will make "Loose!" available on a compilation, rendering COME obsolete, but until that happens, the disc is worth listening for that one track alone 
 Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!  
 Dangerous Skies is a story that is mainly about two boys that live in the middle of the 1700s.  One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out.  One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it.  The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that.  I do not really like this book because it was really boring and it had no point.  If you want to fine out what happens in the end you should read the book 
 During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done 
 This story is written in sort of a fanciful prose fairy tale like style, but that's where the niceness ends.  I would say that Mona Gray suffers from extreme Obsessive-Comulsive Disorder.  She has this completely bizarre habbit of knocking on wood when events become too much for her to handle, she eats strange things when she can't handle her real life, she buys herself an axe, yes an axe, as a birthday present and what happens with that axe is almost too much to take in.    It seems though thst poor Mona is doomed from the start.  Her favorite Math teacher/hardware store owner makes wax number necklaces and wears a different number depending on his mood.  Mona's father has all but given up on life and has started dying from the outside in. Every character in this book it seems is suffering from some sort of mental illness and it forces me to think: What is wrong with the author?  It turns out that the reviews I have read of this book make it seem much more mainstream than it really is.  The fact that Mona and her family have quit nearly everything that they've tried and it seems like they live in another universe come in a distant second to the warped reality of this book. 
 I was looking forward to another Oprah magazine with great joy.  Unfortunately, the pomp and circumstance within "O at Home"'s pages is a real turnoff for me, an average, middle-class American living, as they say in "middle America".  Although I hesitate to say this in print, it's been in my head for ahile now.  I am a faithful 20-year Oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine.    Is it possible that Oprah has not only forgotten her roots, but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in Malibu?  Is it possible that she has forgotten the 90% of us who live somewhere in between?  If this magazine is an indication, then sadly, she has 
 If you check out the page you find this "womens" watch for $133.99 you will also find the "mens" version for just $98.00. Why would this be? If anthing because of the gold plating and the mens watch being much larger, it would cost more to make the mens watch. More size, more gold, more gold, higher price to make. Another little thing that bothers me is both watches are shown together with a little "better together" hook. Better for who? There is not once cent in discount for buying together.  I own an Invicta and have had no trouble with it. I would buy the pair for my wife and I. But, I am not going to toss out an extra $35.99 for the womens watch just because Invicta and/or amazon feel they can charge more for if anything a product that would not cost as much to make.  Man, it seems that the women would really get hot over this 
 The archaeologists say that there is no record for invasion/immigration  then why should Flood use that as the centre piece of his analytical  framework for the development of Hinduism 
 Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film.  It has the feel and tone of  the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.  The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film (when most of the musical scenes occur) are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.  Worse yet, the sets do not look like 1963.  This is very clearly a cheap production, doomed from the start by an awful script, terrible acting, and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era.  Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the Cruisers, has disappeared (he died in a car accident, but his body was never recovered), a reporter decides to write a story about the band.  She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.  She forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members, who are, by the way, dull as dirt, to piece together the band's history.  The reporter is so creepy and annoying that she'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her, nowadays.  Ironically enough, A Season in Hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 1. Cannot do live video capture of streaming from a tripod, since the firewire and USB interfaces both require the HandyCam Station to be in place (which covers up the tripod mounts). 2. Transferring video from this to a Windows machine is terrible. Works fine with a Mac, but iMovie on the Mac is inadequate for capturing video for use on web. Capturing video on Windows is a nightmare to setup...especially if you use a variety of computers. 
 This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say "when is this gonna get going?" and none of them ever do.  It's like slow-motion bland-pop 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 Not only should you not buy this book you shouldnt even open it.Karim Rashid deserves great credit for his ability to fool corporations and college freshmen into buying into his vision of a hot pink world but as far as design goes, he is a joke, his "look" was over in 1995 six months after it started. Anyone with a 3d modeling program on there home computer could produce this work. Take a shape, close your eyes, punch some keys on your computer, color it purple, call it a vase,lamp,chair,whatever and voila the Karim Rashid formula. The entire book almost is made not of photos but of computer generated images, this stuff doesnt even exist(thank God). He needs to go back to Canada or Egypt, repurchase the 40,000 records he supposidly "threw in the trash" and pick up his gig as the DJ he really is and leave the designing to the designers. Shame on the ignorant people out there who cant see the Emperor is naked 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 Somebody gave me this book, since I'm an amateur tracker; I doubt I'd have bought it if I read the reviews.  Parts of it were truly delightful, I admit, but I got a stomach-ache everytime I read some sort of pseudo-science or bastardization of actual science.  When factual claims are made that contradict what we know is true (I won't repeat the other reviewers' comments), or are made without evidence or reliable references, I can't trust anything else the author says.  It's a shame, because, for example I suspect the relation between foot shape and being "down to earth" is bunk (in lieu of carefully controlled studies to verify this), there *has* been a recent study showing a correlation between index/ring finger length ratio and the subject's sexual orientation or athletic ability. But, as with most pseudo-science, such actual science is disregarded in favor of wishful thinking 
 The Initiation is very slow and dreadful movie. The first 40 minutes are wasted with flashbacks and talking but the end in the shopping mall is decently done. The ending plot twist was a nice surpise but other than that this movie is strictly rental material 
 I, too, have read The Artist's Way and found much that was valuable in it. It's a beautiful book, inspiring and helpful on many levels. So I was interested to read Julia Cameron's memoir. What struck me immediately was her writing style, which I don't particularly like. Her dialogue, especially, is stilted and awkward. Do none of the people in her world use contractions? Anyway, as the book got deeper into her life and she began to describe her breakdowns or "breakthroughs", as her Taos friends insisted on seeing these obvious psychotic episodes, I at first arm-chair diagnosed her as being bi-polar. One of her doctors, did too. But then he changed his mind and told her that she never had been and to wipe that from her consciousness. It came to me though, that this woman may well be the world's highest functioning schitzophrenic! She hears voices and she takes instructions from them. They "dictate" books, essays, plays, and even music to her. And then I realized that the entire concept of The Artist's Way is for each of us to hear our own voices which will then dictate great works of art to us. Of course, there's more to it than that, but this realization made me more than a little uneasy. There are so many contradictions in this book. At an early age she became completely disenchanted with the Catholic Church and abandoned it, but later on in life, she entrusted her health and her sanity to new-age healers who gave her readings (sometimes across great distances) and prescribed strange remedies. Although these remedies never seemed to work, she continued to consult with them and follow their advice. Unless, of course, their advice clashed with what she really wanted to do, which generally was to move from one coast to another, seeking some sort of peace and contentment, which I fear she will never find. I did not find this book helpful in any sort of artistic sense. I don't think any truly sane person would want to persue art in such an obsessive and unhealthful manner. I, for one, wouldn't have the energy. I will say that it was a book that I found hard to put down, but attribute that to it being sort of a car-crash type of book, more than to its literary style. 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 A redundant and poorly written tome that does not answer the important questions 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 It's always difficult for a beginner to review a textbook, because there's always the chance that your reactions are entirely offbase. It is possible that some people, trying to learn to hold their breath longer while underwater will value 360 pages of advice as "Getting Dressed. Start by putting on the trousers: insert the legs, first one then the other," and "We complete the scaling of the existential levels by passing to the colour violet, where we stabilise a contact with our most intimate reality, that which we call the spiritual dimension," while foregoing any significant discussion of strategies for dealing with the sensations of holding your breath.   To me, this book is infuriatingly short of relevant information. Not only do you get advice on how to put on pants, there are sections that seem relevant (the 2.5 pages on the circulatory system, say), that jump between streams of grade-school exposition ("The heart is a hollow muscle that has the capacity to function like a pump; expanding and contracting, it sucks blood that is delivered continuously by the veins and pushes it to the peripheries of the body through the arteries....") and trivia ("...[blood] is propagated by their elastic walls at a velocity of 9 meters per second. However in the arterioles of the periphery the velocity drops to one millimetre per second....") without actually introducing any relevant facts (does blood velocity have something to do with freediving? Maybe. I wouldn't know it after reading this book. And the book is packed with clearly irrelevant information, such as 2 pages on the Beaufort wind scale).  To reconcile my reaction with the 5 star reviews from those who can do statics of 5+ minutes and so forth, I can only say that perhaps they skipped the trivia, don't need practical advice on breath holding, and valued specific advice on, say, finning technique.   The 30 pages of chapter 11 "Training for Apnea" will _possibly_ take less time to read than finding equivalent advice on the Web, but are hardly worth $40. For me, this book was an utter waste of money. 
 Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting.  I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected.  It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children.  Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending.  My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money 
 I would not recommend reading this book as the information is often technically inaccurate and misleading. There are many other books that provide much better and more accurate information 
 This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story.  There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell:  First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring 
 Mike Patton made Faith no More (even if he wasn't in the abdn originally).  his unique vocals made the band good, this Disc on the other hand is just horrible.  For Days I tried to pull myself up to listen to it, but I couldn't get past a minute of each song.  I'm so glad Patton came in and turned this band around.  Only get this if you want to complete your Faith no More collection, other wise, stay FAR FAR away from this album 
 One thing I enjoyed about Bear's books such as Anvil of Stars and Eon is his ability to keep the action going. This book, sadly, just drags along, and the action is mostly mundane adventure, unrelated to science fiction. This book really has nothing to do with Eon, except for a few short chapters at the beginning and the end. Ser Olmy enters a weird planet through a gate and the book takes place there. The science fiction angle is uninspired. If you were intrigued by the physics and mystery of the Way, don't follow Olmy through this gate. Surely, Bear has much more to offer than this 
 I have read many reviews on the Internet in response to Lynn's book Planet Two.  Some have asked,  Why didn't Lynn reveal where the original teachings came from?  I know where these teachings came from....I have all the original teachings in written form, 8 books unpublished and over 1500 tapes of recorded classes held by the entity Rajni.  I have the tape that the Rajni spoke to her about plagiarising....that it is not servicing to your godhood to copy someone else's work. Lynn plagiarized the first few books and ran out of material when she got to the last books.  I witnessed all the original channelled information, my mother was the channel and she died in 1995.  I believe Lynn's interpretation was distorted and offered a disservice to her readers.  The teachings deserve to be offered to the world in their original form.  [... 
 I bought this book since it was the most up-to-date book discussing financial careers.  I have found it to be too simplistic to be useful in my search for a banking job.  Odds are that you too are looking for a book that gives helpful info on job hunting - so if this is your purpose I advise against the purchase of this book.   Spend the extra few bucks and get the HBS Careers in Finance book instead 
 I have never purchased a product of any kind in my life with a quality control as low as this textbook demonstrated. I believe the publishers owe ever student who has ever purchased this book a full return.  Unfortunately there is a limited way for students to avoid purchasing this text if your proffesor intends to use it.  I strongly recommend lecturers do not choose this text as it will force your students to throw more than a hundred dollars down the drain, and to add further insult to injury, your students performance will decrease.  I know persons who are now less conversent in the subject of fluids for having read and used this text.  If the publishers had even had their children check the text for mistakes they would have ended up with a better product.  If publishers are smart enought to read these reviews I suggest to you that you get a real editor to go through the entire text and solutions manual with a fine tooth comb and release a sixth edition afterwards.  I feel extremely sorry for any student who has to learn fluids for the first time from this text 
 Rather disappointed. Only a few real usefull hints, some obvious "secrets", very disorganized, no logic structure.  I will be more careful selecting my next purchase espacially as I had to pay 10 Euro on top for the customs.. 
 I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I agree that this product is too small to be the best home for a Betta, but I think the Betta would say, if it could, please put me in this instead of the tiny cup I am in now!!!! I have had Bettas in 10 gallon tanks and in small bowls and some do like the smaller bowls better.  
 What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.  When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.  This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."  Obviously not a person who knows me well.  Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.  I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless 
 Before I start on this idiot-magnet, let me get one thing straight - Jackass was a GOOD TV show. For all it's gross-out moments, there were moments of genuine class and originality.  And I guess I know where they came from. On the one hand, we have Johnny Knoxville, who has moved on from Jackass to become a genuine star in Hollywood, going from mainstream success (Dukes of Hazzard) to critical acclaim (Grand Theft Parsons) in just a couple of years. A genuine talent, and someone to watch in the future.  Then we have Bam Margera, who took his "is cruel to his parents" thing from Jackass and made an entire show out of it. And it quite simply the most crass, unfunny and utterly, utterly FAKE rubbish on television.  It's maybe a pity Bam didn't have parents who were, I dunno, better actors than they are, because their "outraged" responses to his ha-ha-larious stunts wouldn't seem out of place at a Sunday school play. The mother is the worst offender, and while Bam's stupid tagalong friends laugh in all the right places, there is a genuine cruel streak and nasty side to Bam that makes the whole program have a very bitter after-taste. I'd like to see what would happen if one of the yahoo's DIDN'T laugh or go along with everything.   Of course, this show isn't aimed at the likes of The Curmudgeon. It's aimed at the big-shorted dumbass kids who think Avril Lavigne RAWWWWKS and can't see another phony being stuffed down their easily pleased, "Hey Kids, This Is COOL" MTV propoganda-fed throats.  A loathsome, spoilt man child abusing his stupid mother and morbidly obese father? You wonder why it doesn't work. Then you remember it's one-trick pony Bam Margera, a guy pushing 30 who still tries to act like he's 14. And that his mother and father are in on every single second of it. Another pitiful MTV product that you should steer well clear of.  [... 
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 No band outside of the blues rock genre has ever gotten the formula right for cover albums.  Guns n Roses "The Spaghetti Incident" was laughable, and now this piece of garbage comes out.  My older brother had this album for a while, but after listening to the cover of Imagine, I had no interest in it anymore.  Than, a little while later, I saw the track listing again, had heard a few more of the originals, and decided to give it a try.  I only got through a few songs.  Here they are.  First, the Lennon track is terrible.  I might not be so harsh to this particular track, except John Lennon mastered the song on his own so that anybody short of God couldn't do this track over again.  Next, "Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie."  Now, I didn't think this was possible.  Black Flag is one of the best bands of all time, and Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie was one of their best songs.  Hell, I'm listening to it as I type this.  Now, I don't know how, but they managed to make this song so horrendous I only got halfway through before taking the CD out, and throwing out a window, much to my brother's dismay and anger.  This same thing applies to Fear's "Let's Have a War," except I didn't throw the CD out on this one.  Wanted to, but tried to restrain myself.  My only truly specific beef with "Let's Have a War" is that they took an ironic, humorous song seriously, and completely twisted the message, while butchering the song.     One of the worst albums I've ever heard (and I own "Willenium!" 
 China cannot be trusted and Robert Sutter tells us why. In pages after pages, the author gives ample reasons that, as a rising power, China has to be watched carefully.   According to Sutter's theory, historically, China has had hegemonic ambitions. Not only she portrays her own struggles as of universal significance, she also keeps a close watch of countries around her periphery as if they are naturally within her sphere of influence. Her political leaders are hypersensitive to criticisms and tend to behave defensively. The Chinese plot their policies and strategies, not much guided by principles but mainly on a case-by-case bases. They are more likely to go after short-term gains than for long-term benefits. As a result, Chinese foreign policy tends to be capricious and disruptive. In Sino-US relations in particular, China has been long suspicious of U.S. ulterior motives and is actively hedging against U.S. policies through bilateral and regional actions.  In the same vein, Sutter views China's recently totted "peaceful rising" with suspicion. Whether China has truly renounced aggressive posture in her international dealings, or she just says so to "bid time" in order to secure economic growth, remains to be seen. As how to engage a rising China, Sutter sees Bush administration's approach as a potential model:  keep her at arms length, do not give any unwarranted expectations (as Clinton administration has purportedly done), and stand firm.  My personal observation is, although there is some truth to many of his assertion, Sutter's ultimate fallacy is that he uses a liberalist standard to criticize China in order to justify U.S. own realist strategy.   For example, Sutter interprets China's proposal of opening its agricultural market to ASEAN countries as a way to undercut Japanese or Korean positions (p82). This is so anti-liberal for its Machiavellian motive, he seems to argue, it is yet another example of why China cannot be trusted. But even if we put aside the merit of such a decision in itself, and to look at parallels in U.S. policies, such a criticism is as unjustified as it is hypocritical. Since the WTO meeting in Cancun, U.S. Trade Representative has repeatedly offered to cut U.S. domestic agriculture subsides, not only to advance American agenda, but also to put pressure on the Europeans. The consensus in this case, however, is that America is exerting her leadership role in promoting Free Trade.  In his "China's International Relations" essay in Samuel Kim's book, Alastair Iain Johnston observed that some of the "China Threat" talks are self-fulfilling prophesies (has anyone mentioned Cuba being a victim of such prophesy?) I'd argue China Skeptics such as Sutter are no different. China's in U.S. crosshair today is not entirely her own fault, it is more or less because what she is or what she can be, especially in a world according to the U.S. For example, other world powers-that-be, like the European Union, is never that concerned about China's potential as another USSR. Other than some spousal disputes like economic matters, E.U. and China are getting along just fine---if not too close to U.S.'s liking, as in the recent case of proposed lifting of arms sales ban by the E.U.  Even the herbivore countries living along the fringe of the dragon's cave are not so concerned with impending subjugation as a result of China's rise---as Sutter implies what could happen. On the contrary, some of them are acting as brakes to U.S. check on China. Even Australia told U.S. not to automatically count on her support had a conflict in Taiwan Strait broke out.  If Sutter does not consider himself as part of the China bashing gang, he must hold a very high standard of who is--- maybe the likes of University of Chicago's John Mearsheimer? Around the same time I read this book, I heard a media interview with James McGregor, a businessman/author. Although his criticism of China is no less harsh at times, he is at least coherent---China is just another business opportunity. If your objective is to make profit, you will have to learn to live with reality. Unfortunately, for analysts like Mr. Sutter, their job is to constantly look out for the surreal 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 To anyone who has or is planning on reading this book, consider this. This book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone's guilty conscience ease in thinking that "your own will is god's own will." (quoted from Walsh's books) If you will it, then God wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom, right? Will is a precursor to action. If there is no such this an a 'right' or 'wrong' will, then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right' or 'wrong' action. If someone else's actions hurt you, you feel that action is wrong. But the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way, right? It was his will, therefore he was justified and right and god's right there to back him up. The victim is suffering. Where is his god when he needs him? Was the victim correct in believing the action wrong? Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right? In this book, god says that WE have the authority to decide what is right or wrong. The action is both right and wrong, right? Wrong.  This is when you may want to take a look at the Bible. The Bible portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God. Holy is defined as exalted or worthy of complete devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness. He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and wrong as clear as day where sometimes it appears to be a tangled mass to our limited senses. He created us and gave us a conscience which can in most cases discern a right and wrong in a situation. He gave us a free will which allows us to then choose that right or wrong. Are we always going to do the right thing? No, and He knows that. When we do wrong thing, it is unhealthy at best to believe that doing wrong is the right thing to do because we desire it. We're NOT God. We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this. He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what's told in His book. But he knows that even still we will do wrong when attempting in good faith to do right. And that is why in a generous act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way, sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs, and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly amazing thing He did for us. It's a beautiful thing!  I urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be. 11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after much persecution. Wow!  I've been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He's continued to worked wonders in my life. I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path.  In case you're wondering, I gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in Christ by giving a glaring example of what God is not.  If you've read through all of this, thank you. I encourage you to write me. God bless!  
 Whether the book tells you exactly how to do a mission or not you'll still end up failing it a few times before you actually complete it. Most of what is written in this book is a no brainer and easy to figure out. The only good I see from the book are possibly different routes or secrets here and there but even those you can get online for free so there is no point wasting the money 
 What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?  To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.  But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.  But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.   After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.  To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel 
 Got frustrated reading this book. No pace. Not for Alistair McLean kind of readers. You can easily quit reading this book even if you are in the middle. I only completed it for the heck of it.. wonder why I started reading it at all. I should have read Detective(Arthur Hailey) instead. Would have insured I finish it in the same night, rather than spread it out over almost 2 weeks, as Trevayne did.  However, Trevayne and Bonner did make a good combo. Both had a great character. The only interesting points in the novel are when these two are in conversation or Trevayne is with Sam. Nothing else 
 Cleopatra Records produces a wide variety of compilations. Some quite good (tribute to pink floyd and gong's YOU remixed) and others awful. This package falls into the awful category. A nicely done package with little inside. Over 50 bands contribute to this. Biggest names are Bauhaus (In the Flat Field), Leg. Pink Dots, Delerium, Fields of Nephilim, Boyd Rice, etc. If you are a true collector of these folks and expect to get something new or really rare, forget it. Most of it is available. The rest of the multitude of bands sound like 80 throwbacks. Nothing really innovative or original. Problem with gothic has always been it's pretentiousness. Cleopatra has already released a variety of dull gothic compilations, why do this again? I am sure there is something in here for everyone, but not everyone will love all of this material. Borrow it from a friend, not worth the price in my opinion.   
 The graphics handling presented in the book takes no account of multiple  color depths... only 256-color mode.  There is no code presented to handle  what we all face every day... a mixture of 256-color, 16-bit high color and  24-bit true color images.  Even if you run in the required 256-color mode,  many examples don't work properly.  This book is a disappointment 
 It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC.  I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it.   Very disappointing 
 Even though I have no issue with the seller (they shipeed really quickly) I'll tell you definitely don't waste your money on this garbage.  I bought a pair for a trip to Tahoe recently, and before I even made it to the FIRST RUN the zipper split.  Got it back together, and held for the rest of the day.  Second day, I hadn't even made it up the first ski lift and the zipper broke again, permanently this time.  Nothing like skiing with your bibs open all day.  Upon returning to the lodge, I found out one of the seams on the inside had split, too.  Promptly threw the pants out after that, no sense in re-packing them for another cross country flight!  Spend your money elsewhere instead of throwing it away on these pants 
 Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.   Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it.  
 Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.    A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended 
 I love Rosemary Clooney.  She was among the very best singers this country ever produced, and was "class" with a capital C.  Rosemary had a special way with a song:  perfect enunciation, an incredible sense of rhythm, and a style that showcased both simplicity and deep emotion--a rare combination.  It was so sad in the last years of her life that her voice let her down.  Rosemary's voice had been a little rough for years, but her sheer musicianship and emotional connection with lyrics enabled her to rise above this problem--especialy on up-tempo numbers--however "White Christmas" marked the beginning of her greatest decline.    Over the years I have tried repeatedly to like this album, but I cannot.  Poor Rosemary sounds so tired, maybe even sad.  I own practically every album she made for Concord Jazz up to this point and enjoyed them all, but after this point her voice only got worse and worse.  It was painful to listen to the decline of such a great singer, so I stopped buying her CDs.  I would like to give this album a better rating because it contains two of my favorite things--Rosemary Clooney and Christmas songs--but I can't.  If she had only recorded this album a few years earlier, we might have had a classic Christmas album for the ages. 
 I bought this for a trip to record my photo's from a Nikon D200.  I shoot RAW and JPEG format concurrently.  Upon returning from my trip I Disconvered that the MC1 only records JPEG files as a stand alone. It will record RAW files if processed through a PC.  I contacted Sony to see if there is a Firmware update that will allow me to record RAW files as a stand alone.  Sony responded that they are developing a follow-on unit that will have this capability and there will is no planned update for the MC1 to record RAW files as a stand alone 
 Let me start off, by saying that I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially of his work in the 80's and 90's when he really blew up. So, when you read this review, don't think that I'm an ignorant hater. Because I am not. I just give you my thoughts about this book. Here goes:  Y'all know what the book is about so I am not going to repeat it all over again. Jimmy Tock and the 5 horrible days that he will meet throughout his life.  I thought the book was awful and most of all- ridiculous. And I will tell you why. There was no credibility in the characters whatsoever. Usually DK does a great job in creating credible characters. Well, he totally blew it this time. Why? Because ALL of the characters are acting like idiot. There is NO WAY that Jimmy, his wife Lorrie, and his familly can act with so much humour in every single situation. Every single time Jimmy and his wife face a horrible situation, their worst enemies and when they are close to dying, it seems like they've got something funny and sophisticated to say. I mean, come on! That's just stupid! You're one step away from getting killed and all you can do is tell jokes and act like an idiot? That was totally annoying! All throughout the book, jokes and jokes in the worst situation. I know it's just a book of fiction, but the characters still need to be believable. Well, in this book, they ARE NOT.   The plot itself isn't so bad, but it's not good either. Especially the last few chapters, where everything is getting clearer - well the end doesn't make a lot of sense either, and it's like Koontz made an end for little kids or teenagers who haven't read a lot of books and don't know what a good book is. The end, when they meet their worst enemy is almost like the end of a soap opera - an ending that doesn't really make sense (and of course you get a lot of those stupid supposed-to-be-sophisticated jokes from the annoying Tock familly).  So, I am sorry for ripping this book appart, but to me it was a piece of trash. I just had to read it till the end, because I was on a vacation in Thailand and I couldn't find a good book at that time. Plus I wanted to see how low DK could go. It seemed (at least on that book) that he was tired of writing long books with a lot of developements and he just rushed this book with its ridiculous characters. 2 stars and that's generous of me. A waste of time. Get DK's books from the 80's and 90's instead 
 One of the fun aspects of reading serial mystery series is that there are actually two things that you follow as the reader. The first is the murder mystery that is the point of the story and that you try to match wits with the detective and try to identify the perpetrator - i.e. the "whodunit" aspect. The second is that you get involved with the repetitive characters and follow their lives and developments.  The Joe Grey mysteries are no different in this respect in that early on in the series we learned about Joe's and Dulcie's remarkable abilities and we see them exercise these in every volume as they solve the various crimes that are committed in and around Molena Point.  In Cat to the Dogs, we have essentially only half of a book. Oh, I do not mean that you only read 100 pages instead of 200! No, what I mean is that you only get to read the soap opera aspects and there is no mystery!  The book starts with the murder and the reader knows that Joe Grey knows within the first five pages that there was a murder and that it was committed by a man. By the end of the first chapter you already know who the murdere was although his full name is not revealed until later on in the book.   The author tries to compensate for this by throwing in one more murder and two attempted murders as well as several other crimes, but all the mystery of "whodunit" is completely and utterly missing.  So, if you want to know more about Clyde, Charlie, Wilma, Max Harper and the rest of the gang; if you want to read the volume that introduces Kit to the mix, then this is one you want to read. If, on the other hand, you do not have the background on the base characters and their locations, and do not care to read more about these remarkable critters, then you can safely leave this one behind. 
 I recieved these dead, they don't fit right in most devices and I haven't been able to get them to work since they've been recharged, it's not my charger..... waste of mone 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 This book is outdated, outmoded, and nearly useless.  It contains tons of information on how to manipulate fabrics that aren't even in use anymore. Hardly anything on dealing with knit fabrics, which look better and are easier to manipulate. Ask anyone under 50 if they have ever seen any darts in their clothes? And all this slashing and turning and manipulating??? not only is it sloppy, its useless, Useless, USELESS! Lots of money spent for vague instructions on basic blocks, and only clothes made in the 80's. Save eyour money, just because this book is expensive, doesn't make it useful 
 This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life. 
 Dozois prefers the long short story or what might be called the condensed novel, and most of these stories are in that vein. Very few stories here are short. Dozois also prefers stories that are more about millieu and atmosphere rather than stories filled with metaphor or operate on some kind of ironic level (as did the stories in the old Wollheim/Carr anthologies). Perhaps this is due to the kind of science fiction being written today: it's mostly about predictable futures or predictable alien cultures, long on atmosphere and short on story. Many stories, in fact, don't really get going (the McDonald, the Reed, the Gerrold, the Turtledove) for several pages. (I was halfway through the McDonald before I had any understanding what the story was about, let alone what its conflict was--the story had almost no dramatic tension).    And there are a lot of lost opportunities. Robert Reed's story involves a ship larger than several worlds, but ends up becoming a mere - and unexciting - detective story. The trope or conceit of living in a HUGE space ship is lost both on Reed and the protagonist. What would human life be like if one were traveling the rim of the galaxy in a giant spaceship? Wouldn't that DO something to you? Well, apparently not. The story becomes just another murder mystery that needs to be solved.  The same is true of the David Gerrold story. It's a time travel story involving "timequakes" in the L.A. region (brilliantly realized by a man who's lived there all his life) but becomes devolves into a rather sordid homoerotic detective story in the end (with an ending that's so cliched that I'm surprised Gerrold let himself get away with it). And some of the stories are plain unpleasant, such as the Vonda McIntyre story. How it ended up here I have no idea. Another odd choice is the Alastair Reynolds story, "Along the Aquila Rift". I'm surprised that ANY editor published it: imagine a story told in the first person where, in the end, the person forgets what he has just told you. As a creative writing teacher, I would NEVER have a student tell a story in the 1st person and have it end: "And then I died" or "And then I was given amnesia". One can justifiably wonder how the heck the story got written down in the first place. How did it appear on the printed page?  (Alan Brennert, an otherwise notable writer, won a Nebula years ago by writing a story told by a ghost. I guess fantasy and science fiction writers can do things that mainstream writers cannot. Or perhaps everyone's taking their cues from John Gardner's GRENDEL wherein the monster, telling his tale, is, as we all know, killed in the end. I would let Gardner get away with the conceit, not so Mr. Reynolds. I want my money back!)   This anthology really is a collection of stories that Dozois would have published had he seen them all for Asimov's Science Fiction. To his credit, he has culled many of these from internet and other non-traditional publishing sources. But mostly these stories weren't a lot of fun, and most took a lot of patience to wade through. I did like the Wolfe story; but, again, the conceit of the story gets lost in a twist ending that can only be appreciated if one has endured a bad marriage and suffered inklings of spousal revenge. I miss Donald Wollheim and Terry Carr and Judith Merrill and Frederick Pohl and Groff Conklin. What happened to stories that were fun? Where is the sense of wonder here? Yes, there are dazzling depictions of India in the future and the wonders of genetic engineering and nanotechnology, but, really, who cares? What is present in this volume are stories written by the very best we have. But they're like weightlifters with these enormous muscles lifting really tiny weights. Is it because they have to crank out two stories a month and three novels a year in order to make a living? Find an old anthology edited by Damon Knight called THE DARK SIDE. It's out there somewhere. It's far better than these anthologies--collections that suggest a paucity of imagination in our field that's been around now for about twenty years. These people, and this editor, can do MUCH better than this 
 This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up. 
 I bought this product thinking a Sony drive should be a good one, right?  Wrong.  The drive claims to be 18X, but even with high-quality expensive media, I couldn't get the drive to burn any faster than 8X.  To make things worse, I was looking forward to the fast CD read speed so I could copy music to my iPod.  It turns out iTunes will not play CD's from this drive.  I can use Winamp, MusicMatch, and Windows Media Player to play CD's from this drive, but not iTunes.  What a disappointing product 
 Rarely have I had the misfortune of coming across such an unmitagated biased piece of "scholarly" writing.  The book is no doubt scholarly in Traill's coverage of Schliemann's letters and diaries, unfortunately the author seeks only those passages which he can twist to suit his own often stupifying arguments.  My advice is to only read this book if you want the view of an anti-Schliemann extremist, but to instead read Heinrich Schliemann's own publications and an assessment of his contribution from a trained archaeologist instead of a historian who cannot suitably comprehend (or in this instance decides to ignore) his contribution to the development of excavation and post-excavation analysis such as the pathological study of skeletal remains.  Schliemann was far from perfect but neither were his contemporaries, nor did he ever claim to be a "scholar" although he aspired to reach scholarly status.  It appears that certain sections of the academic community continue to attack this upstart amateur in the same way as some historians of the time did.  But those in the archaeology community are aware of Schliemann's contribution and would rightfully produce a much more balanced assessment than given by Traill, which lets face it would not be difficult 
 Before you pick up this "novel", please read a biography of Jerzy Kosinski's life by author James Park Sloan --Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography. In 1982, Kosinski was completely discredited by the Village Voice for fabricating his auto-biographical, The Painted Bird, and for plagarism found in his most of his other books. He slandered an entire nation (Poland) in The Painted Bird even though he was actually saved by Polish Catholics and lived in safety during the duration of the war. Instead of writing what was a true war experience he decided that shock and brutality would give him more notariety. He became rich and won countless awards and accolades for his damaging lies.  Before he committed suicide in 1991 he tried to make amends for the damage he caused to the Poles but it was too late. The Painted Bird has been deemed a "truth" and has been included on the reading lists of many Holocaust Study Courses.  I feel sorry for the Poles -- that this work produced by a sick, deviant and demented pathalogical liar could be taken as a true experience --it's like spitting on the graves of all those, Jews and Poles alike,that died in the hands of the Nazis during WWII.  It is a terrible injustice 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 Rated low because this is not accurately described. Lots of new age philosophy and history, not enough tips and recipes. 
 I is for I love you 'cause I have to, America.  Give the kids real books, please. Leave the brainwashing for the older folks 
  In the bokk Space Station Seventh grade by Jerry Spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station.Ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present.I thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another.For example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween.The author focuses on other subjects and doesn't realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea  
 This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.   However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near 
 Is there a risk that following the events of September 11, 2001, the United States may be overreacting, or acting in an improper or counterproductive manner?  Of course.  We need some thoughtful, objective, and constructive criticism.  And some good advice.  But this book doesn't provide it.  I'll mention just a couple of areas where I think the book disqualifies itself from being helpful.  The first is in the discussion of a racist American backlash against innocent Arab Americans.  And a backlash against dissent from American policies.  That's something that I do not take lightly.  And what this book says will, in my opinion, make matters worse.  Mahajan says "the backlash against dissent got so bad that even one tenured professor lost his job because of it."  Um, who lost his job?  Sami al-Arian!  For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed "credit" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories.  He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.  If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian.  He's not the right person to try to defend by claiming anti-Arab racism!  He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that "in his youth" he made "an intemperate speech."    Well, let's see how this book deals with the Levant.  The author says that the Oslo process was about the Arabs "bargaining away part of their internationally recognized rights to the whole of the occupied territories."  Unfortunately for him, there is no such right to all of the disputed West Bank.  Nor is there even a right to ethnically cleanse all Jews (or Arabs) who might wind up on the "wrong" side of the Israeli border.    You can give constructive advice on how to deal with terrorism.  Or you can support terrorism and taunt its victims.  But you can't do both.  And this book is defending the bad guys. 
 Another great player selling out to sell more.  Seems like another outbreak of the Kenny bug.  I'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when I say that Gerald Albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets.   Check out the 'Live at Birdland West' album for a taste of what Mr. Albright is really about. 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better.  Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible.  In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs.  Fables like The Choice (or the "free-market economy" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple.  That's why the book is dangerous.  The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good.  The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable.  If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.  Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well.  Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 My 3 yr old son received this toy last year for Christmas and was so excited. In less than a week, one of the rear wheels cracked in half, rendering it a non-returnable piece of junk 
 This book is very detailed (though not endnoted very clearly). In fact, I suspect the author may have been paid by the word...Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive. He makes a good case that bad things happen in the world, and that Israel negotiates often with US involvement, but I do not think he ties the two together into any sort of causal relationship, which is what the book promises. Just because two phenomena occur does not mean they are related to each other. I was hoping it could clearly make such an argument, and wanted him to succeed, since I know people who recommended this book. But he failed for me 
 I bought this DVD based on the Customer Reviews in Amazon.com.  I guess I just don't have the same sense of humor these people have. In all fairness, it has it's moments...although very few and very far between. The price in dollars I can live with. But, this DVD is a total waste of time. By the time it was over, it felt as though it was 3-hours long. If you have nothing better to do, watch it. That's what I did. To me, it wasn't worth it 
 Let's face it; some of the jokes are funny. The one about Mike Tyson been like someone else's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny. I also found the bit about Bill Clinton and Osama Bin Laden also funny. However, Jamie dwells too much on the fart joke. How can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes? After 2 min it becomes worn and so "unfunny". Why does he repeat himself so much with that line, "I am not saying she's a crackhead, just a bit crackish"? It sounds very rehearsed after the second time. If it were only for these errors I would have found the jokes altogether acceptable.  What I found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against Arabs. I am black myself but found some of the jokes about Islam and Arabs to be in bad taste. Jamie could not even get an Arab accent right. C'mon, guys the accent Jamie pulled was an Indian accent and not an Arab accent.  I kept asking myself, "what would black people do if a white comedian (say Robin Williams) makes the same crude jokes about black people?" Would it be acceptable?". I think not. I am sure the black press would slaughter Robin if he did. I wish to call a spade a spade. Nonsensical, crude racist jobs against any ethnic group (black, white, Asian and yes Arabs) are not funny. They degrade and demean. For not even managing to get an Arabic accent, Jamie deserves 2 stars from me. 
 Reading Reclaiming God's Original Intent for the Church  reminds me of panning for gold in a river; there is allot of useless mud and dirt but every once in awhile you come across a tiny gold nugget.  Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I felt like I was simply reading another polemic against The Purpose Driven Church, or two men whine about what they dislike about the "modern" church, instead of really pinpointing what God's intent is.    Three things really aggravated me about this book.  The first was the tremendously poor church history that is implored.  The authors contrast some magical perfect pre-Nicaea church that never existed, against this tremendously flawed corporate "Christendom" that was birthed by Constantine. Their claim, that if only we can shed modernity and get back to our early-church roots is a complete farce, because it fails to understand that the church throughout the ages, yes even the early-church, was made up of sinners.    Secondly, I was offended by the broad generalizations they made.  As a former youth pastor I was insulted by their claim that many youth ministers leave there ministries because they are looking to climb that corporate ladder (118). I don't think the general statements that the authors make in this book are part of God's intent for the church.    Finally, the chapter entitled "It's About Listening-Not Just Preaching" was awful. The authors are correct to say in counseling and evangelism Christians spend way to much time talking instead of listening.  However, they have gotten good counseling confused with good preaching.  As a matter of fact I would argue that one of the reasons the church has become so irrelevant is that there are very few gifted preachers in this country. Romans 10:17 say "faith comes from hearing the message." I would contend that preaching is central when it comes to reclaiming God's original intent for the church.  I will say that I did appreciate their point: that the role of pastor is about a calling and not a career.  I believe there is something to learn from the church of Antioch; that sent people of proven maturity and effectiveness to new areas. I would claim one of God's original intents for the Church is to send young pastors to our modern day Antioch parishes (large and stable churches). And dispatching our pastors of proven maturity and effectiveness to unchurched areas, instead of vice versa.   This book is a quick and easy read; however it does not come close to effectively reclaiming God's original intent for the church!       
 To put it simply, Freedom Evolves is a philosophical failure, with as many holes as a Hollywood movie. I give the book one star for effort, for the attempt to get philosophy to the masses, and for pure entertainment purposes. But I subtract four stars because the premise is yet another arrogant attempt by a philosopher to gain a piece of the philosophical pie, one that I feel was eaten a long time ago, with mere crumbs remaining for contemporary thinkers. Dennett does not by any stretch get a crumb for this one.  Despite the myriad long-winded and frightened attempts to get around the harsh yet incredibly simple reality and logic of determinism, I have yet to see any valid arguments by any philosopher to even begin to disprove it. I'll go so far as to agree that we perceive an illusion of free will due to the individuality in character of each human being, based upon one's initial genetic programming and thereafter one's environmental programming, but that's as far as it can possibly go. We're still bound by cause and effect, just like every single other thing in the universe, "alive" or not. To think or state otherwise is merely another case of human self-flattery and arrogance, and therefore outright ignorance (or, in Dennett's case, opportunism to boot). The potential proof of parallel universes in physics will still have no bearing on the issue. And evolution, as Dennett attempts it, works more against his arguments than for them.  Recommended if you enjoy pop philosophy for clever entertainment only. Otherwise, with all the logical holes in it, you could use the book to strain your spaghetti 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 Well....      I'm not happy with :(   The DVD's are cool indeed but the so cald H3D Viewing system   i don't like, why ?!   Sure i can see depth, sure i can see 3D with it,   But, NOT like in the pictures on the H3D Viewing System Box, nothing comes out of my TV or the so cald  come-off-the-screen effect, that's for sure...   And it's NOT that i plugged it wrong ! Or... i have bad eyes : 
 Set in 1986, Ballad tells the tale of an ailing wealthy counterculture environmentalist (Jack) and his teenage daughter (Rose) living on an abandoned commune. Years ago it was prospering but all the members have left, including jack's wife, and only Jack and Rose remained. They spend their days in quiet contentment, gardening, farming --and launching two-man guerilla attacks on a housing development on the other side of the island.   Living in near isolation, jack and rose develop an incredibly close bond, one that threatens to become incestuous. Terrified of this development, Jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend and her two teenage sons to live with them. The new 'guests' are an unwelcome development to Rose's life. She's incredibly possessive of her father and in retaliation for this intrusion, she tries to seduce the two boys and kill Kathleen (the girlfriend). jack is at wit's end eventually, things cannot go on as they were nor can they continue to coexist in the new situation. He has two choices neither of which are idyll.  This is where the movie goes awry. The movie keeps everything to a very natural level, no overwrought music, and overreactions. This works for most of the movie yet these events are too alarming for the characters to ignore. After Rose tries to shoot Kathleen, all the characters choose to ignore Rose's unhealthy jealousy. They blame her behavior as wild child-ism, the result of being isolated from society for too long. And while this is the case, it is also annoying. The Rose character is too much of a petulant child instead of a wild child. As her acts became increaingly dangerous, the more I wanted someone to finally tell her enough is enough. The character of Jack is equally unlikable. He chooses to ignore his daughter's unhealthy attachment and when he does fully accept it, he continues to encourage it. This may be a fully organic development of the characters and their relationship, but that doesn't mean it's entertaining. Despite the controversial relationship, the movie vacillates between smug and boring.   The performances are good, my favorite are those of Paul Dano, Ryan MacDonald, and Catherine Keener as the girlfriend and her two sons, there's a naturalness to their acting that is oddly lacking in the depictions of Jack and Rose. Perhaps that is intentional. Jack and Rose are not as much real people as they are idealized environmentalist versions of a fairytale king and his daughter, living in grand isolation until the advent of the evil stepmother, Kathleen. Only in this case the stepmother isn't evil and the new family is more entertaining then the main characters.  There is an extraneous subplot with Beau bridges as a housing developer that serves as metaphorical commentary on Jack and Rose's reltionship, but like the rest of the movie it's too smug to be meaningful. 
 This book was written in an obvious "My dad is bigger than your dad" frame of mind.  The author makes not doubt about who he thinks is the "alpha male" in the bunch.  President Clinton made a statement while on Air Force One and it was an opportunity to tell the world about his unsimpathetic words while President Bush is just a stumbling, chokes on himself when talking in public , "Awwww! Shucks that isn't what I meant to say!" kind of a guy.  Pres. Bush can outrun anyone, even in shape well built secret service guys, on his feet or his bike.   	If you're a firm believer in Bush you will love this, I'm a bigger, better man than you, book.  If you're an anti Bush person, you'll see through the bush=sh*% and through it in the trash.  This book made me wonder who wrote it; Bush or Sammon.   
 Well you know the rest. Aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired. These meals CANNOT be done in 30 minutes, unless that is if you want everything half cooked. The book makes false promises and does not deliver. There are also NO PICTURES and NO INDEX and the recipes are very confusing..most of them deriving from an original Master recipe and then just changing one or two things. If you want good food and a good cook book don't buy into the hype and don't buy this book. 
 I learn much more from watching the two great masters in TV than reading their cook books. I was really looking forward to receive these 4-disc DVDs.  Unfortunately when the package arrived, two of the discs were not secured inside the box and there were deep scratches on the surface of the discs.  I returned the set and asked for a replacement.  The second package arrived with the same problem.  A La Carte, the distribution, could have come up with a better packaging than cramping 4 discs inside a single box.  I decided to keep the merchandize because I really treasure this TV series.  But if you are not as crazy as I am, don't buy this set until the distributor comes up with a better package 
 The movie "Flight of Fury" is a festival of bad acting, stock footage and an aging star past his prime by 10 years.    The following are 7 reasons Flight of Fury resembles a poor attempt at making an action movie:     1.  The box depicts a thin Seagal under 300lbs.    2.  Corny airplane on the box cover,which is not even the same plane          in the movie.    3.  A plot that makes no sense.    4.  Seagal has a double for walking in and out of doors and fight         scences.    5.  The double can be clearly seen during fight scences.    6.  Seagal's voice is dubbed at times.    7.  Seagal is always in bad lightening.    8.  NO ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  RENT FLIGHT OF FURY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! IT WILL CAUSE CONFUSION, FRUSTRATION AND A LOSS OF MONEY!!!!!!!!    
 The continually referenced web site says, "Coming Soon." This book may be ok for a full time help author but is very time consuming to find information. CSS, DHTML and HTML Help information is scattered all over the book. The index is of little help. I'm sure someone could build HTML Help if they had years to do it as did the projects the author references. The supposed on-line files might help. I feel very ripped off that the author did not follow through on the website and example files 
 where can i read about this beef and how this release is shady? Ive been looking everywhere and also trying to find the real dr octagon on myspace but there has been nothing. someone please help... thanks! 
 At the risk of sounding like Tom Hanks in "Big"...I don't get it...the girl opens the book and sees the boy who opens the book and sees her...what's the fun of that?  I buy six books every Christmas for nieces and nephews ages 2-8, and I couldn't figure out which of the six would find this book at all interesting...It reminds of the slow pretentious movie the critics love and you go and see it and wonder if there is someplace you could go to get the last 2 1/2 hours of your life refunded 
 This book did not provide me with any valuable information with respect to fireplace design.  I felt the book was vague and the majority of photographs were of traditional fireplaces.  I was looking for contemporary designs and styles that would compliment different room types and configurations.  This book is very predictable in text and in photos, nothing new here 
 Okay...I bought this book to find out how big this tank was!...guess what...nowhere in this book...(a book ON THE SHERMAN TANK no less)...can I find how long this tank is!!!...how wide this tank is. You would think that this would be basic information on the subject. What possible excuse could there be for not having this info readily available in a book on the Sherman tank. Beats me..if anyone can help, please recommend a book where I can find this information 
 When brian goes to his first race in the eclipse there is a song that starts "tell me whats the secret im missing and im...." i would really appreciate it if someone could tell me the name of the song and the artist. Thanks. 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 The back cover of the book says this book will teach Christians to confidently argue against evolution. And there is no doubt neither that Hanegraaf is confident nor that this book will appeal only to Christians, and only to those Christians who are not willing to think rationally and question their beliefs.   Hanegraaf states that the most significant consequence of the theory of evolution "is that it undermines the very foundation of Christianity", and that is the basis for his arguing throughout the book. His arguments are based on the notion that God's existance and the belief that God created the universe must never be questioned. He also argues that believing in the Bible is comforting because you know where you're going, while if you believe in evolution you don't know where the world is headed. This type of arguments are completely unscientific. Science is about what you can prove, not about what you find convenient and comforting to believe.   Hanegraaf obviously has no scientific integrity whatsoever. He has decided that evolution must be wrong, not because he can say anything to disprove it, but simply because it is against the Bible, and he has filled the entire book with this flawed and unscientific rhetoric. No reader - evolutionist or not - with any scientific integrity will be able to take this book seriously. It is completely faith based preaching for the choir, not worth wasting time or money on 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 This is one of the stupidest books I have ever read. The main character, "Fred" the mermaid, is a mass of neuroses. She's bitchy, snide and her responses to the most simple of events is weirdly inappropriate. In the very first scene, this 30 year old ph.D stumbles across her parents having sex and completely freaks out, so much so that she violently (but oh, so amusingly...) attacks them both. Time for little Fred to grow up, I think. The mystery is too easily solved and the men in her life, both instantly, and for no apparent reason, falling in love with her, are simple stereotypes of the gorgeous but smitten male. The first in a series, It seems likely that she'll soon be having a lot of sex with both of them; and simple, brainless pornography is about the best I can hope for from this ridiculous book 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it

 In this book, Mr. Biggs does not discuss the fact that before he left Morgan Stanley he was unmasked as having fabricated comments used in his research reports (claimed to be from his plumber, Ron Valentine) [see NYT, May 21, 2000, Sec 3, p2]. Readers and potential readers of Hedgehogging should, however, remember. It explains the view smart investors have had of Mr. Biggs for some time: he is mildly entertaining, but not someone you should use for serious advice. And above all: never give him any money.  Hedgehogging won't challenge this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, it is about what the author does not say. Nowhere does Mr. Biggs actually detail his hedge fund's strategy or process. His discussion of losses from shorting oil are interesting, but only highlight his lack of thought. Is Mr. Biggs just the public face for Traxis, asking for money for no other reason than he has been around a long time?  It is also about what he does say. Several times Mr. Biggs talks about the "special magic" that it takes to be an investment superstar, most memorably when he talks of the "seeing eye" (p111).  This seems to be his core philosophy. Investment success is not made or created, it just happens to those who succeed.   And it is about his actions. In the end, hedge funds can be judged by only one thing: performance. After initial success with Fairfield Partners, Mr. Biggs does not talk about their returns other than that Fairfield "survived the bear market of the 1970s." He left in 1973. We will all see how Traxis does.  Finally, an attempt to put names to pseudonyms. Most do not precisely match Mr. Biggs' "clues," but many of the details may not be true (remember Ron Valentine). Superstar Ian (p11): J. Kevin Kenny, Jr., Emerging Sovereign Group Grinning Gilbert (p15): Steven Cohen, SAC (fantasy amalgamated with Zalmon Gilbert Simmons) Jock Robinson and Casino Resorts (p35): Robert Wilson and Resorts International Jim the Trigger (p51): Janus alums ala Warren Lammert and Blaine Rollins Peter the Great (p63): Henry Kravis, KKR Tim (p96): Nicolas Roditi The Bearded Prophet of the Apocalypse (p99): Douglas Kass, Seabreeze Julian's Guy (p104): Tiger Cub cocktail with likes of Chase Coleman, Thomas Facciola Dave (p133): David Marvin, Marvin & Palmer Greg from Mega (p192): Leon Cooperman, Omega Judson Thomas and his special Wall Street Journal (ch20):  When first written in 1971, the story was clearly fantasy. But today, it is remarkable how Barton has become Judson. "... a big, beefy middle-aged man, faintly disheveled, his shoes spotted. The face was good - strong, sturdy features arranged honestly - but the eyes had been shot away a long time ago and now there was nobody home a lot of the time... Jud knew all the big names in the game like Kingdon, Cooperman, and Druckenmiller, but they disdained him as a hack." 
 poor production, made in a hurry..  not recommended at least not at that price. 
 I lived this and the outcome.  This book didn't come close to explaining what happened.  2 menny mistaks 
 I'm a big fan of Dan Poynter's book The Self-Publishing Manual, so I expected that this book would be of comparable quality.  Unfortunately, that just isn't the case.  There is some information relating to the "new book model" publication process that should be helpful, but what little information exists is difficult to extract from this book which has been very poorly designed and laid out.  The pages are constantly broken by quotes that loosely relate to the text, and this makes it difficult for the actual content to read smoothly.  The text itself seems disjointed as if Poynter has just copied and pasted passages of previous articles together, and little attention has been paid to making this a coherent and informative book.  The graphics used in the book are of poor quality- an obvious example of someone who doesn't know how to prepare graphics for print and an indication that this book was just slapped together.  I hope this isn't what Dan Poynter means by "The New Book Model", as this was an incredibly disappointing book both aesthetically and as a text.    While I think electronic publishing is a medium that's here to stay and incredibly valuable, I do disagreee with Dan Poynter's assertion in this book that "the only ink-on-paper ('dead tree') books in the future will be coffee table books- books as an art form.  These books will be used to decorate homes and offices.  Other information will be disseminated electronically without sacrificing trees."  Certainly this will never happen as long as "new book model" publishers publish books of this quality.  Consumers will demand books of greater informational value that present the information in an easy-to-absorb and attractive manner, which, I'm disappointed to discover, Dan Poynter is willing to sacrifice.  In any case, the fact is there are actually more trees growing in the United States now as a result of our vast use of paper and lumber than there were 200 years ago.  The "save the trees" argument for e-publishing is just wrong.  There are a lot of good reasons to e-publish, but trees aren't among them.  It's worth noting that far fewer trees would have died in the printing of this book had the author left out the exessive quotes and textboxes that pad this book's page-count.  All in all, I'm disappointed with Writing Nonfiction.  The information in this book that is of any value really belongs in Poynter's infinitely better and more comprehensive book, The Self-Publishing Manual.  One chapter would cover it.  I also recommend Avery Cardoza's The Complete Guide To Successful Publishing.  
 This book should be pulped. Maushart is entitled to her own interpretations of the literature but her analysis falls woefully short, first in her over-reliance upon feminist theories on gender oppression to explain poor or weak marriages; and second from her unwillingness to acknowledge the change happening around her. Maushart seems more of a woman with a grudge to bear than an author with a possibly important message. If her true stories were from the experiences of other women (indicating research), I, for one, might have been able to stomach her biased diatribe. Every choice comes down to a yes or no. Maushart twice said yes. If offered the choice again she should do some research before making a decision 
 This is a wonderful book but I was sad to discover after receiving not only my first order without a CD, but my second REPLACEMENT order as well, that Amazon does not include your CD recording with your purchase as described.  I would recommend searching elsewhere for this book 
 This book doesn't address the condition of man and mans condition as its been forever, as in thousands of years.    and to single out Christianity as war mongers is tarded, the whole world is and has been into wars.    Name ONE century in history, yes all of history, where there has been no wars? ( hint, its zero )   oh yea yea i know the debate, we are getting smarter as people and will stop wars as soon as we get more educated.     below is from another reviewer in here.  To Christian readers I would recommend considering Hillman's view that Christianity has been martial from the start as a challenge to examine the relationship between the Christian emphasis on love and innocence and its long institutional history of intolerance and brutality. Is warfare endemic to Christianity? Are Christians who reject warfare exceptions to an almost universal aggressiveness? Must Christianity be a religion of missionaries who think they know better than the peoples they seek to convert? These are some of the questions raised by Hillman's study.  without even talking to any of you peeps in here that give this book 4-5 stars, I am willing to bet that you also are ok with abortion for any reason the women wants.   Seems to always go hand in hand, hate war, abortions are ok.    Guess what, abortion kills more than all the wars combined.  At least 1.5 million in USA alone.    yea yea I know, overpopulation ( Got War? ) unwanted kids ( 7 year waiting list for adoption ) on and on it goes.   Organized religion is at the head of many of mans problems, if not the most of them.   This includes all religions.   However, the Christ of the bible has nothing to do with organized religion, so hence, you see why we just continue to have problem after problem.   I was raised catholic, bailed to Christianity, went over to right wing Christianity, and bailed out of all named denominations, now it's just flat Christian.  The problem is, not many others are doing this, and wont as I see the world anytime in the near future, so hence, all our problems in the world are going to continue.   Simple as that.    people are confusing getting rid of all religions ( john Lennon Imagine, etc etc ) With the real Christ.   Jesus hated religion, yet his people still want to be a part of it, as they think it keeps them all in line.     I know so many people that were raised in a Christian home, Mormon home, JW home, a Catholic home, and as soon as they became adults, they bailed on all of it.   going over to anything that sans organized religion and is "Just God".       
 I bought Cat Sitter1 for my 3 cats, they enjoyed it so much I gave Cat Sitter 2 a go. What a disappointment!!They were bored within 5 minutes of it being on!  The entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to Cat Sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments. Trust me, if you have to choose between the two, don't spend your money on on CS2, however, it may appeal to the (human) avid bird watcher...(?) 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 This video is just boring. The picture is not to good but watchable. I hope this is the only video this guy ever makes. I do have to give it 2 stars just because it does show a lot of stuff.  They maybe should explain more 
 This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. The book is so repetative. The same event is explained at least three times 
 I have to agree with the reviewer named jrubi02 on this novel. I too am a fan of historical mysteries, and this work, while not without promise, was disappointing. As the other reviewer noted, the catapulting of the main character from a rural servant to being at the center of Tudor intrigue in no time is just too hard to believe. I couldn't get past that basic premise. Additionally, the brazen attitude the main character uses to win the confidence of both future Tudor queens is hackneyed, as is the romantic plot thread.   The author does a nice job of portraying the historical period and is apparently learned in the history of the time. Morevoer, his enthusiasm for his subject is obvious. However, as much as I enjoy the historical characters portrayed in the book, I lost patience with it and didn't finish it. I know the author frequents these Amazon pages, and I hope he will take my critique in the spirit in which it is offered 
 Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out.  Romeo must kiss Juliet.  Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky.  A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers 
 If you want the genuine facts about these people you don't need an outsiders opinion. Speak to them! Ask them to prove their beliefs from the scriptures, go to the source! The fact that they take time out to go to the people, as Jesus did, says alot about them. What are all the other professed Christians doing on weekends? I wonder.. 
 For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3. 
 I thought the book was appropriate for a young adult. I ended up giving it to my neighbors three year old son because it was more of a toddlers picture book. I felt the book was misrepresented online. 
 in this set, which I gave to my daughter for Christmas, when she unwrapped it, the box was broken on two edges.  We are reading book #3 and the pages have begun falling out.  The quality of the set is the problem.  The stories are wonderful 
 At first sight the book seems so insightful - and it clearly stems from a sincere wish to understand other cultures and others holding different views than one's own within one's own culture. But then comes page 20.  Gutmann writes that the task is to rescue us from a world of entrenched  battlefields and point the way to "mutually respectful communities of  substantial, sometimes even fundamental, INTELLECTUAL disagreement"  (my emphasis).  What such a viewpoint does is to limit the discussion to  rational discourse. One can agree on a base-line of open discussion with  those you may be in diasagreement with but only when the 'crazies' have  been left outside, those who preach hatred, or even those who choose to opt  out. This is all what Richard Rorty called 'wet liberalism'. Terribly  disappointing. After Gutmann's intellectualist and ultimately elitist point  of view dawns, the other essays fall within the same light 
 I keep reading Paul Auster's novels for no other reason than to see how he's repackaged his old material (material that was great in the NY3 and Moon Palace and The Music of Chance).  His last 5 novels cover no new ground, and The Brooklyn Follies, with the exception of the downright stupid Timbuktu, is perhaps the worst of them.  Like Auster's never written about characters who've given up on life before, and persist for whatever reason a coincidence propels them into.  Chance, overly symbolic names, mannered writing, cliches, literature essays masquerading as prose dialogue or narrative ... we GET IT, Paul!  You like Kafka, Beckett, Cervantes, Hawthorne, Whitman, Melville, and a bunch of esoteric European poets, et al.  We get it.  Stop.  Please.  Try something new.  And has Auster ever had a protagonist or central character who wasn't either a writer, a wannebe writer, an artist, a wannabe artist, or just an existential avatar, a living ghost?  Yeah, Nathan Glass is a retired insurance man.  Sure.  It's not even close to being believable if you've read all of Auster's novels, b/c it's clear his world is so myopic that the only people he can write about are writers or living ghosts - people like himself.  I'm not sure Auster's even writing his novels anymore.  It's as if The Brooklyn Follies is his confession.  Just as his character, Harry Brightman, worked the art scam, selling replicas of previous successful works, Auster (who is creatively dead) and his publishers seem to be perpetuating the same kind of scam.     
 This review is about the regular edition DVD, not the Criterion one.  The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if they took a pan&scan print and chopped off the top and bottom, like the Back to the Future box set fiasco. I will be comparing to my friend's copy he taped off TV to see if it is so 
 I disagree with the other reviews of this book.  It is even-handed only if you consider damning with faint praise to be even-handedness.  Brock's thesis is that while Bill Clinton is a sleaze bag; Hillary is a sincere committed radical--sort of a Emma Goldman with a law degree.  While he does at times acknowledge that a double standard has been applied to the Clintons, as compared for example to the Bushes, he repeatedly denigrates Hillary by resorting to guilt by association.  He trots out every associate she has ever had who has been involved in any liberal or left-wing cause and gives you their background in lurid detail.  According to Brock, Hillary's intellectual development stopped in college or law school.  I await his new book to see whether he really is ready to write an even-handed appraisal of the current political scene.  In this book, he assumes that the liberals are naive or out to destroy basic American values.  For example, he assumes that there wasn't  merit at all to the Vietnam war protests or that anyone could actually believe that the war was both immoral and not in the interests of the United States of America.--Arthur Amcha 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  It doesn't provide the real world facts about making an indie film as other books do.  It reads like an introductory textbook that skates over all the issues, but never really tells you the things you want to know about how to finance, cast, and sell an indie.  Don't waste your money here 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 I, too, live by the beach and appreciate the fun and beauty and solace it offers beyond measure. And while I'm sure that the Hubals are wonderful people, this book is unbelievably trite and oozes with over-the-top sentimentality. For example, #88 titled Cry or #93, "Make a wish and write in the sand with a feather." Entries also lean to the bizzare: #87 "Let a child take pictures of you"--the Hubals suggest "borrowing a child from a friendly family" if you don't have a child of your own. And #83--I agree watching dogs play at the beach is entertaining, but the mention that your dog will be delighted that there are "dead things to smell"is just too too much. And #79: "Give some money away" never even mentions the beach or the ocean--were editors sleeping during this tangent? For those of you who are Saturday Night Live fans, this book puts "Deep Thoughts" to shame. Unless you're looking for a good laugh or enjoy the sappiest of sappy books, pass this one up 
 This book is very religious. I would return it but the shipping and handling costs more than the book itself. Stay away from this book unless you want a book totally based on the christian way of life 
   Does anyone actually listen to this before they make it into CD's?  This is the poorest quality band music I've ever heard!  The EQ is moronic.  The high end needs to be cut by at least 12 db's.  The fidelity is lousy.  Sounds like it was recorded with one microphone, and there is definately some clipping going on.  How could Altissimo do this to this great music?? 
 I had heard a few songs from Songbook in the store, and decided to try this 'live' album.  Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing.  Nothing of the magic that was Songbook.  Capable note-wise, Cassidy's delivery is however, very unmoving here.  It was, and is, very annoying, that I keep imagining this was all sung by Ann Wilson (of rock band Heart).  But this is the wrong kind of music for a voice like that; i.e. she doesn't sound good live 
 I generally read non-fiction, and on occasion I will read some historical fiction to get a better feel for a particular time. That was my aim with this book. Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me. At first, the book held promise, cleverly weaving back and forth between concurrent events at various locales. However, after a while the book started to lose credibility. The main plot line and main motivation for the majority of the book was an invention of the author. Also, the characters start to talk with this "post-modern relativity" that just doesn't fit in with the period.  By the end of the book, I couldn't care less about the characters because I couldn't relate to the choices they were making. They made no sense to me, particularly when coupled with 21st century psychobabble. I have no interest in reading the sequel 
 When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it.  
 I am a 76-year-old Jew who grew up in East Baltimore, surrounded by Eastern European Jewish immigrants.  Avalon depicted almost none of the typically Jewish experiences I recall from my youth:  the seder at my great grandfather's table, the after school lessons at the Baltimore Talmud Torah, Yum Kipur services at the synagogue just up Baltimore Street from by grandmother's house, my bar mitzvah, etc., etc.  Where was the Jewishness I expected to see?  Not in this noisy, confusing chazerai 
 I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all. However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet.   I would say it should be called Salty Corn. I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn.  Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line.   ** My  Favorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend .. 
 I have attempted this book several times, it is abysmal. There are many other horrible books I have read and finished (not by Anne Rice), desperately hoping for something redeeming to occur at the end, which rarely ever happens. With Violin, I couldn't force myself to complete it, it was that bad. The most sustained effort I have made got me roughly 150 pages in before I had to put it down and move on. The character rambles and rambles and goes nowhere except to rehash her previous ramblings. I am a huge Anne Rice fan, not just of her vampire books. I have read everything she has published under her own name and loved it. When her descriptions become verbose and poetic, I'm in heaven, I love her ability to paint mundane things in a beautiful light. Her accounting of the family history in The Witching Hour is amazing, especially considering there is no action, just exquisite description. This book had none of that, it was painful to read in the worst way. Shortly after this book was published, I read in the news about how Ms. Rice was a diabetic and had been unaware of this for some time. Her untreated diabetes had caused massive depression and I believe this book is a reflection on the mental anguish she was going through. It is not beautiful, not poetic, and worst of all, not interesting. If you are browsing for a good Anne Rice novel, I beg you, pick anything she has written other than this one. 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our class.  He was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the Metro.  If he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, I think he would have much more success as an author 
 I really don't see how anyone can say that William Carlos Williams' "The Red Wheelbarrow" is an outstanding peice of work. I'm not going to trash the rest of his work because I find some of it to be quite good, but I would love to know how on earth that poem got published. I find it pointless and quite frankly, boring. And how people get three-page analyses of this poem leaves me in utter amazement that there actually are people with no life 
 I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him. Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook (though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can't cover up your mediocrity. The only time i'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost. Stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing. An insult to classic songs 
 I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.  The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.  It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.   I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.   Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated 
 This history of the Reformation is a scholarly document and many reviewers have praised its quality. I found it to be comparable to milk in a locked refrigerator...you know its there...but its just not accessible. Mr. MacCulloch's research is exhaustive, however, his ability as a writer does not offer the reader any real discernment of either the forest or the trees. If your goal is understanding what happened in the 16th century, I suggest a much briefer history by Glenn S. Sunshine, who indeed, does present a much more enlightening work. Great scholarship, in the case of Mr. MacCulloch, is cloaked in the mediocrity of his writing skill.  
 bought this disc on the recommendations of fellow listeners on Amazon....came away unimpressed; in fact, puzzled as to why anyone would think this a great record.  save for a couple of songs, you can't hear the crowd, Jerry Jeff's "voice" is average at best, and the general songwriting/lineup for this album is mundane.  I'm sure this guy has talent and would welcome any tips on other records from this artist but this one??? no thank you 
 So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say "Hurrah" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much "muchiness" as the Brits would say 
 This is a nothing book, I mean literally, this book contains NOTHING.  No story.   No plot.   No ending.  INCEST?.....there is none, there are not even any people in it 
  Throughout the ages, most humans have considered their religious worldview the one true Way.  This has led to three different modes of thinking: Those who believe that the truest way is to serve all gods and include all religious thoughts, those who believe only one god -their own- should be served, and those who thought all religions too confusing, contradictory or fraught with error to be a reliable guide to understanding the world.  Frances Sheridan Goulart's "God Has No Religion: Blending Traditions for Prayer," falls securely in the first category. This is the way of Hinduism and those who are inclined to mixing religious traditions without regard to the moorings of those traditions will certainly like this book. This volume tackles an important but sensitive question: How to pray, what to pray, and how to pray in a way that is real and satisfying to the individual, and how to  apply those practices one values from another tradition. "God has no religion" builds on such books as the Oxford Book of Prayer by containing traditional and modern prayers from other traditions, but Goulart goes further in that she does not make Christianity the primary focus of her collection, and she crafts exercises to challenge participants to step out of their own spiritual tradition. After three introductory chapters which deal with prayer practices, she gets down to the core of the book which are a collection of prayers. Each prayer comes from a specific tradition and is accompanied by a brief Origin note and Options which aid the seeker to flex spiritual muscles. Often the prayers contain italicized sections which the author suggests can be changed to another tradition or removed.   The book's intention seems to be to help the religious seeker better capture the infinite varieties of human worship.   In the first chapter, "Prayers and Praying in the Twenty-first Century" Goulart states, "twenty-first century seekers revere the past but aren't held hostage by it. Almost half of all Americans under thirty, and one-third of those over seventy, think the best religion is one that borrows from all religions." Such statements will make the analytical reader suspicious. Goulart deftly manages not to name the study. Furthermore, while only one sentence specifies "Americans," that specification is so closely linked to "twenty-first century seekers" that a subtle mismanagement of statistics becomes immediately apparent. Although evangelical Christianity and fundamentalist Islam are rising in many non-western culture, it is clear that to Goulart only American societal development that matters. Americans who can distance themselves from the American tendency to believe that "where America goes, the world follows" will be offended at Goulart's apparent western solipsism. Later when Goulart's imprecise writing melds with the American solipsism, we encounter this "Holier-than-thou" spiritual comparison:  "21 percent of us think we are more spiritual than our elders." Presumably a book about spiritual diversity should avoid spiritual comparisons. By the time I finished the preface, and read Goulart's definition of "Blessed be" as "A Feminist way of blessing what has passed and what's to come" I had grown so wary about the author's, imprecise writing, lack of directness, and casually-tossed off statistics that only advertising executives, journalists, fact-checkers, and teachers reading term papers would understand my annoyance. Certainly, it would have been more honest to state that "Blessed Be" is of wiccan or neo-pagan origin. I found myself researching almost every prayer or commentary in Goulart's book. Never had I dreamed I would thumb through Vine's Expository Dictionary, the Book of Common Prayer, Greek Dictionaries, and the Oxford Book of Prayer while reviewing a book.   Goulart abridges several prayers and gives adaptations of others. Comparing the wording of prayers in God Has No Religion with the same prayers in the primary sources, I noticed that Goulart made some interesting changes. For instance, Goulart's version of one prayer --"For Today" reads thusly: "O God: Give me strength to live another day; Let me not turn coward before its difficulties." But in the Book of Common prayer, it actually reads: "O God: Give me strength to live another day; Let me not turn coward before its difficulties or prove recreant to its duties." It's a small change but a telling one.   In the Options section of each page, Goulart gives the reader the opportunity to pick and choose what aspect of a certain prayer to remove. It is probably understandable to many seekers that Goulart should "adapt" The Lorica of St Patrick - a prayer soaked in Christian symbols- but her adaptation so frees the prayer from its moorings that the reader wonders if perhaps Goulart hasn't gone too far. There is so much heavy-duty tampering that her "abridgment" of the Lorica that St Patrick seems more of a worshiper of Gaia than a Christian. And the fact that she doesn't acknowledge that the portion of the prayer she chose is so unlike the major heart of the prayer, makes the reader cringe. Here was censorship by misdirection. Oftentimes, the abridgement and adaptations not only gut the traditional heart of a prayer but they soft-soap the worshipers' duty towards the Supreme Being. For instance, when Goulart abridges Michelle Balek's interreligious prayer "A Prayer For Global Restoration," the hard-hitting aspect of the prayer is removed. Certainly a modern interreligious prayer is already so inclusive, Goulart doesn't need to further strip it.   The author's choice of modern prayers can also be suspect. In describing the origin of a prayer entitled Heart of Compassion, Goulart writes "This prayer is inspired by the belief that Jesus' position as a son of Mary rather than of Joseph in Jewish Palestine suggest that Jesus was perceived as illegitimate and suffered with Mary the rejection of society. His compassion for women and children may have stemmed from this experience." Even if we ignore the Biblical fact that neither enemies nor apostles ever hinted that Jesus was illegitimate (quite the contrary- the people in his hometown called him The Carpenter's Son) the scrutinizing reader is left wondering what exactly does Goulart mean by "the belief" ? Whose belief? The belief of the people in Mary's day? The belief of the one who wrote the modern prayer? And how are we to understand the phrases, "The belief suggests" or "may have stemmed"  Suggests to who?   Another moment of suspicion arises in the Origin section of "Forgive Us Our Debts," where Goulart writes "A translation from the original Aramaic by Neil Douglas-Klotz" of the line "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" from the Our Father. What was translated from the Greek as debts or offenses can actually be understood as "hidden past" "secret debt" and `inner fruit.'" While I'm open to finding the therapeutic in the Lord's Prayer, Douglas-Klotz' mistranslation of a word which means "a debt owed but unpaid" as "secret debt" is clearly at odds with the meaning found in every Greek Bible dictionary. It's not that Goulart has considered a modern prayer as traditional, it's that she often bypasses those aspects of a prayer she considers inconvenient and often uses the idiosyncratic beliefs of untraditional clerics and contributors.   The organization of the materials, and the resources will make this book much loved by the uncynical searcher, but those who understand that we live in an age of generalized truthiness, an age of almost-true memoirs, and scripted reality shows will find themselves like the Berean synagogue searching the Scriptures to see if those things are so. The prayers listed in the book do indeed have a form of godliness and are of the sort the comfortable healthy westerner would admire: but they do not speak to those who live oppressed by sickness, poverty, disease, sin. One wishes Goulart had had the moral courage to not use words so slickly and to leave the many prayers as she found them. Why hide the origin of "Blessed Be" for instance? In her attempt to market the idea of blending traditions together, she has created a collection which is not only clearly suspect but a book of prayers spoken to a vague, undemanding, filtered and stripped-down God.   Not recommended.   
 This CD presents the magnificent voice of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and some of his regular musical family playing with Western musicians, and treated to the "enhancements" of studio technicians and DJs.  For those unfamiliar with him this may well be a knock-your-socks-off experience.  However, for those who have been followers of Nusrat's career this is watered down stuff indeed.  It is ironic that after the usual diddling/remixing which seems a necessary part of pop music recording today that the result should be such a limp product compared to his "old fashion" performances.  Clearly producer Michael Brook simply wasnt up to dealing with the incandescent power of the real Nusrat.  If you think this slick production is great stuff - listen to his untampered with qawwali recordings and have your heart medication handy, 'cause you ain't heard nothin yet 
 Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday.  I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11, but these are waaayyyyy too tight.  I am going to need to send them back for a larger size.  I am going to try a size 12, but am afraid that they'll still be a little small 
 This is a topic that has a lot of promise and one can do so much with it. However, if you're looking for anything more than just the basics (with a few good examples from social statistics), don't bother with this book. This book starts out by identifying the reasons why statistics get distorted, but then after every 20 pages or so this book reads like the script of groundhog day - the same three points (innumeracy, people with a vested interest and apples and oranges comparisons) are referenced again and again. The topic is fascinating but there is very little substance to keep you occupied for more than 30 minutes 
 This book is pretty pathetic. Writing style is cheesy and even ridiculous at times. Waste of time 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 I am a wife who was cheated on. How pathetic that there is a book out there to help the other woman. Don't waste money on this book as I will give you advice for free. Ready? Don't date married men you slimeballs 
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 Um, guys?  Isn't this the guy who testified with David Kay to Congress about "Saddam's nuclear program?"  So, um, now we know there was no program, right?  Which the CIA knew years ago, when Saddam's son-in-law defected.  So this book is, what exactly?  And how stupid are the reviewers below?  "Reads like a spy novel" indeed.  Apparently, this guy is still on the taxpayer's payroll, in charge of "re-educating" Iraqi scientists 
 The title intrigued.  The book . . . not really a book but a group of essays, one of which provided the title . . . disappointed.  Spending ten pages of fine print on the exact definition of a word left me a bit angry -- angry that I do not have the courage to toss a book that I have paid for and started to read 
 In a series that for many years was one of my very favorites this is one title I never cared for. The reason is simple, Quill comes off as such a total jerk. If the main character comes off as unlikeable it's hard to much care about what happens. I will give one example of what I am talking about. In this book there is a sucicide. This man just walks out on his wife and child to live in Pickaxe for no reason what so ever. { All this is set up in The Cat Who.. Talked to Ghosts} When his wife lets him know she will not take him back he kills himself and Quill makes the wife into a heel as if this mans own actions had nothing to do with the situation. It was at that point I stopped reading. For some I am sure this would be perfectly fine but it stuck in my craw. But of the first 14 books in the series this is the only one I would not recomend 
 A lot has transpired since Richard Rovere died in 1979 that makes his book outdated and irrelevant: Venona and the disintergration of the Soviet Union, for example.  Both have put paid to such questions as "if there were Communists in the State Department." Arthur Herman's book "Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator" --using the revelations and documents from the former Soviet Union-- clarified these issues once and for all. McCarthy may have been an eccentric demogogue and an alcoholic (so what makes him different from many other politicians?) but history shows that he got it essentially right. Diehard communists, progressive communist sympathizers and all those misguided souls that believed and still believe that it was a "noble" cause-- will never forgive him for getting it right 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Benson has managed to remind me of Dan Brown, with all of the bad writing and none of the interesting research. The premise seemed interesting--tale set in the future and the past, with similar events.   Unfortunately, the writing was so bad that I, as a respectable Creative Writing major at a university, could not get through more than the first five pages. If you like endless cliches, bad dialogue, and thousands of thoughts in italics, pick up the new John Grisham and skip this mediocre tale. 
 I would give this more than one star, if I liked more than 2 to 3 tracks. The purpose of these compilations is to enjoy all the best music from an artist album of that year. But what if thier best is their worst? The only artist who was worth my time, was Gangstarr, Westside Connection, and Ja. But I have those albums and I rather listen to those, then a whole entire album it will take less than 9 mins, to go through the whole thing 
 It looks fun in the picture, but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire.  Within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle.  This toy should be recalled.  Do not buy it. I would send mine back, but we had already thrown out the packaging 
 I can't believe I spent good money on this vacuum.  I've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems: why it won't vacuum without pushing it with all my might, why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children, why the filter won't stay in place, and why it SMELLS LIKE BURNED RUBBER every time am forced to use it.  I have replaced every filter and belt.  Now I am going to throw it away.  I'd gladly give it to charity, but I can't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim 
 I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring 
 The book is AMAZING!  The CD is HORRIBLE!  Stick to reading the book yourself.  I have over 45 audio books...and this was like listen to a bad commercial.  I had to turn it off. There is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading.  They don't even state who the narrator is!  I recommend the book to anyone.  The content is life changing 
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 I saw this movie in the theater, when it first came out, and thought it was a good movie! I bought it, advertised as an all-new, fully loaded and FULLY EXPOSED EDITION!  What I saw, was the same movie, and if they showed anymore, then in the original movie, I never saw anything different!  Checking to see that this is 2007, and on top of it, a European movie, one would expect to see, as the viewers in the movie itself saw, THE FULL MONTY!    But did I expect too much, to see, a fully nude male, from the front, which, at least in this country, the U.S. is like showing the Holy Grail.  Women, of course, are fair game, showing them fully nude, dancing together or kissing each other!  Have men do any of this, and American audiences gasp, and giggle nervously. Show a few limbs and heads getting cut off, with blood spurting, and people clap for more!    Do we wonder why record breaking violence keeps increasing?  If you enjoy 2 discs that contain dated boring details, and don't own the original DVD release, you might have waited for nothing!  The opportunity to update it, and show what we've all seen before, especially in this innocent and inspiring story line was missed! Yes, I truly felt ripped-off!     
 I read this book shortly after I read Devil in the Blue Dress.  These are the only two Mosley books that I have read.  First, let me say that I admire those novelists who do not stick to a formula of the same character, same type of plot, same type of result, etc., etc  (e.g., Tom Clancy, & Patrick Robinson).  However, that does not mean that Mosley will score big for every effort.    I very much enjoyed Devil in the Blue Dress, and I wanted to like Walkin' the Dog, but it didn't happen.  The author presented a good study of the street language used by his main character and supporting characters.  The first half of the book was able to easily keep my interest.    The problem was that the author never decided to make a novel out of his short stories.  This resulted in story lines that disappeared and the regurgitating of previously expressed ideas so that I sometimes dreaded turning the next page.  How many times did we need to know that Socrates (the main character) is a big, black, "bad man" who has done bad things in his past?  Yes, he's big, I get it!  He's black, I figured....  Also, months and years seemed to pass without notice or explanation.    The other problem is that the writer wanted to make Socrates a unique philosophical figure.  His philosophical ideas, though, are hardly original, complex, or Socratic.  The author also has the character use some misleading ideas of Afrocentrism to support his beliefs (e.g., that St. Augustine was black because he was from Africa.  He was from the coastal area now known as Algiers, but that would not make him black as anyone familiar with Algiers would know).  The latter is not a major problem, but by that time in the story, I was a little irritated by the flow of the book.  In sum, I am pleased that Mosley sought a different type of story, at least he is trying to be a legitimate author.  He just missed the mark with this book.  
 If you look at the March 2004 issue of the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, you'll find a very negative review of this book. Given that the reviewer (Herbert Leon MacDonell, the Director of Laboratory of Forensic Science  Bloodstain Institute of Corning, New York) and all members of IABPA actively work in the field of forensics, I'd take their word for it. Here's an excerpt from the review, which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdf  "Many fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them. It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information."   The reviewer goes on to say:  "...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are. It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book, that they should trash it. 
 As one other reviewer notes, it's incredibly poorly written. The info is not new, not helpful, not... well, let's just say I saw it a conventional (offline, independent) bookstore, thought it was a cute title, and, being as short on time that day as I almost always am short on sleep, I didn't leaf through it before buying it. MISTAKE!   I really resented paying money for this piece of self-congratulatory-ness. I'm glad the author found something that worked for him, I'm glad he suffered and then interrupted the cycle: hooray for anyone who does that, in any area of life. But it sure didn't do anything for me, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.   Aggravating waste of trees.  
 I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate 
 THROUGH THE YEARS I'VE READ, RE READ AND KEPT SEVERAL OF C.C. BOOKS FOR THE ENJOYMENT I RECEIVED IN READING THEM.  LATELY THOUGH, I'VE HAD A HARD TIME REMEMBERING I EVEN READ SOME OF HER LAST BOOKS.  I'VE JUST ORDERED BLINDSIDE, FORGETTING I'VE ALREADY READ IT.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT WAS NOT ONE I KEPT FOR RE READING.    BLOW OUT FALLS IN THE SAME CATEGORY.  GOOD CRIME SCENES, BUT NOT ANY REASON FOR THE MURDERS OF THE JUDGE AND HIS STAFF.   AND ONCE AGAIN ANY [...] COULD HAVE READ THIS BOOK WITH OUT THE WORRY OF EVEN SIMPLE SEX SCENES.  THERE WAS NO SEX.  NOT BETWEEN THE MARRIED FBI AGENTS NOR THE SINGLE D.C. AGENT AND THE FEMALE REPORTER. (THE JUDGES STEP DAUGHTER)  AND I COULD NOT GET PAST THE REASONS FOR HER TAGGING ALONG WITH THE FBI AGENTS AS THEY DID THEIR JOBS.  UNLESS IT WAS TO DODGE BULLETS AND HAVE LIMPID CONVERSATIONS WITH HER "LOVE INTEREST"  IF YOU PAY MORE THAN A DOLLAR FOR THIS BOOK, YOU ARE PAYING MORE THAN YOU SHOULD.     LETS HOPE C.C. WILL RECAPTURE THE ROMANCE (ANY WOULD HELP) AND BRING BACK HER EARLIER WRITING SKILLS. 
 Unless you like ultra modern home designs, skip this book. The plans are impractical, especially with respect to kitchen layouts. Most of the homes have no vestibules in their entrances, which are a neccessity in colder climates 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  First of all, too much time was spent writing about people/things that you would never hear about again after the first few chapters (i.e. Terrence, Sabrina, Rebecca, etc.).  Granted the author was setting the scene, but this book was not worth it.  I couldn't relate to the characters in any way except for Pearl and Patrick.  They seemed like the only normal and down to earth characters written.  This book is an example of how the highest people up (even African Americans) have more problems/self esteem issues than people who don't live lavish lives.  Barbara Bentley, an extremely passive woman when it came to her husband Bradford "The Rich Dog" Bentley, as I call him.  There is no way I would have allowed him to continue to do the things that he did.  Please don't say that she stayed for the money because as much dirt that she had on Bradford, she would have ended up with the house, a car, a resort/vacation home, and spousal or alimony support all at the voluntary expense of Bradford just to avoid humility.  Jolene was a straight up you know what!  This is a woman who would go to great lengths to live the life she never had, so she thought.  Let me run across a man like Patrick, and he wouldn't have even thought about looking at Pearl.  Although I did like that they hooked up, so I think.    This book was so open ended that you don't know what happened to whom.  It better be a sequel to this book, but unfortunately I not that interested in reading it.  The only reason I read this was for a book club meeting.  Being as though I live in P.G. County, it made me questions the author's motive.  To me the book was written from a condescending point of view of people who live in P.G. County a.k.a. "inside the beltway" as she would put it.  It's funny because even people who live in P.G. County don't refer to it in those terms, but then again maybe they do just not from the outside of the gated communities.  ** A note to all readers...This is a message from the avid readers association, DO NOT waste your time, unless you have time to kill and a book with no ending!** 
 Despite all of the hype, I found this book to be wordy, convoluted, and devoid of clarity.  Sure, some of the concepts are useful, but they are presented in such a self-important and unconvincing style that they are  useless.  Any normal person would get lost in all of the acronyms and  made-up new language.  Phrases like "autocatalytic loops generating  stable, healthy memes for robust self-organization" abound on every  page.  This book is for Ivory Tower theorists, not for somebody trying to  run a business and manage a business.  These may indeed be "big  ideas", as a recent WSJ review states, but those ideas need a new  voice... 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 The Def Jam Poetry series is done to death. Now there is a book. Enough already! The editor who put this together should know when enough is enough 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Giving you a brief rundown where I stand, I thought Part 1 was pretty good; part 2 had some interesting things about it; I didn't much like Part 3; part 4 started to pick up the pace again; part 5 was surprisingly good; I think Part 6 was arguably the best; I didn't like part 7. This 8th chapter was a little better than part 7, but that is not saying much. The story begins with Jason being brought back to life with the help of electricity. (This reuses the technique from Part 6, but it doesn't bring back the same impact.) Jason claims his 1st 2 victims and then makes his way to a boat full of teenagers heading towards New York. Here, the story starts to lose credibility. At least Part 6 made sense when he headed back to Crystal Lake: "Jason will return to the area that's familiar to him. No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him." (So, in this 8th chapter, why does Jason go out of his way to board a ship heading for New York?) I know some people thought it was interesting to see Jason aboard a ship, and that it added something to see Jason's potential victims trapped on a ship. I admit this is a valid defense for the movie, but my question is: "Why did Jason go out of his way to board this ship in the first place?" Moving on, one of Jason's possible victims is a fairly well developed character (Rennie) who has a tragic past with water, and has hallucinations of Jason. Alright, I admit this is one interesting thing. Rennie's uncle Charles is not exactly the nicest person. (But unlike Dr. Cruise from Part 7, at least Charles has some redeeming features. At times, his concern for Rennie seems genuine; when Sean's father is killed, Charles takes a moment to offer a bit of sympathy; and at times, he is concerned over the safety of others.) Another interesting character is Sean (the son of the captain). He wants to please his father, but feels he will be unable to become the captain that his father is. However, becoming the captain his father wants him to may be the only way to save at least a few of the people on the ship. Alright. Another redeeming feature. Moving on, there is the typical high body count, but 5 people manage to escape to New York City. Unfortunately, they run into 2 thugs who rob them and run off with Rennie. (Another redeeming moment for Charles is at least he shows discretion in trying to rescue Rennie.) Naturally, it isn't long before Jason arrives in New York City. Another problem I have with this movie is: "Why does Jason go out of his way to hunt down these 5 people in a whole city?" At least the previous movies made sense. Early in Part 2 we learn that Jason will take revenge on anyone who enters his territory again. And in Parts 2, 3, 4, 6, and even 7, at least Jason was staying in his own domain attacking anyone who happened to be there. To be sure, in Part 6, Jason did attack some people away from the camp grounds, but at least he was on his way back to the area that was familiar to him. Moving on, there was one other element I had to admit was somewhat redeeming. We all know Jason is a brutal killer, but in one scene he is portrayed as almost heroic when he unwittingly saves Rennie from the two thugs that kidnapped her and were trying to rape her. (Interesting twist I admit.) I'll admit it was comical when 2 of the last 5 people screamed for help because they were being chased by a murderer, and a waitress could only say: "Welcome to New York." And of course, in a typical Friday the 13th fashion, 2 people manage to survive the massacre and come out alive. I'll admit this isn't the worst Friday the 13th. (That honor is shared between Parts 3 and 7.) I'll conclude by saying that this 8th chapter does have some redeeming moments, and you may find it to be an interesting twist. But you have to be willing to swallow some things that aren't consistent with the rest of the series. If you're willing to do this, then you will probably will enjoy it more than I did.   
 I do not recommend this book to anyone who has more than very basic knowledge of the computerized digital process.  In addition, the book contains nice examples but no useful ways to get there on your own.  I have purchased the book and read it but did not find it useful.  I was disappointed 
 Very brief, short on content, and does not go beyond basic common workout and health knowledge. This book could only benefit those with no knowledge of PJ's and CCT's due to it's short overview of the programs which could be found by searching the Net anyhow. The workouts that are included are very basic and could be created by oneself with any knowledge at all of running and calisthenics. I am about to go into the PJ Indoc program, from my view the book would be a lot better if it went into the day-to-day lives of the PJ's and CCT's and offered more information and tips on prepping for the constant rigors they go through 
 I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead.  What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.  I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing.  I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 I wish I could have paged through this book before I got it.  Based on the title, I was hoping that the book would discuss economic developments, new markets, new theories, or new technologies that would lead met to make better investments.  Instead, I'd call this book more of a "technical analysis" piece.  It's basic premise is that stocks move in 20 year cycles, and the cycle for large cap growth stocks ended in 2000.  Therefore, put your money in small cap stocks and large cap value.  It's possible that some readers who invest in mutual funds will find this book useful, although they would have been better served had it been published in 2000.  However, the book does not discuss, let alone even reference, techniques of analyzing individual stocks.    So what if many stocks got creamed in 2000? You didn't need to be a market historian to see that coming when p/e ratios and other indicia of valuation were so out of whack.  Anyone following the value methodologies of Ben Graham ("Intelligent Investor") or Chris Browne ("Little Book of Value Investing") avoided getting slammed.    The book's basic premise is that by market timing specific sectors, individual investors can achieve outsized returns.  I am skeptical that most investors will find this to be the case.   Even the title to this book is arguably misleading.  The book is not truly contrarian - it's about interpreting historic market trends to predict the future.  Anyone who has read a mutual fund prospectus can tell you that the SEC requires a statement to the effect that "past performance does not indicate future results" - readers would be well advised to keep that warning in mind.    If you want to read good books on contrarian investing, get David Dreman's "Contrarian Investing Strategies: the Next Generation," or one of the numerous books on behavioral finance that are available (example: Belsky & Gilovich's "Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes" or Paulos' "A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market.").  Sadly, I wish I had taken a pass on this book 
 I returned this item because it was too big for the Brother ES2000 sewing machine I bought.  It was very bulky and took up way too much room.  The machine rattled inside the case and slipped around. It would probably be better for a larger machine 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 First things first: this compilation shouldn't even be called Jermaine Dupri Presents... because JD is only involved with two songs on here (he stars in "Gotta Getcha", and he produces one other song). Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1; whether he was just thinking about "the way we were", or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent. Actually, maybe I shouldn't have said the latter, because it looks like JD dug up some of the most UNtalented people ever.  But things aren't very inspiring with the known artists, like when J-Kwon and Daz try to save "10 Toes". And I wonder how long ago that song was made because in it, J-Kwon says he's 17, but that's how old he was when "Tipsy" came out. I don't know WHY JD decided to dig up has-beens KP & Envyi for the dismal "Put Cha Hands Up" (that title even sounds like it came from 1997), and as for "I Think They Like Me", if it's really Dem Franchize Boyz' song, how come they're the only ones in there that can't rap?  Most of the rappers on here are unknowns, but in the end they really aren't WORTH knowing because even JD is a better rapper than they are. Miss B's "Grown Man" suffers from a corny chorus, and T. Waters' "Throw'd Off" is just plain wack. And Cato's lazy "So What" made me say just that. But the album's nadir is the title track, performed by Young Capone, Midnight, Champagne Shawty and C-Dirt. Not only is there lackluster production, but the guys' rapping is so bad that they make Chingy look like Rakim.  The only saving grace to this whole compilation is Bun-B's verse on the otherwise terrible "Kodak Moment". Unlike that title, though, this album isn't anything to remember. If Jermaine ever makes a Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 2, I'll be the first person not to get it.  Anthony Ruper 
 The lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real Edward R. Murrow, and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the `50s, but otherwise I'd didn't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short, boring movie that seemed much longer.  Maybe I've just seen too many biopics lately 
 If I understand the author correctly, he believes that he is refuting the notion that Freud assumed that his patients' memories of childhood sexual abuse were false. But it is not correct for the author to say that Freud made such an assumption, because in the New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (Strachey translation), in the section on neuroses, it clearly states that Freud believed that in many cases, the abuse did in fact occur. What Freud is saying is that for the purposes of therapy, it essentially does not matter whether the abuse actually happened or not, only that the patient believes that it happened based on his/her memories, which sometimes do not correspond to actual fact. Unfortunately, due to such innacuracies, as well as sounding like a zealot, and playing the feminist issue as a trump card to boot, the author has in the main failed in a task that could have yeilded truly positive results. The author, as a supposed expert on Freud's writings, should know better than to present such innacuracies as above. 
 This shirt is one of a kind.  It was the only dark navy shirt with a large Chicago Bears logo on it that I could find.  It was a little large for me, but looked great the first time I wore it.  However, after just one wash, some of the logo started peeling off!  I can't imagine what this shirt will look like after next season, probably will just be a navy long sleeve shirt...buy this shirt with caution 
 I received this tablet and it looked real good I loved it --I pluged it in to the computer and put CD's in and nothing--the CD's did nothing the WACOM tablet doesn't work so here I am with the tablet the mouse and the pen sitting by my computer and out the money wondering why I even bothered buying this thing in the first place -don't try it because you might just get I did --a WACOM tablet that doesn't work and then you are out the money plus  figuring  out how to get your money back or how to get in touch with the sellers!!  I have tried and there are no answers anywhere there are no phone numbers to call for help---no numbers for trouble shooting you are on your own no return numbers or adresses you are left with this so think again before you waste your mone 
 I am a huge Barbara Kingsolver fan and have read all of her other books.  But I just couldn't get past even the first essay in the book.  I am sure it is just a different style of writing--essay versus novel.  People who usually like essays may like it.  But to me it was just a lot of prattling about nothing in particular.  Give me a plot 
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 I thought this was a good guide to snorkeling on Maui until I got to Maui and my brother had "Maui Revealed."  Maui Revealed is a guidebook that is not limited to snorkeling, but surprisingly, its coverage of snorkeling sites is much more complete than Snorkel Maui.  For instance, at La Perouse Bay, there are many coves that are wonderful that can only be reached by hiking.  Snorkel Maui won't get you there.  Maui Revealed will.  I would pass on this book 
 These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD 
 I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term, risky cells. It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I'm not willing to chance it again 
 This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing 
 This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible.  But this movie is that bad.  I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.  The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing???  What was that all about?  Was that supposed to be funny?  Who wrote this anyway?  He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.  The acting was also some of the worst I've seen.  I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.  Oh, the explosions were impressive.  Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.  Thanks.  I feel a little "dumber" for having sat through the whole thing 
 This book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog 
 This book is terribly repetitive and trite.  There are 3, maybe 4, pages of material that are worthwhile.  I am sure it is just a rehashing of the same thing that Zelinski "writes" every 3 or so years when his funds start to draw down 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.    "Anthropophagus" may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes, so the gore-hound shouldn't be disappointed with this flick.  However, with that being said, "Anthropophagus" simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience, and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love.  Ultimately, what you have in "Anthropophagus" is horrible acting, a poorly written screenplay, uneven and poorly developed plot and action, below average plot execution, just a couple of scary moments, some laughable scenes, a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting, deplorable and depraved scene of violence (fetus scene) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that I've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror.  If that kind of thing appeals to you, this could be right up your alley, but it doesn't do much for me.  I would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension, suspense and a scary story, and you simply do not get that in "Anthropophagus".  To answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie...did "Anthropophagus" bother me? No.  Did I think it was scary?  Certainly not, laughable at some points in the movie but not scary, and nor did I find it disturbing.  However, it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget Italian-made horror flick? Touche!    In my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack, what did I find in "Anthropophagus" but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline.  Indeed, it is very difficult to give this movie any credit.  A word of advice, if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings (like I did with this one), it probably just sucks.  For all intents and purposes, that is the case with "Anthropophagus-The Grim Reaper".  Nevertheless, sadly, I've seen much, much worse. 
 There is a "possible" defect in the M1122 model. I wanted to post my experience here in case others are having this same problem. After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a mildew/urine odor. I don't own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn't suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washer wouldn't get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is featured. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. NB requested the pair be sent to them for testing. If you have experienced this problem with your M1122 (or other models), contact New Balance customer support via their website.   ** With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star, but with regards to the problem above, I would have to give it a zero star. A common ground, I have it two stars but based on the problem I have experienced now in TWO pairs of the exact same shoe 
 Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in "Stairway To Heaven". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!! 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 This is an interesting history.  But it has the same problem common to all books such as this.  Once a name (person) is introduced in the book the reader is expected to remember the name and the relationship of that person to the "hero."  There needs to be a chart or reference to which the reader could easily refer to refresh one's memory when finding the name again, but many pages away from the first encounter 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time.  I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but "Homegrown" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4.   Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent "Who You Fighting For." Now that one is worth the $$$ 
 The "For Dummies" series is way over-done.  The original publisher made a lot of money and has moved on, and maybe so should you.  Like the vast majority of its siblings, Negotiating for Dummies is dry, poorly organized, poorly indexed, and just not funny.  If someone is really a dummy he'd expect a clear step-by-step guide, which this book is not.  .. 
 AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song.  AFI is looking to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if you keep your old sound, which this band has failed to do. This, my friends, is AFI's worst album, if not hte worst album of 2006.  Check out the older AFI stuff. "Sing The Sorrow" is okay, but if you want truley good music, you have to go back into their ninties albums 
 35 bucks for a 3 hour documentary!  Please.  Some good stuff though, esp. when the family talks about the insight to some Hendrix lyrics.  I never heard that before.  It is unauthorized so of course it doesnt have any Hendrix music.  Buy it used, I would have added two stars if they sold it for 20 dollars because it goes into a lot of detail and has some great intervieews and was overall a good production 
 The only star I give this book is for the interesting comments from the collection of chefs presented in the book. Which, by the way, were the only pages printed large enough to read without scrutiny. I have returned this book and cannot recommend it for anyone to purchase without first picking up a copy and opening it. An eagle would need a magnigying glass to read the fine print of every recipe. Using such a tiny font for directions is an unkind joke on those who purchased this book with the intent of actually using it. I wonder if the Food Network "favorites" had an opportunity to see how their work was presented; I doubt even they would purchase such a useless cookbook. 
 "The Passing of The Great Race" was one of the racialist books written between 1855 and 1920 that would strongly influence the the National Socialist Party. The first was Gobineau's "The Inequality of The Human Races", the second was Houston Stewart Chamberlain's "The Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", the third was this one, and the fourth was Lothrop Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy". Grant was a lawyer and conservationist who was a firm beleiver in the Old Order, free of Bolshevism and Socialism and centered around an Anglo-Saxon culture. Grant always tried to portray himself as more scientific than romantic racial theorists such as Chamberlain, but his theories actually have little scientific basis. For example, his division of Whites into Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean Races is anchored only on the basis of Nordic Scnadinavians having blonde hair, Alpine Slavs having brown hair, and Mediterranean Italians having black hair. Even worse is Grant's lack of historical basis. He considers the French, Southern Germans, and Poles to be a mix of Teutonic or Celtic Nordic peoples and dark-haired Alpine peoples who invaded Europe from Asia, but there was never any record of Asiatic peoples reaching France or Germany, at least not after the Celtic period. His classifications of Alpine are also very flimsy. He considers Southern Germans to be of Alpine stock, completely ignoring the fact that Southern Germans speak a Teutonic language and often have Teutonic features such as blonde hair and blue eyes. He also considers the Walloons of Belgium to be Alpine, ignoring the fact that they are descendants of the Celtic Belgae, who the Romans clearly described as being tall with blonde and red hair {sounds Nordic to me}. He also claims that the Irish and Welsh have substantial amounts of Mediterranean blood, ignoring the fact that both those peoples are Celtic and often have blonde or red hair. The most puzziling part of this whole thing is how this book became so popular when practicaly everyone is labled as inferior. Grant considers the only pure Nordics to be people with blonde hair and blue eyes, so why did people like Teddy Roosevelt {brunett} endorse it? Grant's book just lacks any spirit. I've read Chamberlain's "Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", and anyone who is of Celtic, Teutonic, or Slavic stock and is anti-Semitic will be riled up with the romaticism of the "Germanic" race being in constant battle with the Jews for survival. Anyone who has Celtic, Scandinavian, German, Anglo-Saxon, Polish, or Baltic ancestry is included in this Germanic race, while Grant tends to alienate anyone who isn't a blonde, blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon or Swede, even putting the Germans down as inferior. This book should also be compared to Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color", which was written four years later. Stoddard also went by the Nordic-Alpine-Mediterranean model, but focused less on this than on the White Race as a whole. Stoddard was a visionary, looking to White issue in the future. While Grant clamored about keeping non-Nordic Russians and Italians out of the country, Stoddard warned that the real dangers are non-White Asians and Negroes. Grant's book has little relevance to today's issues, as practically every White American is a German-Irish-Polish-Italian mix. Stoddard, however, saw that all Whites had to band together against the "rising tide of color".                      
    This HGW novel is not as satisfying as his more famous  sci fi pieces, but it is representative of turn-of-the-century interest in galactic exploration.  Related in the first person by an impoverished would-be playwright, Mr. Bedford (for whom no first name is given), the story opens as he makes the acquaintance of an eccentric scientist named Cavor in a coastal area of England.  Gradually persuaded by the latter's dreams of conquering gravity by means of a substance he will eventually invent, Bedford soon becomes an enthusiastic convert to theoretical astronomy; he injects some practical ideas-as well as his private dreams of avarice and proprietary empire.  Ah, the temptation of creating one's little sphere of power.       Embarking on an odyssey in a sphere made of Cavorite the partners in adventure land in a crater on the moon, where they encounter odd vegetation which flourishes during the two-week lunar day.  But even more amazing is their discovery of a species of intelligent beings (described by Cavor as ant-men) who dwell in the moon's interior.  When captured the two men fight their way back to the surface, but become separated.  Assuming that Cavor has been killed by the native Selenites (Cavor;s term for them),  Bedford manages to return to Earth, but the story does not quite end there.  What is the source of mysterious transmissions from the moon and--equally curious--what causes them to cease?  Wells' protagonists express the author's commentary on man's propensity for warfare and injudicious zeal to modulate alien civilizations due to our anthropomorphic egocentrism.  Nevertheless, this book offers great sci fi lore which will appeal to kids of all ages!      
 would you buy a used contra from this man?  Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.  Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.  Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.  GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.  Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.  For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.  Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way. 
 Not impressed at all with this product.  You are better off just to plug in your camera in the USB port and let Windows process it.  At least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved.  I suggest you don't use Easyshare software.  Windows Pic and Fax Viewer is far superior to this software.  If you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use Easyshare.  The solution to this is to uninstall Easyshare and all pics with revert to Windows 
 A note of caution to those considering purchasing the Hard Press edition of "A Hero in Our Time."  I bought this edition based on the reviews that mentioned the edition as having been translated by Vlad & Dmitri Nabokov.  So I was surprised when I received the Hard Press edition (soft cover, with grayish-green panels on the top and bottom, and grey and white panels in the center; no picture on the cover, only the text of the title/author).  NOWHERE in the book does it state that it was translated by Nabokov; indeed, the book contains absolutely no translator info whatsoever, leaving the reader completely at sea in determining who translated it (despite Amazon's description that it contains a "Translator's Foreword").  Instead, the book appears more like a manuscript submitted for review, rather than a publication.  There isn't even any Library of Congress or ISBN info anywhere in the book, nor is there a publication date (usually included on one of the opening pages).  "Page 1" is completely blank (other than to say it is "Page 1"); "Page 2" consists of a table of contents, and page 3 launches straight into the author's text (despite page 2's table of contents indicating that the book starts with a "Foreward") 
 Kerber effectively demonstrates the limits of women's roles at the outset of the American Revolution and shows how these roles changed. For instance, Enlightenment thinkers, such as Rousseau, thought that women should be confined to politically passive domestic duties (a view which prevailed at the beginning of the Revolution). Kerber focuses on several women--Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Adams and Mary Wollstonecraft--who exeplified politically active women that defied these 'Enlightenment' views. Though these women were the exception, they influenced other women that it was acceptible to be politically informed and still excell in their domestic duties. According to Kerber, this led to a political transformation of women's roles termed "Republican Motherhood," a concept that encouraged women to be informed politically and use their domestic influence to raise virtuous republican sons, and to politically influence brothers, husbands and fathers. This transformation from politically inactive domestic roles to active, Kerber argues, laid the foundation for the women's rights and abolitionist's movements 
 I installed one of these in my aquarium this weekend and sat back looking forward to lush greenery in my tank.  The system is a sturdy canister in which you mix sugar, yeast, a "stabilizing agent" and water.  These do their thing and the gas comes through a tube down into a bubble track that makes the bubbles zig zag up, exposing them to the water for as long as possible.  Good concept and I'd read pretty good reviews.  But here's the problem.  The track affixes to the wall of your tank with suction cups which create a narrow gap between the tank wall and the track.  I noticed my tetras were getting in there, but since they were getting back out I didn't worry.  Then this morning I found one of the larger females firmly stuck.  I thought she was dead until I released her.  She swam off with an ugly red mark where the thing had caught her.  I hope she's OK.  I removed this death trap from my tank and am seeking safer ways to diffuse the CO2 in my tank.    The canister thing is nice, though, particularly if you're not handy enough to make an airtight seal with a DIY soda bottle system.  It might get another star for that, but seeing how it injured and could've killed one of my fish, I'd like to give it 0.    UPDATE 11/30/06:  After several aquarist friends insisted that I must have improperly installed my diffuser, I tried again, this time making sure the suction cups were squeezed as flat as possible, and one of my friends checked it and assured me that this time there was just not enough space to admit even a small fish.  Two days later, I checked the diffuser and there was an otocinclus trapped behind it.  This one was dead.  Find a better way to feed your plants 
 The habit depicted on the cover of this book is that of a Daughter of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, before 1964.  They do not identify themselves as nuns, since they do not take perpetual vows.  They are "sisters."  What a blunder 
 Bought this micro in Jan., 2006 and by Oct. 2006 was having big time problems. This microwave oven is a fire hazard! The one I bought started arcing, like an arc welder, between the door and the body of the microwave. Sanyo's, "NO Custumer Service", was anything but helpful! Don't buy any Sanyo products since they are junk and they will not stand behind their product 
 I would strongly recommend you to get "The Mahabharata" retold by C.Rajagopalachari. This is the best version of the Mahabhatata you can ever read!!! Please do not buy the version by William buck.. 
 Philosophers should enjoy this one.  The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions.  This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry.  Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter.  From there, the story lost steam 
 But they tried WAY TO HARD to supercede Front Page News and to make it MORE SUCCESSFUL. Failed at both attempts!  This was a big slump period for the band at this point in time.  In fact most of these songs when performed live, HAD the intense fire, these studio versions lacked. 'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker.  This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar.  The live tracks included here (Lorelei) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been', if that energy was put to better use for this project 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 I did not like this craphead book at all. I was not excited to pick it up and could not find myself getting hooked in its non-existant story line. The characters were unrealistic and undeveloped. Is"Kit" a good guy or a bad guy? You just can't root for him throughout the story because he is just an unfinished sketch on a chewed up piece of paper. 
 I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1 
 The book does cover some business relationship basics.  But, it has been covered in many other books and nothing new was received from reading this book.    The book came with a CD.  The CD was poorly made.  Too bad I listened to the CD first.  It gave me a bad first impression and that may have carried over to reading the book.    The book did not keep my attention.  I have three types of books.  There are those that I can't put down.  There are others that I throw away after the first 100 pages. And, there are those that I read a little every day when I am on the stationary bike at the gym.  This was a bike read because I couldn't handle it for too long.  
 I DID NOT order this book and I DID NOT authorize a charge to my credit car 
 This is a terrible album from the first song to the last. The lyrics are obvious and cutesy, appealing only to little girls raised on "Take  your daughter to work days" and "Oprah". She has nothing to  say and says it over the most insipid pop this side of Tori Amos. Will  appeal only to Lilith Fair-fetishists 
 I had previously read Poul Anderson's take on Conan ('Conan the Rebel") and found it irritating - Conan is overdone and overblown in the extreme. To my disappointment, I found that the original Conan has every feature to his character that I disliked magnified by a factor of 10!  But, to be honest, what has turned me off with both books is both authors' use of language - it is as if they both sat with a thesaurus and looked for the macho words to substitute for the regular ones. That's okay for some scenes but for every single action Conan takes? The phrase that made me put the book down was when Conan "laughed gustily". I did too, and then I put this book down and picked up anything else 
 This is something that any first year business student could have written. It is a fast read but it provides no new insights 
 I am a huge Tim Powers fan, but this book was extremely disappointing.    1.  There is no sense of place.  Powers usually makes you enjoy his locations and they become part of the story.  Despite knowing the general location, there is not a single thing interesting about the location.  2. Boring characters.  Some of the Mossad agents are mildly interesting, but the protagonist and the villains are cardboard.  I didn't care about them at all.  I didn't even care who ended up victorious.  3. Bad use of magical background.  Time travel, other dimensions, psychics.  Sounds good right?  The Anubis Gates meets Last Call?  Not even close.  Everything is meagerly developed.  Supposedly the bad guys want to become gods, but the whole thing is discussed in one or two paragraphs.  4. Boring plot. There is no excitement, no sense of dread, no sense of wonder at all.  Overall this book was a total dud compared to his other books.  Good writing as usual, but not much else.  Tim, What happened here? 
 I don't know who else bought this but I can't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get INTO the bed before we turned the thing on...IT FRIED.  Then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when I returned the item.  They did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase.  Always test a product before you risk it on your self or others 
 I was under the impression that there would be meanings for most of the designs.Don't get me wrong, there were some nice designs, but, I was looking for meanings for the symbols and drawings 
 This book is not very informative. I would recomend Zumdohl 6e or something else 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 This review concerns the original 1937 edition as well as the revised 1970 edition, which tells a story completely different from the original.  In the original version, Nancy, Bess and George are going to the coastal town of Seacliff with Mr. Drew who has business there.  Before leaving, Nancy meets a woman who tells her about a statue of a whispering woman which is on the grounds of an abandoned estate near Seacliff.  The woman tells Nancy that Nancy resembles the statue.  Also, on the train to Seacliff, Nancy meets a woman who she fears is going to be swindled by a man she just met on the train.  Nancy tries to help the woman, but she basically tells Nancy to mind her own business.  Nancy being Nancy, decides to try to help the woman anyway.  As well, Nancy gets her stupid dog, Togo, who is a complete nuisance throughout the book.  In the revised edition, Nancy is asked for help from a woman who suspects that she is being swindled by a man she commissioned to sell some rare old books for her.  She believes that the man is only giving her a small fraction of what he is actually getting for the books.  In order to investigate, Nancy, Bess and George travel to Waterford where Nancy uses the alias Debbie Lynbrook and gets a job in the bookstore of the suspected swindler.  There is also a side mystery concerning a stolen whispering statue.  Personally, I didn't find either version very good.  The original edition is the better written of the two (no surprise there), but it didn't have much of a mystery and only the last few chapters were that interesting.  I found the whole Debbie Lynbrook thing in the revised edition rather neat and different, but for whatever reason the mystery never really grabbed my attention in this version.  Neither book is really that bad, but they are not ones that I'd highly recommend 
 4 of "their songs" are covers of S Club 8 & S Club 7 songs, suprising that SC7 & SC8 are all from the same company!! 
 I can say that it is a singular waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy a book of successful essays instea 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 This should be called America in Beer. Smith overrates the importance beer played in the dramatic events of US history. His thesis that beer played an  everyday part in Colonial life is well-taken, if a bit obvious. More  interesting is his history of the brewing industry, and discussion of  historical brewing literature. He should have concentrated on these, and  placed beer and brewing into a context of technological and cultural  change, and ignored political context except as it specifically concerned  alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, Smith's history knowledge rarely  transcends the mundane textbook level -- and even that is outdated, relying  all too often on analyses and interpretations that are decades old, and  have long been superseded. Still, since there is no other book on the  subject, and it is easy, even enjoyable reading (especially the fictional intros to each chapter -- I love those), it is an important work 
 I applaud C.S. Adler's attempt to explore the phenomenon of American-Korean international adoption, but this work of fiction is disturbingly false.  The mother in the story essentially gives her daughter the decision whether or not to adopt Youn Hee, and then the mother praises  the daughter's "generosity."  Even more disturbing is the lack of  a homestudy or social worker to ensure Youn Hee's well-being.  The day  after Youn Hee arrives, her adoptive mother goes to work, leaving Youn  Hee's adoptive sister to look after her.  What ethical adoption agency  could allow this irresponsible, selfish neglect of a newly adopted child?   Also, Youn Hee's mastery of English progresses far too rapidly to be  realistic.  Where is a translator, someone who can help her adjust to a new  language and culture?  I was shocked at this inaccurate portrait of a  terribly handled adoption.  Although the cultural identity issues are  addressed, Adler lacks a basic grasp of the international adoption process  or an authentic understanding of the adoption experience.  The American  girl in this book is an understandable character, but she is given far too  much responsibility and maturity for such a young child.  Please do NOT  read this book if you are looking for insight in the adoption experience.   However, this book serves as an effective testament to just how much work  needs to be done in understanding transracial adoption 
 The introduction pretty well sums up the fatal flaw in this book: "But [this book] isn't a how-to book, it's a what-to book."  You have to ask: How much good is knowing what to do if you don't know how to do it? Go rebuild the engine in your car. I told you what to do; you will have to find out how to do it somewhere else. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else to begin with.  I bought this book to learn how to market my novels. I get: "In this respect [promotion] novelists are luckier than nonfiction writers. Not much is expected from them in the way of promotion.(page 87)" How much less? None? A little bit? Which ones of the 100 "weapons" should I use? Though I forced myself through the rest of the book and its interminably boring lists, I never found the answer.  I will have to say the authors practise what they preach. I would bet they have used all the gorilla (my spelling) weapons in this book, and then some, to sell every copy they can; including, I suspect, many of the glowing reviews on this page from members of their "network." You push my book and I will push yours.  It is a shame that American literature has come down to who is the best marketer. Maybe that is why many new novels, which used to keep me glued to my seat, now get slammed shut after the first few chapters. Maybe the next one will be better.  This book is cotton candy: real yummy but no substance: sugar air. The best part is the money-back guarantee, which the authors proudly proclaim, is a safe bet because most people won't take you up on it.  I have to give it some credit for the appendixes. Of course, you could get the same thing with a few simple internet searches, but I hate to be all negative.  If you buy this book, you may find yourself saying: "I've been guerillaed." 
 So the truth was stated finally by William Dembski in this popular account explaining the origins and principles of "Intelligent Design"; in which he admits that there is  indeed a religious link to what he claims is primarily a scientific hypothesis (But a scientific hypothesis proposed originally by William Paley hundreds of years ago, which was rejected soundly by leading scientists afterwards.). There is nothing in this book which explains how science works, by careful observation and rigorous testing of ideas (hypotheses). Those ideas which are accepted through this rigorous scientific method are either incorporated within longstanding scientific theories, or may themselves be the incipient idea(s) of a new scientific theory which replaces an outmoded one (Most notably, in exactly the same manner that Einstein's Theory of General Relativy and the Theory of Quantum Mechanics replaced Newton's theories of physics, known now as classical mechanics; the latter are now subsumed within the two 20th Century theories forming the core of modern physics.). Dembski clearly doesn't understand how modern science works; he pretends to have such understanding via sloppy logic and intellectually dishonest statements which occur frequently throughout this book.  Intelligent Design is not scientific since it does not adhere to any of the long-established tenets about science itself (Intelligent Design has been judged correctly as the latest flavor of creationism enjoying some popularity amongst fundamentalist Protestant Christians; one notable biologist has referred to it as "reborn creationism".). It can not be tested, simply because it does not generate any testable hypotheses. Moreover, despite claims to the contrary, I have yet to see any peer-reviewed articles testing Intelligent Design; instead, every single book and article published in praise of this idea is merely an attack on the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; this evolutionary theory is itself the central underlying theory for contemporary biology as much as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are for contemporary physics (Any current scientific controversies about the Modern Synthesis are related to understanding the tempo and mode of evolution as seen from the fossil record and the relative importance of random genetic drift as the primary means of causing evolutionary change; they, themselves, do not mean that the Modern Synthesis is in trouble as the successful unifying theory it has been for nearly a century in explaining biological phenomena.). And Intelligent Design is not a new idea at odds with mainstream science, but rather the latest incarnation of an idea dating from the 17th Century regarding a "Great Chain of Being" which was subsequently tested - and rejected - by Enlightenment and later scientists, most notably naturalists, leading up to of course Darwin and Wallace, who almost simultaneously came up with the Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection (The Modern Synthesis Theory is its direct descendant, and includes its principles, as well as evidence from biological sciences as diverse as genetics, molecular biology and developmental biology, which were unknown to both Darwin and Wallace.).   The arguments presented by Dembski are not only intellectually dishonest, but now, irrelevant, as determined by Republican Federal Judge John Jones in his landmark, historic decision for the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial; Jones concluded that intelligent design is a religious doctrine masquerading as science (His decision is posted online at: htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf). Furthermore, thoughtful, reasonable conservatives like Charles Krauthammer and George Will have written lucid, brilliant columns praising the theory of evolution via natural selection, and condemning intelligent design for being an unscientific, religious doctrine.   There are other, more important - and intellectually sound - books available on the so-called "creation vs. evolution" controversy, which I regard as more worthy than any of Dembski's self-serving defenses of Intelligent Design. Philosopher Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" is a splendid historical overview and philosophical deconstruction of creationism, including the best written rebuke of "Intelligent Design" which I've come across (He also covers Dembski's "explanatory filter", and demolishes it too from a philosophical perspective.). Philip Kitcher, another philosopher, published "Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism" back in the early 1980s, but his arguments are still quite valid today. My friend Ken Miller's "Finding Darwin's God" has an eloquent critique of Intelligent Design, focusing on Michael Behe's mousetrap model of irreducible complexity which claims to bestow validity on Intelligent Design. Distinguished American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) invertebrate paleobiologist Niles Eldredge offers yet another brilliant critique of Intelligent Design in his book "Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life", the elegant companion volume to the AMNH Darwin exhibition which he curated, soon to embark on a tour taking it to many of North America's and Great Britain's finest science museums. And last, but not least, Eugenie Scott, Executive Director, National Center for Science Education (www.ncseweb.org), has written a fine textbook on this issue, "Evolution vs. Creationism". All of these books are more desirable than Dembski's "Intelligent Design:The Bridge Between Science & Theology". Otherwise, if you insist on purchasing this book, then perhaps you might choose to acquire instead a splendid text devoted to Klingon cosmology (Neither Klingon cosmology nor "Intelligent Design" can be regarded as scientific, since both depend on faith, not reason, to validate their principles.). 
 How could Rhino do it? The most electrifying bass intro of the 60s is left off the beginning of Tighten Up, one of THE funkiest songs of all time. No opening bass line! Not only that, but the linear notes disses Archie and  the Drells' early albums, loading up on their mid-seventies disco crud.  True, the album has the three big ones - Tighten Up, I Can't Stop Dancin'  and Gonna Be a Showdown. But Tighten Up is the only song from their first  album included on this CD. No I Don't Wanna be a Playboy, A Soldier's  Prayer, Give Me Time, or any of the others. Whoever put this compilation  together for Rhino is NOT an Archie Bell and the Drells fan. The minute I  put the CD on and heard Tighten Up start with the drum roll and not the  bass line, I knew I would be disappointed. Let's hope someday Rhino comes  to its senses and releases whole albums of Archie Bell and the Drells, not  this pathetic compilation 
 I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.  Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was "within specifications" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.  For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.  Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.  The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.  If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.  I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.  To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where "Home" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.  The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.  On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.  In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.  I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road.   On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations.   On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files 
 My wife gave me this book for my birthday this year, and it's the first time I've ever been disappointed by a gift from her.  I read 75 pages of this before I couldn't force myself any further.  The book reads like one long run-on sentence.  Ideas that should have taken a few words to mention are given several paragraphs; those that should have taken a paragraph are given many pages.  An example from early on:  the author spends an inordinate time speaking of how Melkor's tainting of the Music of the Ainur and his eventual exile compares to the Eden story in the Judeo-Christian belief system.  The author states explicitly that she assumes familiarity with the Silmarillion; anyone with such familiarity who was raised by or near Judeo-Christian folk, who also has this presumed knowledge of the Silmarillion, will find this to be obvious and nearly trivial. Instead of being a building block for a larger theme, is in itself given several pages of aimless discussion!  Furthermore, if (besides Silmarillion familiarity) the reader has anything more than a thin overview of knowledge of Greek and Norse myths, then nothing of interest can be learned here.  My guess is that, like me, you'll find that you can rewrite all the useful information contained in the first 75 pages as a single paragraph, not taking even a single page, and conveying the same informational content.  I wouldn't bother 
 First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.   The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.   She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.   Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much "living through others" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.  The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.  Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:  cf.en.cl  In conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution. One could call it propaganda.  - 22yo housewife and part-time science/engineering majo 
 Having Read Mark Bowden's excellent Blackhawk Down, and being quite familiar with small unit action military history, I was anxious for this read.  But editor (and one of the six men whose story is told) Matt Eversmann weighed it down with too much of this sort of nonsense:  "When you get right down to it, I do not think I have ever met a man who did not want to go to war in some way, shape form or another."  "The crew was the best in the world and they proved it every single time the rotors turned." "He was a stand-up guy with a great sense of humor and wit;  there was nothing bad I could say about..." "It is true that battle will turn a boy into a man in seconds.  The sight of these brave men taking the fight right back to the thug militia stirred one of the most poweerful emotions I could ever have imagined.  if I was scared then, watching these warriors..." "the general recited...Shakespeare...never in my life have I heard such inspiring words of comment in the face of overwhelming odds." Then there's the mandatory scriptural quote (I'm always amused by men who join the armed services and then quote scripture).  Please.  Hyperbole. Macho macho.  Rah rah.  Ad nauseum.    Eversmann utterly fails as a writer because he does not bring the REAL emotion of the moment to the reader.  All of his "presence" is at the distance of a writing desk;it's not on the battlefield.  He tells us he breaks down in tears at the end but there's nothing in it.  You'd never know what he was feeling by the descriptions.  There's no intensity in the writing, no fear, no panic, no anxiety, no concern, no nothing except macho pride.   Bowden managed to project for the reader some sense of what the soldiers were experiencing beyond what gun they were firing, and he wasn't even there; he did it all by talking to the men who were and then applying his skill as a writer. The mission was clearly a disaster but one in which men acquitted themselves extremely wellon the field of battle.  Eversmann, by his writing, does not serve the memory of that mission on paper as well as he did on the battlefield.  His mission strikes as a mission of self-glorification and self-justification.    The other men in the book do a considerably better job of it. Generally, writers should tell these stories, not soldiers (note to Matt Eversmann: they'll make you look a lot better).  Readers looking for good unit action are advised to search out Galloway and Moore's We Were Soldiers Once, and Young (Ia Drang in Vietnam)  Both authors were in that battle and it is stunning reading.)  Too much military pep rally, amateur scribbling and ego expression.  Two stars at best 
 Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD.  It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years.  Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next.  One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever.  Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it.  The rest of the CD is throw away.  But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money.  It's the only reason I gave this album two stars!  If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store "Pronto!" 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 A big disappointment after the reviews I had read!Rather shallow in its one-sided fixation on having to have a baby or descriptions of her manicures. Story-line sometimes doesn't add up, e.g., timing of her parents holidays to Italy which was supposed to coincide with her childbirth.But apparently there is a demand for books like that otherwise they would be published. Who needs the Reader's guide at the end? 
 I recently enjoyed hearing Dr Schwartz at a public forum present his experiences leading to this book.  Contrary to his claims, those experiences are nothing like "scientifically rigorous" investigation.  I applaud that "he argues that faith and science are not mutually exclusive", but really, no one could rationally argue otherwise.  I read the "summary" chapter and found several false assertions about math and physics, so I read no more.  It could be that many things Dr Schwartz asserts are true, but it's unfair to science and to faith to assert also that the former supports the latter 
 I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone 
 This tool works well, but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher.  When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon.  Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher.  There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead 
 Although I am sure Cragg has some very interesting things to say, he doesn't know how to say them.  I have read my share of cerebral and professorial books, but Cragg's style leaves *much* to be desired.  His roundabout and cryptic style of writing make for an extremely difficult read.   If you can persist through the maze of words, there is substance here, but it is a daunting read 
 Excerpt from the book, Chapter 2, under the heading "Clergy Characters", page 52:    "A person of homosexual orientation who was living a life of sexual abstinence could make a remarkably good candidate for ministry.  Living as we do in a society that elevates a person's sexual orientation as the supreme mark of humanity, it is countercultural, radical and downright faithful to encounter a person, more disciplined than myself, who is willing to forego worship of Eros in order to serve the church."  I would advise a close study of God's Word before believing the opinions of man 
 I love Branford Marsalis' music. I've been following his stuff for 20 years. When I saw this new DVD a couple months ago, I thought 'what a find'! Unfortunately, it's a bust. It sounds like four guys playing, but none is really listening to any of the others. I'd save my money and pass on this one if I had it to do over 
 This device worked great for a short span of time (a few weeks), then just stopped working.  I returned it to Amazon and received a new replacement.  It worked fine for a while, then stopped working.  It's a great idea, but very weak quality 
 THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE by George Magner haunted me as I read it.  For some time during the reading and after the reading, I experienced discomfort that could not be defined.  My logic persisted.  One might carry persistent logic and troubling thought unconsciously while one drinks a cup of coffee or tea, looks for a four leaf clover, or studies the beauty of the sky.  So suddenly,  A VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE came to my reader's mind full blown and fully defined.  Fully formed was the  problem for which I sought clear definition: this book possesses a basic flaw: it is fallacious.  Simply explained, as each of us knows, if one becomes a VICTIM of another, if another has harmed one with residual infirmities as the author states, there is legal recourse for those victims which brings justice, if harm be proved, to those claimants.  Unless Magner has sued the particular chiropractor and won the case placed before the scrutiny of experts for or against chiropractic, before the tried and true twelve jurors, then he has not proved his case.  If he has won such a case, then I stand corrected.  If not, I find this book trite.   If Magner's case against chiropractic is true, it should be proved to be so under scrutiny not requiring an organization such as he has formed.  There is a fallacy herein that needs to be addressed and judged if one reads THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE, by George Magner.   
 I've read each of John Case's books but this one disappointed me.  It had none of the insightful, suspenseful twists that I have enjoyed in his other books.  And it had no ending, it simply stopped which was to be expected as it really seemed more of a germ of an idea for a story as opposed to being a good story.  I'll read his future books, but I don't recommend this one. 
 Zornberg's book on Genesis had much promise for me, but the book failed to live up to this promise. The author is certainly well versed in the rabbinic commentaries on the Genesis text, but her writing style is so disorganized, and her intellectual leaps so large that following her arguments often take more time than they are worth. If you are searching for a contemporary analysis of the first book of the Bible, I would recommend Dennis Shulman's Genius of Genesis. This latter book was time much better spent 
 It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.   I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect 
 After using the very thorough NG traveler guides for Boston and New York, I found this one to be a disappointment.  Many of the attractions in Hawaii are overrated and not as large in scale as the prospective tourist is lead to believe.  It was also disappointing to find megabuck admission fees at locations where there was no warning in the book.  Of course everywhere you turn around in Hawaii, someone wants to relieve you of your money.  There also appears to be a huge auto theft and theft from auto problem in Hawaii.  Everywhere you turn you are warned not to leave valuables in your car.  National Geographic has and should do better than this guide 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 With all the hype that this book got, I expected much better. As a basic matter, the book does not hold together.  The book cannot figure out if it is a general book about Cohen's strategic leadership theories, or a book about civilian-military relations.  Because Cohen is inconsistent in his aims, the book disappoints.  In the end the reader is left with some disconnected essays that may be individually interesting, but which don't support the overall thesis.  To give one example, while Ben Gurion (one of the four examples the author uses to illustrate his main thesis about civilian control of the military) may have been a great wartime leader, he was not attempting to control a professional military that had inculcated Samuel Huntington's (or Jomini's) theories about military-civilian separation.  The Ben Gurion example just does not fit with Cohen's theory, as interesting as it is to read all about Ben Gurion's terrific library and unusual personality quirks.  I read the paperback edition.  The best material was relegated to the appendices, another sign of poorly-thought-out and poorly edited book.  Cohen admits to having rushed this book into publication, and it's obvious.  He should have called this a collection of essays on leadership, and left it at that. The "grand unifying theory" he attempts to put across fails miserably as technical matter, along with being inconsistently argued 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 This direct to video "sequel" is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler, and another of the countless, and pointless, direct to video sequels to come from Sony/Comlumbia/Tri-Star as of late (Cruel Intentions 2 & 3, Starship Troopers 2, shall I go on?).  Wild Things 2 focuses around a rich girl (Susan Ward) whose stepfather mysteriously dies, and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival (Son of the Beach's hot Leila Arcieri) who claims to be the man's true, biological daughter.  Naturally, just like in the original, there are plot twists aplenty, as learned by an insurance investigator (Isiah Washington, giving a somewhat inspired performance), and naturally, there are double crosses, murders, and a redux of the first film's threesome, only it's not as erotic as the original's.  Wild Things 2 isn't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it's good points, it's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate.  Is it worth seeing?  Depends how much you liked the first Wild Things, but for the rest of us, just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
 the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady 
 This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.  If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.  The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however 
 There is no way to digitally transfer information from the MD Walkman to the computer / CD rom, making this an expensive piece of junk.  A toy not worth the effort.  I am unbelievably disappointed with this product and it's software 
 Many years ago I read "The Things They Carried" by this author which was based on his experiences as an American soldier in Vietnam. That was an award winning book.  Unfortunately, "July, July", which is about a 30-year class reunion in the year 2000 of a group of people who came of age during that period of time, falls flat on its face.   This is an interrelated story of what happened to this these people.  In the book, they are all now in their early fifties, and not one of them has really grown up.  It's a fast read, only 306 small pages, and there are some flashbacks to 1969.  But everyone seems to be have made poor choices and are unhappy with how their lives turned out.  There's a lot of whining as they all come together again.   All of their angst has to do with their romances gone sour.  There's not a word about their philosophy or the economy or technology or any of the vast changes that have occurred during the past 30 years.  And, even in that "lost romance" department, I found myself laughing out loud in places which were supposed to be serious.  I believe that anyone who has lived a full life probably has had some romantic disappointment in his or her background.  However, the people I know don't spend a lifetime wallowing in despair about them and letting such memories ruin the rest of their lives.  That's why this book just didn't ring true for me.   Forget about this book.  The story is weak, there's not a single likable character in the whole bunch, and the narrative is generally annoying.  Good thing it was a fast read and that it held my interest.  Otherwise I wouldn't have read past the first chapter.   
  I actually caught this crapfest on the Sci-Fi channel the other night. That's exactly what it was, a crapfest. I didn't even know I was looking at Nick Carter until I read some of these reviews, which I consider a blessing. No wonder that family has so many problems. And such veteran actors such as Judge Reinhold and Stacy Keach must have been really desperate for cash if they committed to this schlock. And don't even get me started on the headless horseman. He was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy 50's science fiction movie. If you want to see the best version of the story, watch Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. If you want originality, either watch Ichabod and Mr. Toad or read the original story 
 Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author  fails to distinguish between two very different claims:  first, that  boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that  it wasn't talked about much until recently.  The first claim would be  exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second 
 I just paid $1.00 for this book, and overpaid.  The book seems limited to what the author likes to do, not what you may choose to do.   For instance: 1. Kitchner for Stockinette is fully explained, but far from the best I've seen.  For Garter, only the warning that ii is more complicated, and one illustration, but no written instructions.  For Ribbing, just the warning that it's too hard for her. 2. There is no mention of steeks, not even in the glossary.  Even if the book doesn't cover the subject, it should be included in any list of knitting terms. 3.  The original owner of the book had written a question about measuring guage swatches on or off the needles.  After reading the author's section on guage, I'm not surprised.  Her swatching method leaves much to be desired, and in spite of several warnings about measuring not only the swatch but the work in progress several times to be sure the guage stays even throughout the garment, it was not explained that the swatch should be blocked as the finished garment will before being measured. Remember that size 6 sweater that became a 15 when washed and blocked?  If only you'd blocked the swatch first.  THese are just three of the shortcomings I spotted in a quick review.  I doubt I'll even explore the book farther, but at least I didn't pay full price.  All in all, a great disappointment, even at $1.00, and perhaps not deserving of even the one star minimum rating 
 I recently bought 2 Bikini Touch shavers. Both shavers were defective. The warantee is 30 days only - from the day of purchase. My product was delayed in the mail, so by the time I opened the package and found the defective product, 30 days have already passed. The manufacturer had absolutely no interest. So be warned - if the product fails after 30 days, it is tough luck 
 If you purchase this with the intent of sharing your love for the orginal,cherished version of the Nutcracker story or music then do not make the purchase. There is very little of the orginal story line or music in this DVD. In this version, Clara doesn't have parents, is raised by her mean grandfather, and it's her liberated Aunt who gives her the nutcracker. They are chased throughout the story by the wicked rat king...who sends out flying bats to keep them from seeing the Sugar Plum Queen. In the process of searching the nutcracker, Clara, and two others that are on the journey with them...are chased by a huge evil "stone monster" sent out by the rat king. After more non-original activities...the story ends by Clara returning home to meet the nutcracker as a real live boy who she will now be dating.   Buyer be warned! This is NOT the real story line, the dancing is minimized, and the orginal music is all but gone.       
 I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed 
 She starts out slowly to explain the transformation from an individual based responsibility society to one that resolve individual responsibility and blames all woes on the vary society that creates the problem.  A hand full of perverts and commies have taken control of our institutions and perverted the institution's purpose. Sounding like she stumbled upon some great secret and is giving the alarm, this book then quickly turns in to some bitch session that moves from one institution to another. It become very repetitive and offers no solution. She should have stopped when she was ahead.  I haven't heard terms like the deserving and undeserving poor since the re-runs of "My Fair Lady" when Alfred P. Doolittle said "I intend to go on being undeserving".   Maybe it is just that a lot of her descriptions of society are of some place far off or unique and have never made it here. However her descriptions of schools do not match the ones I went to or the local ones that kids are going to today. She must have gone to a different Smithsonian than I did and none of the examples of daily life matches any reality that I have come across.  If the book had a solution section it would be "The Capitalist Manifesto" (a revolutionary plan for a Capitalistic distribution of wealth to preserve our free society) by Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler.  This book is the "Turner Diaries" without the story line. I rate it up there with the best of conspiracy theories. If you make it through this book with out wondering what her problem is then be sure to read "None Dare call it Conspiracy" at least there is an attempt to put some meat behind it.  However the book does describe a good nightmare if you can find it. 
 When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up. This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia.  Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks. Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more.   
 I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work. 
 LIke others who have reviewed the "complete series" I am extremely angry that Sony did not warn potential buyers that the series ended prematurely with no conclusion.  I did not see the original, so had no idea.  This is marketing at its absolute worst 
 My twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. I thought I would buy this book and see if I could have success. The day after I ordered the book, I bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. My son immediately followed suit. Unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so I just had to use some common sense and good instincts. Lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after Easter Break. I offered no rewards other than praise. I did not use a doll. I did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. At the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. I decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. If you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. Just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward 
 This book read like a rocket science instruction manual. A waste of time, and will only leave you more confused 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 The eye-catching cover is as cool and curious as Steve McQueen's turtleneck clad detective in 1968's 'Bullitt' and is hard to resist.  However, unless you're rich and have money to throw away on a  "goof" or want to use the CD as an ultra hip wall hanging or  paperweight then skip it.  A couple of songs are mildly interesting as a  peek inside calypso culture with such lines as "Yankee gone; West  Injun take over now..." and "by the sweat of thy brow thou shall  eat bread" which is leveled at bar girls once the navy clears out of  the town.  The rest is embarrassing, forgetable drivel.  Luckily the  producers included an extra track of Mitchum's cops vs. moonshiner classic,  "Thunder Road" which did not appear on the original album and is  this disc's only saving grace.  My guess is this whole thing was done on a  dare 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!   The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's. Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Touching in parts, but I thought only character that was close to being well done was the little boy/protagonist; others were too sketchy or incomplete, although author tried but just didn't get there. You knew people were in pain, but it was like you could only observe them through a window, not reach out and touch them...Perhaps not my cup of tea. Any 9/11 novel deserves a better effort than this... 
 This is a bland tale with no suspense or unpredictability whatsoever.  It has become obvious with Drizzt books that RAS is only now writing them for money and not for actual content.  and for god's sake, kill somebody already 
  I'm too late as well over 2,000 folks have sent a clear message on this "colossal waste of time" (-- William Shatner, SNL).  In summary...  - Rand cleans something & wanders around - Matt wanders around - Perrin wanders around - Elayne wonders without wandering around - Egwene wonders without wandering around  Once one closes in on the final chapters (if not sooner), one realizes that he/she has been taken by Mr Jordan & company for his/her money with no story in return. 
 Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious "To Die For."  The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.   
 In 1991, Twista came out and got into Guinness, then in 1993 B.O.N.E. released Faces of Death and then the classic EP "Creepin on ah come up" in 1994. I honestly think Twista and other chitown rappers didnt steal Bone's style because even though theyre both fast, bone harmonizes their flow, while twista harshly spits his. This album is a clear cut example of how Three 6 Mafia used Bone's style to come up. This album was originally released in 1995 and each of the members of the group sound almost identical to the Bone members. If you want my opinion, Three 6 used Bone's style to come up in the business and that is evidenced through the fact that in Three 6 today. "Stay Fly" and "Poppin My Collar" sound nothing like "Live By Yo Rep", all being good songs. Look at that to comparison with Bone ,, "East 1999" and "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" sound very similar to Bone's appearances in "Ridin", "Spit Yo Game", "Dont Forget About Us", and their solo work 
 Seriously, the book is beautifully photographed and the rooms are very well designed if you like rooms where no one actually has to LIVE...  I think from an purists' point of view, this is a great study of design but if you are looking for a book to give you actual, usable ideas for re-designing your condo space - get a different book. I regret buying it as I was looking for more than a visually stunning coffee table book (which it definitely qualifies as). I was looking for realistic design ideas.  Each of the spaces looks like no one has or ever COULD live in them.  But, if you have tons of money and no personal possessions, this might give you some useable ideas 
 Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers.  I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times.  At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com.  First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful.  Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog.  It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?  
 terrible film-DVD transfers, and yes, you get 50 movies for about $13, but look at the titles carefully.  if you feel you can enjoy at least 2 of the movies, then this set is worth it (for me it was being able to watch "Horror Express" and "Bad Taste" for the 1st time in decades).  otherwise - WOW!  there's a lot of crappy movies in the box 
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 If you like nice pictures of hotels, buy it. If you want to know more about 'hotel design', buy something else 
 First the good news.  This is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles.  It easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan.  But for the bad news I would give this skillet four or five stars.  The bad news is that someone at the Anolon plant damaged the pan BEFORE it was placed in the Anolon carton.  Neither the Anolon box nor the outer UPS shipping carton showed any damage when I received the skillet.  It wasn't until the the following day, after I threw out the packaging, that I noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly.  True, I should have been more attentive when I received the pan,  but I never suspected Anolon would package damaged goods.  I'll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by Anolon again!  
 I'm afraid that this book is so appalling that I just had to add my voice to the chorus of disapproval for it.  I have read many, many texts on this period and this is far and away the worst I have ever encountered.  The text and style are simplistic - almost in the style of a "Children's book of the Middle Ages".  The arguements and assertions are so sweeping and general as to be next to useless, and are made with no reference to geographical differences (of which there were myriad).  Much of the work moves from the period 1100 to 1600 and not the period he initially states that he is covering.  Finally, the book is riddled with historical inaccuracies from errors on heraldry, to errors on dates (he doesn't even get his dates on the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem right), to errors on armor.  Indeed, his lack of knowledge on armor and the timing of innovations and trends would be laughable if I hadn't actually paid for this book.  This book has no redeeming features at all, and can only be considered a waste of precious trees. If it were possible, I wouldn't even have given it one star.  There are far superior works on this period to be had.  While most are quite academic, if you want a broad sweep of the middle ages that is easy to read and accessible to the lay person, then try "Terry Jones' Medieval Lives".  You'll learn a lot more about the period (as it relates to Britain!!) and have a smile too 
 ...Allow me to warn you:  these recordings have been idiotically overlain with phony crowd noise.  The ultimate sacrilege:  an arhythmic clap-along all the way through "Secret Agent Man"!!!  (Some of the clowns are on the beat, some a beat off; most follow a different drummer.)   Handling it with tongs, at arm's length, clothes pin clamped over my nose, I immediately took it down to Everyday Music, hoping either to sell it or bury it.     
 First of all this is a review that will help adults and young adults out the most, because younger kids who like horrors frequently enjoy horrors such as this one or the Grudge or the Ring. Now to the older people, this movie sucks it is one of the worst horrors I have ever seen. So I love horrors and I have seen a lot including the pg13 ones such as the Grudge and the Ring. Those two were descent back in the day but when comparing Pulse to them they look like the scariest movies ever. I have to admit there was only one scary part in this movie, but I wont give it away. It was also really annoying that the whole movie was in a blue tint so it was hard to get past that. And if you think that just because it is unrated that there will be blood and gore and extreme violence, YOURE WRONG. For those who love gorefest movies this isnt it, I know the front cover kind of looks that way but it isnt. I dont recall one scene of blood, the enemy was a virus through a computer and the acting was horrible. There was also the brilliant idea to add some humor into this movie, they said that this virus could get through any thing electronic so they covered everything in red duct tape to keep them from getting through, HAHAHAHHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I beg who ever is reading this to not even rent this movie, it sucks, I made the worst mistake by buying this movi 
 This is Hemingway's worst book.  It's hard to know if he was going for the "titillation factor" or if he was simply this jaded, cynical and without compassion.  If "three ways" thrill you, this is your Hemingway book; otherwise, it simply illustrates how superficial and careless he could be -- and his writing in this one is pitiful 
 I never received the purchased items. I've sent you an email regarding this "loss". You did not answer my email with complaint 
 She took all of this from other authors. Even her section of how to eat chocolate is strangely reminisant of Will Clower's (The Fat Fallacy) Chocolate Eating Lessons concept.  She makes umpteen references to the French and how they eat -- which I am sure she got from French Women Don't Get Fat.  She isn't sure which book she is writing - her Wear More Cashmere book or this one. This book has a few too many references to the Cashmere book not to feel like an advertisement for it. The exercise portion isn't very practical -- unless you have a pool, a dance partner, fencing studio or horse stabled nearby. She talks about her old money upbringing enough to be tiresome...and so you just know that she has never had to try to fit exercise around a full time job.        She has some good ideas but unfortunaltey they are someone else's. 
 First of all, I like to congratulate all the readers that read this book more than once.  That is quite a feat. ONE time is more than enough.  This book is so boring for a fictional read.  It reminded me of the movie, "Solaris", which is about going back in time only it added another twist: if you could change the past, would you?  Anyway, that movie is just as boring, but I must say it is better than this book because the actress is hot.  I thought the author's concept of "One" is quite confusing.  For instance, the chapter when Leslie encourages her younger self to pursue playing the piano, a path she had not taken, this will affect her life and what she is now.  In any case, I don't think one decision can totally change a whole person's life as some readers suggest.  If this was the case, we would all be in deep trouble.  There are always exceptions, such as deciding to buy that lottery ticket and winning, but usually it takes many decisions to shape one's life.  I don't buy this decision-making plot or the plot that everything is "One".  But two stars for the nice self-help pieces littered throughout the book and for the nice cover 
 Sorry Leslie - I used to enjoy your movies (Naked Gun series and Airplane especially), but this movie was horrible.  I kept watching it, in the expectation that it had to get better (funnier) at some point.  It never did.  You robbed me of 90 minutes of my life 
 When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development. The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky. Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars 
 Will we suffer from Guruitis?  More guru crap from Wayne Dyer. This guy's right to space expired with Timothy Leary's in the sixties. Here he is involved in so many contradictions and idiocies it is amazing he doesn't make himself laugh.  He rails against ego and then shows his own humongous ego with no recognition of the contradiction. This book is a tribute to Wayne by Wayne for Wayne and all about Wayne. He actually thinks he is the reincarnation of Saint Francis of all things. Hilarious. 							 His ideas, as always, are a rehash of every other Guru . Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Ram Das, Deepak Chopra, Da Free John, Werner Erhard, Thich Nhat Hanh, Sai Baba, Krishnamurti, Osho, Swami Sivananda and late comers like Andrew Cohen all trying to get some room at the guru trough. I think there is only one book and they all copy from it a with few twists to try for authenticity.  All the same and sooooooo booooring and repetitive.  Let go of ego, seek spirituality, I am God, Ommm  send me money, buy my book.  And yet there are the hungry that eat up each warmed over meal.  Unreal  
 Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities 
 If you know anything about writing some HTML, and setting up a site, you know more than this book has to offer. Very vague, very outdated, and really all fluff. Save your money 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 I saw this cute photo and bought it for my girlfriend. when i got it, it was the most horrible one 
 Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:  1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.  2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.   New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD 
 Three times I picked up this book and started it. Three times I put it down and read something else instead. Since I let myself run out of reading material I picked this up again. It is truly one of the worst Iris Johansen books ever written. As the previous reviewer said "It's far fetched and a lot of drivel." After reading the first hundred pages or so I finally flipped to the last chapter and read through that, skipping entire paragraphs. This is really a no brainer, no suspense, most repetitive book I have ever tried to read. I give it a MINUS 5 star rating. I have purchased my last Iris Johansen novel. Save your money. Buy Stuart Woods, James Patterson or Lisa Gardener. 
 FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back 
 Wow.  This movie sucked the big one.  But before we get into the gritty details, a quick plot summary.  Daniel Berndhart, a washed out bum of an actor, stars as a mildly retarded former fighting champion scouring the strees of America (which look mysteriously Russian) for an escaped prisoner, Shrek.  Danny ends up in jail himself as an undercover agent, who then is launched into a plotless chase after a crime syndicate.  I couldn't tell you any more if I wanted to, there is no story!      This hunk of sweaty turd ruined two hours of my life.  This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen crawl out of a toilet and onto my TV screen.  It is simply horrible.      To begin with, the plot seems to develop naturally for the first ten minutes, until Daniel Berndhart decides to shoot two of his fellow policemen for no apparent reason.  Quickly followed by a demented scene involving a riduculous closeup on the face of a chubby courtmaster, I suddenly knew how terribly low budget this Russian horror flick was going to progress.      The director's idea of a special effect was zooming in way to close for comfort on the actors and making nasty noises.  For example, after the prison warden speaks with a crime boss, his nervousness is expressed through fogging up the camera lens with his panting gasps.  Besides just special effects, the horrendously low budget showed itself through the fact that every scene occured in one building that looked strikingly familiar to the Kremlin.  The police station, prision office, and gangster's hideout, all have short clips showing the aforementioned before cutting to the action.      Now to the actors themselves.  The only redeeming quality of this cast is the coincendence that one of them looked exactly like Benjamin Franklin (the gangster).  However, he had some distinctly un-colonial personality traits, such as his fetish for positioning 20 scantily clad women around his throne, all of whom seemed to serve no purpouse beyond decoration.     Lets move on to the unique wardrobe feautured in the film.  Costumes ranged from victorian era dress suits to 1920s striped jail uniforms to industrial era clothing reminiscent of Oliver Twist.  As a bonus, the prison guards dressed like members of the Gestappo and travelled in packs to boot.  Most suprising of all is the fight uniform of one of the "kumite" (which never really happens) participants, a speedo swim suit.      Before closing, I would like to point out how random and worthless the majority of the scenes were.  There are to many to include, but my personal favorite was when two gypsies performed before Ben Franklin for 5 minutes, adding nothing to the plot but more senslessness. This makes "Jaws III" look like a classic.  Simply stated, I cant evin express the pain watching this movie put me through, I would rather gouge out my eyes with a rusty grapefruit spoon than watch it again.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! UGH... 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I purchased the first Symphony of Enchanted Lands along with Unholy Warcry. I liked them enough that I decided to get what was at the time Rhapsody's latest offering. I knew full well what I was getting into: cheesy dialogue, over-the-top vocals, and fast guiter wankery.  Well, when I was able to give this album a listen, I was disappointed.  My main gripe with SoEL II is the amount of dialogue, which I guess isn't so bad, but I grew bored of it by my third listen to the album. I ended up ripping each track and creating my own CD with select songs from this album.  The music itself is enjoyable, especially if you're already a fan of Rhapsody. However, this album was just not to my liking 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 -This spectacular piece of poop is about the three angels stopping a former angel from taking over the world or whatever. So the angels must stop her and whiles they're busy doing that they run into such amazing adventures like stripping for no reason and delivering lines so terrible they almost blew out my center speaker. In the incredibly predictable and crappy end they save the day and they all give us a constipated smile to suggest that they live happily ever after. Wow that has never been done before. I always thought that foolscreen DVD's were the worst thing to happen to cinema but it turns out I was wrong, that crown goes to the master filmmaker McG. How the hell he keeps getting his movies green lit is perhaps the greatest mystery since "why Paris Hilton is famous". I'm really glad that he dropped out of the new "Superman" movie and let the supremely talented Bryan Singer direct, because if he had directed it then "Batman Begins" would have been the first and only great DC comics movie.  -I really hate this movie. Usually there's something decent about every movie but this movie had NOTHING. Much like that dog poop "House of the Dead" this movie is devout of any form of entertainment what so ever. There are potholes so big you can drive a tank through them. Then there's the lines, my god this movie has pound for pound some of the worst dialog ever to invade my ears. Whoever was the DP on this movie needs to beaten severely because the look of this crap gave me a headache. The colors are so bright and so "look at me" that it causes nausea, and the lights are so heavy on the actors that their faces look like it has had too much make up applied to it.   -The fights are also incredibly stupid. You can tell that these women are on a wire so much that it borders on the idiotic. McG's attitude in this crap was that the angles can do anything, and that includes sliding under tables and doing cartwheels with a chair. Another thing that drove me insane is that these girls are suppose to be intelligent and yet they keep acting stupid in every scene that we see them in. There is one scene in which the angels must retrieve a key from a man and instead of waiting for him in a parking lot and knocking him down to steal the key, they instead opt to do a striptease and distract him. I'm sure some horny 14 year old may find that entertaining but if you're not horny, and 14 then you'll find it as pointless as everyone else did. The music is bland and the jokes go down faster than Jenna Jameson at work. If you look up deplorable in the dictionary you'll see a picture of this movie  -If you have a party and you want to clear out the room then pop this movie in and surely everyone will leave your house so you can clean up, but if you're not having a party and want to clear the room then please by all means avoid this with all your might. it is really dreadful and painful, kinda like my jokes 
 This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section.   I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either 
 How is it that Klute transitioned from making the most amazingly oppressive Industrial noise to making easy listening Drum 'n' Bass?  If you want aggressive dnb buy Friction, Kemal, Dylan, Twisted Individual, Dillinja, Black Sun Empire, Ed Rush, Usual Suspects, Stakka, Trace, Keaton, Hive, or even Dieselboy 
 The Gutter and the Grave is a re-issue of an early McBain who had not quite hit the stride that makes him an immortal of the genre. Clearly dated (even given the fact that it was written in 1958) the dialogue lacks authenticity (a hard boiled detective lieutenant dismissing an obviously phony alibi as horse "manure"), and the realism of the 87th Precinct novels is clearly lacking. The overnight decent of the hero from succesful private eye to Bowery bum because of his wife's infidelity is a bit over the top as is machinations of the other characters. The prime suspect is jailed in minutes of the first murder and sits there  througout the novel's other murders( all committed by the same gun)  without seeking legal counsel ,the alcoholic hero who is always in full control of his faculties and apprently has not lost any his athleticism  nor his allure to every woman he meets in the novel taxes credulity. .  If "Gutter" is to be the last McBain, it was not a grand exit. I hope there is an 87th Precinct lurking somewhere.        
 ... for those with any intelligence what so ever a pointless read.  Vincent points out all of the obvious connections to Kings other works.   There was no interview with the author to speak of... There was no new insight into the characters or about the worlds.  Disappointing through and through 
 Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one 
 As some other reviewers here have noted, this book seems to have been written by people who don't actually like Japan, Japanese people, Japanese culture, or pretty much anything Japanese at all. As such, they spend too much of the book showing how they are so superior to everything Japan has to offer. If you follow this book, you will end up missing so much of what this fabulous (albeit, at times difficult) country has to offer. Well, OK, this book does have some useful information. But, you will be best off with just about any other guide book 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 Pro's  It's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.  Con's  No compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry. I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon. The zipper "teeths" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop.    
 It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society. It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety.  The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in. Drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective 
 wow. i've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.He's done alot of great work... but damn this cd ain't even catchy one bit.  you can hear the pitch fixer on benji's voice throughout the entire cd... it's bad. like realllllly bad. and it's way over produced.. 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 The Big Book of A.A. defines Alcoholism as having an "insanity" component, with "strange mental blank spots", an "appalling lack of proportion to the consequences", and so forth. Unless you have this problem, you may be a "certain type of hard drinker", but you are *not* an alcoholic according to A.A. Trimpey seems unaware of the insanity component with real alcoholics. Will power isn't enough.  His book will probably be of little value if you are one the real alcoholics defined by the Big Book of A.A. Instead of Trimpey's book, I highly recommend the book Willpower's Not Enough by Arnold M. Washton 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA

 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 A shining star in the quest for the most incomplete work ever published by credible institutions, David Griffiths triumphs over both the competition and his other works with his widely-distributed Third Edition of Introduction to Electrodynamics.  The useful life of this book is 6 months, as that is how long it takes physics students to complete the intermediate level sequence on electricity and magnetism. Because most of the meaningful content of this book that would make it (at least) more complete gets reproduced by teachers in classroom lectures, both graduate students and undergraduate students must redo homework problems, never again to know if their answer is correct, in reassurance that they still know the concepts that they were taught months or years ago. Even the few sections of the book with worded analysis instead of mathematical analysis depend so strongly on the mathematics once again that without a complete word-based definition and explanation, no student can sit down with the book for any less than 30 minutes at a time to identify and restudy key concepts. In fact, the only chance that students have of cutting out 29 of those 30 minutes is by looking at the formulas in the front and back covers of the book, many (particularly those in the back) of which students should already have memorized from completing the sequence. If only Griffiths would add "By looking in the back of the book" before spitting out "Easy" or "Obviously" every few sections, students would not be so nearly put down by such a travesty of a science textbook.  The impossibility for students to learn from the hundreds of missing steps in derivations throughout the book (which you get to see in their entirety for the price of your tuition), the lack of page references or useful word-based explanations of terms, and Griffith's "obvious" attitude problem serve to make Introduction to Electrodynamics the worst book ever 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 I Look for books all the time on this topic to see if there any new moves I can pick up to help shape and tone the stomach area which is a problem for most of us. I think if you are just starting out this book will help you understand the positions you need to get into but it's going to take alot more than 8 minutes to get results and I have been training for years 
 I've been to Italy several times.....Rome, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Milan, some of the hill towns, etc.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 But this for my kids and it was the most boring movie I have ever watched. The shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie 
 First, I must say there are lots of useful gems in this book, but one major problem really torpedoes it.  I'm going to TRY not to make this review a "why this book didn't help ME in particular" review, but I think the book's problem is a serious one.  It's written for people who, given their background, should already have no problems getting into a top school.  This is extremely evident in the example essays.  The applicant-authors of these example essays should be shoe-ins for acceptance at top schools.  Most are already established, successful managers and consultants with few serious weaknesses.  The rest have something interesting or extraordinary in their backgrounds that obviously set them apart from the pack.  I mean, seriously:  Does an international IT consultant with a great resume and a 3.9 GPA really need this book?  The author of this book would have earned more stars from me had he shown how someone with multiple serious deficiencies turned his application around and succeeded despite his background.  He could have shown a boring, mediocre white male applicant whose essays made him or her stand out.  I would think that most of the people who are looking for help getting in to school fall into these categories 
 I feel like I must have missed the boat based on other reviews. I thought the plot was cheesy and a lot of the action plain ridiculous,simplistic and unrealistic. The scenes where Dr. Brockton is abducted and he doesn't report it or treat it like a crime along with scenes with the Cooke county sheriff are so unrealistic I was quite surprised. This sort of lawless Eastern Tennessee genre did not work for me. This book seemed very cliche and unoriginal. Very dissappointing 
 Maybe I'm too cynical because I never got to work for the successful, whiz-kid companies; Maybe this book wasn't written for me!  This book reminds me of Jacobsen's "Use Cases" book of the 1990s. 'Use Cases' was all the rage but after several years, we slowly learned the truth: Uses Cases does not deal with the architecture - a necessary and good foundation for any piece of software. Similarly, this book seems to be spotlighting Testing and taking it to extremes.  'the test plan is the design doc'  Not True. The design doc encapsulates wisdom and insight a picture that accurately describes the interactions of the lower level software components is worth a thousand lines of code-reading.  Also present is an evangelistic fervor that reminds me of the rah-rah eighties' bestseller, "In Search Of Excellence" by Peters and Waterman. (Many people have since noted that most of the spotlighted companies of that book are bankrupt twenty five years later).  - in a room full of people with a bully supervisor (as I experienced in my last job at a major telco) innovation or good work is largely absent.  - deploy daily - are you kidding? to run through the hundreds of test cases in a large application takes several hours if not days. Not all testing can be automated.  - I have found the principle of "baby steps", one of the principles in the book, most useful in my career - it is the basis for prototyping iteratively. However I heard it described in 1997 at a pep talk at MCI that the VP of our department gave to us. So I dont know who stole it from whom!  Lastly, I noted that the term 'XP' was used throughout the book, and the back cover has a blurb from an M$ architect. Was it simply coincidence that Windows shares the same name for its XP release? I wondered if M$ had sponsored part of the book as good advertising for Windows XP! :) 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 Being a lab owner, I bought this book as a gift for another lab owner, and was quite disappointed when I received it.  It's still a cute book, but I  didn't find it to be nearly as funny as I thought it would be 
 This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game.  I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone.  It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it 
 For optimal being. one must overcome greed, illusions, and hate, and one must strive to achieve love and compassion.  Sounds interesting but unfortunately this one sentence is virtually all Fromm has to say on the subject.  After stating this, he then warns the reader that he has no intention of discussing the matter any further.  Instead the book is comprised of a series of random thoughts, all very brief, that are only marginally related to the art of being.  When he does elaborate, he merely goes off on a tangent with a quote from Freud or a reference to Marx (his gods).  I found this all rather loathsome.  I can only conclude that people who enjoy reading this drivel must be psychology majors.   This is one of the few books that I threw into the garbage upon reading it.  
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant 
 I waited for 4 weeks and never got the book, i tried to contact the vendor 3 different times with no response. I purchased the book somewhere else and I got it the next day. I am still waiting for my money to be returned 
 Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool.  If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book. 
 I had to buy this book for a philosophy class. I do not like this book. I think that for an lower level philosophy course, there is not enough explaination from the author 
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written.  Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos 
 This assessment is based on a small amount of Polish Professors and their evaluations and judgments. After reading these opinions we come to the resolution that the exhumation was not allowed and suspended; therefore, only through this missing fact history can be explained and supported, unlike this book presents. This book mostly is used to darken the Pole image and put blame on them and not the real culprits - the Germans. One of these reviewing Professors is Jerzy Robert Nowak. The included links provide more information on this and other issues.   http://www.jerzyrobertnowak.com/ http://www.pogonowski.com/display_pl.php?textid=120 http://www.pogonowski.com/display_pl.php?textid=140 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 Unfortunately, I had to trawl through a good number of his 'books' for a school project. Among them are House of Cards, Diagram Diaries, Barefoot on White-Hot Walls, Giuseppe Terragni, and Eisenman Insideout. They are all terribly self-involved with his semiotic and 'metaphysics' babble. It is only by beholding the vast amount of twaddle he has generated, that I am convinced he truly believes in all this. Despite the painful reading sessions, I think we should simply lie back and feel sorry for him 
 This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very "hush-hush" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.  The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.  That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive "honey pot".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.  Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive "raw" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game "Go Fish".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.  Grade: * out of **** 
 By the time I came to this movie, I had already gotten there first three. Up in Smoke was fantastic, Next Movie was great, Nice Dreams was good, this was was pretty poor. They get pretty desparate at some points here, and they constantly repeat chracters we've seen already. The Low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals (badly), the astronaut which is Cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space, and then pretentds to jerk off at the end. Also, when they got to "Harry Palms" masterbating Champion, that was about as low and unfunny as you could get, just awful. All the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long, including the fake nightclub. The people laughing at Cheech doing a redneck, had to have been payed actors. There are some good points... not that many though. Maybe the wrestling scene, and some of the scene with Chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room. They don't seem to do much in this. I wanted something different, which is what I got, but I didn't think it would be this horrible. These guys can do better. 
 Not particularly well written right-to-life Christian propaganda, disguised as a novel. I picked this up on a whim - what a mistake. 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.  I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  "Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.  If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?&quot 
 I despise this album. I know that's enough to give all you indie/Punk/Post-Punk elitists all the more reason to buy this album and pretend you like it, so proceed to buy your tasteless little hearts out. But this fact remains: Second Edition is a waste of money. The semi spoken-word song called "The Suit" is interesting and worth hearing just for Lydon's rare, non-shrieking monotone, but screw the rest of the album. I prefer Lydon's melodious wailing from PiL circa 1983-1992. His solo dance album is tops as well (Psycho's Path, I believe). What else can I say; I'm happy with his lovely pop-infused work. I suppose I'm easy to please (unlike all you embittered pricks pretending to like something like Second Edition that Lydon purposely made to be unlistenable)  
 I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one.  That is my favorite flavor.  The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste, so I will not buy this flavor again.  The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent.  I will be trying other flavors in future, just not this one 
 I admire Cicero and and I like THE NATURE OF THE GODS, but I give it 2 stars because of the poor translation, which renders a lucid book intolerably boring. So, please throw away the PENGUIN edition and check out the same title by OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSCIS translated by P.G.Walsh. After you have compared the two editions, you will realize the weakness of J.M.Ross' translation 
 I bought this book as well as the ARCO Master the Treasury Enforcement Agent Exam.  The LearningExpress book oversimplified the questions.  Having read it first, I thought the test was going to be very easy to pass, especially since I hadn't done that kind of math in about 8 years.  Once I looked at the ARCO book, I realized it wouldn't be such a cakewalk.  The ARCO book helped me pass the test.  Had I simply gone off the LearningExpress book, I would have failed the math portion, no questions about it.  I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone trying to get ready for the TEA exam 
 This book as badly organized and basically useless.  One of the worst books in the field 
 The author's introduction goes into detail about the orgin and definition of the word 'Robot' and how it applies to this 'Showbot' project. However, the machine outlined in this book is not a robot in that it has no onboard sensing or decision circuitry at all. It is a remote controlled roving person shaped device complete with vacuum cleaner and beverage dispenser. If that's what your looking for this is a great book, but if you want to learn about robots capable of autonomous actions, look around some more - I recommend 'Programming Robot Controllers' or 'Building Robot Drive Trains' both from the Robot DNA series or even 'Robot Building for Beginners' as a better starting point 
 	Junie B. Jones goes to first grade at last!  If you liked Junie B. Jones in Kindergarten, you'll love her in first grade. I know I did! I like Junie B. because she's a trouble maker. She always has an excuse for everything. She goes on little adventures which hardly work out well. If you like trouble, go to your local library and get Junie B. Jones Goes to First Grade at Last 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine 
   Look, let me say from the top I am not one of those bible-thumpers with a persecution complex (like my friend down below here who's ascribed Harris to hell... please don't think I'm like him.)  I did not take a secular class on biblical literature to have my beliefs confirmed.  I specifically took it because I wanted to hear secular viewpoints and glean knowledge and interpretations that I might not find at a biased church bible study group.  I fully expect - and *want* - college classes on religion to be secular, unemotional, scientific, and non-evangelical.  I can go to church to get religious teaching; I can go to school to learn about history and literature.   That said, this book... not so hot.  Not because my God is disrespected, but because Harris is not scientific enough.  Often times when he states an opinion, even when it has positively zero facts, evidence, or even hints supporting it, he states it as an absolute actuality rather than as a possibility.  Often times he just gets things dead wrong.  Here's a little example, although there are many: in the chapter on the book of Esther, he says that "Mordecai... manuevers events so that his beautiful cousin Esther, whom he has adopted (Esther 2:7) becomes queen."  There is nil even suggesting that Mordecai did so in the text.  Go read the book of Esther, it'll only take you a half hour; you'll find nothing to that effect.  Harris doesn't present this as a possibility, he presents it as a fact, and doesn't even bother to support the statement.  We're just supposed to buy whatever he says.   In a similar vein, he rarely considers multiple viewpoints.  Sticking with the Esther chapter (for sake of continuity) he proclaims Esther as a "patriotic fiction."  He sites the fact that two main characters, the queens Vashti and Esther, are not listed in any other documentation besides this book, so therefore they must not exist.  Never does he mention that the Hebrew word for "queen" might also translate "head wife", a status among swarms of other wives that did not mean either of these women were co-rulers and therefore would have any special place in the annals of Persian history (and besides, who says we've *found* all the annals of Persian history?  It's been thousands of years!  Isn't it reasonable to assume that a couple of books went missing?)  He says that one of the main characters, Mordecai, is said to have been deported to Persia from Babylon -- except, he says, the exile was at least a hundred years previous, making Mordecai and Esther too old to be alive at this point.  Again, he ignores the wording in Esther 2:6 in which Mordecai is said to have been carried away into exile... his ancestors are simultaneously listed in the same breath, making it unclear who the verb for "had been carried away" is being applied to-- Mordecai or his ancestors.  Thus, it's possible (note I am not so narcissistic as to present *my* opinion as fact) Mordecai is actually presented as a close ancestor to those who have been carried away.     I could go on.  The point is, Harris does this a lot.  He takes only one historical perspective when other perfectly intelligent, viable, and even secular but less negative viewpoints are easily available if he only bothered to search a little deeper... or even just read the text.  I don't expect him to list all of the many, many interpretations and possibilities; of course this would make the text far too expansive.  But I think it's reasonable to expect him to do his homework and offer up at least a some variation in his persepctives considering this is a textbook for a college course.  Try to be a little more even-handed when you write another one, Harris 
 I hated this book.  It is, from cover-to-cover, chock-full of cliches.  The faithful black family retainers; the silly, southern belle best friends; the wacky mother (Lavinia);the conflicted main character (Caroline).   I also found the book a little anti-semitic in that the most vile character in the book is Caroline's Jewish husband who tells her he will come to see her mother "after she's dead".  Caroline's brother, who treats his wife and children like second class citizens, however, is given all sorts of excuses for his behavior and given a pass on an affair, all the while Caroline is criticizing her husband for his sexual proclivities.  Ridiculous.  I thought Lavinia's illness was a cheap shot plot point to garner the reader's sympathy.  I just kept wishing for Lavinia to die already.  I also found that "yanh" southern dialect for "hear" EXTREMELY annoying, as it was on every other page.  It is mystifying to me that so many people gave this book 4 and 5 stars.  Evidently a great number of people have never read good literatur 
 Well, I know I'm in the minority here.  But a real history of the connection between music and race in America is something that it desperately needed.  One might expect an academic historian to have provided that.  But this book is NOT a good history - it's highly impressionistic and rather anecdotal and full of ideas that aren't exactly explained.  It jumps around from chapter to chapter making much of the impressions that the author has about the 'hidden' messages within songs, but I'm afraid that he states rather than argues or proves his case.  I hope someone out there DOES write the book that's needed.  In the meantime this one is interesting if the style doesn't bother you too much.  
 The odering process was easy and came in a timely fashion.  I am very satisfie 
 I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.  The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.  It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.   I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.   Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated 
 does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
 I have spent from $20-$100 on waterproof headphones over the last 2 years and I can say, without hesitation, these are the Absolute Worst of the bunch.  Before I discuss this brand, I would like to say, if you are a swimmer and buy waterproof headphones, they are going to short out so be ready to buy new ones every few months. That having been said, let's talk about the H2O brand.   The first thing that I could not understand about these headphone is why a bungy cord behind the neck would be so short.  There is no way for any normal person to use these comfortably.  Once they are in your ears, you are not able to comfortably rotate your head without pulling at least one of the ear pieces out of your ear.  To solve the problem, I just removed the head piece so that I would just have the ear pieces and could stick them in my ears and swim away.  Well, that was not possible because the ear pieces continuously slipped out of my ears.  I even changed the ear piece covers to some that I had used in the past. The ear pieces still slipped out of my ears. I spent more time fiddling with this garbage than I did swimming.    Let me just sum this up by saying, this is the only pair of waterproof headphones that I have thrown away that still worked. These are the worst headphones ever.  Opt for the $20 brand, they work just fine after you cut the tips off and replace them with your own!  
 I was so annoyed by this book, I wanted to send it back.   First, it contains maybe 20 pages of real info, padded out to 450 pages. They do this by putting each day on a separate page, with a two- or three-paragraph "prediction" for each day. They try to fill the rest of each page with typographical devices, an affirmation, etc.   Second, the info that's there is mostly happy talk, platitudes, and exclamation points. They have a "prediction" for every day, even though some days just aren't all that astrologically significant.    I also ordered Levine and Jawer's book, and it's fine. They break it down by sign and give no-nonsense predictions for each month's key days on a two-page spread. They also give an overview of each year and month, by sign 
 I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn... 
 OK, so the Intelligent Design thing didn't pan out.  It had a pretty good run in the press, and even the President got behind it.  But in the end, no peer-reviewed papers were published, no experiments were done, no testable hypotheses were advanced.  It was rejected by scientists, and eventually dismissed angrily by a conservative judge on the grounds that it was just old-fashioned mysticism.  But it still has a certain appeal.  I mean, shouldn't religion trump science when it comes to the big questions about life and the universe?  Like hot fudge on pancakes, you know the ideas are wrong, but they feel so right.  I've got an idea.  This may sound crazy, but hear me out.  Here's the idea:  Geocentrism.  That's right, I'm talking about the idea that the Sun revolves around the Earth.  I know, it sounds a little retro, but if you think about it there are certain advantages:  1)  The Bible doesn't say anything about evolution, but it's clearly (to the extent that it's clear about anything) geocentric:   "The world is firmly established, it will not be moved." (Ps. 93:1).  This will be something for the fundamentalists to rally around.  2)  Most scientists would agree that the evidence for heliocentrism (the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun) is no better than the evidence for evolution.  3)  The main argument for geocentrism is identical to that of Intelligent Design.  Whether you call it common sense or personal incredulity, it boils down to just looking at the phenomenon in question and making up your own mind.  And the Sun looks like it revolves around the Earth, just as a bacterial flagellum (sort of) appears to have been designed.  4)  Most of the arguments against evolution are also arguments against heliocentrism.  Try this out:  "No one has ever observed the Earth going around the Sun."  It doesn't really make sense, but it sounds good!    5)  Bogus probability calculations work too.  Check this out:  The Earth consists of approximately 8.87x10^49 atoms.  Each atom is either revolving around the Sun or it's not.  Therefore the probability that the entire Earth is revolving around the Sun is 1/(2^(8.87x10^49)).  That's such a small number that it's IMPOSSIBLE that the Earth revolves around the Sun.  Tada!  6)  The same anti-evolution literature can be recycled and used against the heliocentrists.  Let's start talking about "fundamentalist heliocentric true believers" who won't even listen to geocentric arguments or allow them to be taught in schools.  Let's complain about the conspiracy between the liberal media and the atheist scientific establishment.  It'll be fun 
 I purchased this book because I am interested in environmental issues and I saw a favorable newspaper review.  I found Ms. Royte's style so rambling, long-winded, and anecdotal that it was difficult to stay focussed for the kernels of real information that occasionally popped up.  And now I feel badly for the energy wasted and trees harvested on account of my purchase. 
 If you do not have infinite patience DO NOT buy this book.  While it contains over 800 pages of nutritional information and is very comprehensive it has NO organization to it.  There is a very brief table of contents and no index at all.  The contents are arranged alphebetically but there is no color coding or shading on the edges of the pages to indicate where A stops and B begins and so on.  I HATED using it and only did so for about a week.  Then I went out and bought a new calorie counting book which also included fat and carb information, which is all I need and wanted.  My replacement book contains a Table of Contents, an index and is color coded and cost about 1/2 the price of this one.  
 There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter.  
 The school asked my daughter to read this for Novel Knowledge program. I wanted to check it out first. I was astounded at all the demonic references in this book. There is talk of fortune-tellers, demon possession, familiar spirits,going to the occult section in the book store to find answers, taro cards, wiggi boards,and spells. This is a book about introducing children to witchcraft 
 If there is one thing that rings true of the editor's review, it's that Robert Spencer is "lawyerly" - but not in the sense the editor meant, rather in the sense that he deliberately twists the facts in order to argue his case despite the facts.  This book is full of misquotations of the sayings of Muhammad (ahadith), and they are obviously deliberate as Mr. Spencer has taken the time to research the ahadith and yet still makes enormous errors in his rendering of them.  He spends a considerable amount of time quoting from the Bible and comparing his interpretation of the Christian doctrine (which I would guess a great many Christains will have issue with, as well) with what he claims to be the message of Islam.  He also spends a great deal of time attempting to assassinate the personality of Muhammad with the argument that Muhammad is the role model for all Muslims - hence by assasinating this personality he hopes to assasinate the character of Islam and all Muslims.  Despite his opening claim that he is not targeting all Muslims, the goal of his book, really, is to draw suspicion upon every Muslim in America from their non-Muslim neighbors.  His basic premise that Islam in essence is a falsehood and that all Muslims have deceived themselves with a backward and dated belief system that has failed to evolve, as he puts it, as Christianity has evolved from its backwardness by reducing the Bible to strictly metaphorical meanings.  The crux of his arguement is that Christianity is able to do this, because, as Christian scholars have shown, the Bible is in fact not the direct word of God,  but the Quran, on the other hand, is taken by Muslims as the direct, revealled word of God and hence there is little or no room for the religion to be re-interpreted.  If one reads (or listens, in the case of the audio book) carefully, though, it will not be hard to find the many instances in which Mr. Spencer contradcits himself.  All in all, it does read like a lawyer making his case in court, where it is Islam itself that is on trial.  Mr. Spencer seems to be trying to establish that the likes of Osama bin Laden are in fact   only following the letter of their religion, and hence Islam is a danger to be feared and reacted to preemtively.  Mr. Spencer seems to have strong political and religious motivations and is a far cry from his claim of being unbiased 
 Reading this book you feel embarrassed for Margaret Carlson. She brags about being a member of the Sally Queen Special Class in Washington. She shows contempt for ordinary people and their concerns. She hated Al Gore because he talked about issues on the campaign plane, issues that effect the lives of millions. She liked Bush because he served lobster ravioli on the campaign plane and made funny faces instead of boring her with discussion of issues. She recycles her columns from Time magazine. No original insights in her columns. Just conventional wisdom. No wonder Time magazine cancelled her column 
 I could not get enough vacuum to draw the oil from the crankcase... unit would not work.  I am very dissatisfied with the product 
 I'm currently working through this book now as it's the required text for my General Chemistry course(s).  I have to say that I've had a harder time reading (and understanding) this text than usual.  I would not begin to recommend this book for general study, but let's face it, the only reason you're likely to buy this book is because it's required.  So here's how to use it:  Plan to read only one or two sections (4-5 pages per Section) in a study session.  Read it, work through the solved problems, skip to the problems covering that topic at the back of the chapter and see how well you do.  Buy the solutions manual - if you write out all your work (and you should, will particularly help if you forget how to solve something and your professor gives an open book/note exam), looking over the worked solutions will help.  Write down questions on specific problems and parts of the text/chapter you didn't understand.  Ask a tutor or the instructor.  The text is a hard read, but you -can- get through it. If I can do it, so can you. 
 I have only read the introduction and Chapter 14--Restructuring Troubled Companies. My review is based on these two chapters.  I agree with the previous reviewers that the author is obsessed with attacking academic finance. He is aware of this: on page (xiii) he starts the book by saying "Many may view this book as a direct attack on academic finance; there is somehing direct to this view." Unfortunately, his attacks are based on issues that are at best irrelevant to value investing. Who cares if algebrea is needed read Brealey and Myers,  but "for reading THIS (emphasis by the author) book" it is "useless." If anything, Brealey and Myers make it clear that understanding finance requires strong analytical skills.     On the other hand, more serious attacks are groundless. On page 215, author states "Scholars are way off base in four areas." He goes on to describe these four areas as follows. "They misdefine markets ... In attempting to ascertain the social value inherent in rehabilitating troubled companies, scholars tend strongly to think only in terms of value as measured by immediate market prices for outstanding securities...In thinking about values in reorganization, scholars tend to think in terms of cash values, not present values...Scholars seem to think that the costs of bankruptcy are huge, precluding many management from seeking Chapter 11 relief."   With respect to the first three issues, there is no scholar at a respectable academic instituiton and/or published at a respectable journal making these arguments. With respect to the fourth issue, the author continues by saying " The costs ARE (emphasis bby the author) huge, but they are borne by companies, not managements." So what the scholars "seem to think" (i.e. that the costs are huge) is not "off base" after all, as the author also agrees. On the other hand, the last sentence quoted above by Whitman also suggests as if some scholars are arguing that the costs are borne by management. Again, no scholar at a respectable academic instituiton and/or published at a respectable journal making these arguments. Perhaps the author is exposed to third tier journals and third tier academics only.  I am disappointed that despite his limited exposure to academic finance, Whitman is convinced that academics are of one mind. As with many professions and many issues, there is disagreement among academics on many issues as well. Sadly, the areas he quotes above are not even among those issues. I challenge Whitman to back up his statements above by citing the scholars he is talking about so that we can all know what study he has in mind.  Practioners have much to learn from the knowledge of academics and the academics have much to learn from the experience of practitioners. Unfortunately, the author's obsession with academics makes him both deaf and mute. 
 It is true, the pages fall out faster than you can use them. And the puzzles are not jumble like in a real game. For example, in a real game no one stops to tell you, "ok look for an X-ray Attack"... and so the book is not helpful. Instead, I recommend- "Sharpen Your Tactics 
 While some consequences for the backtalk make sense like taking away a priviledge or cancelling a special outing, there are some that seem extremely selfish on the parent's part and can affect more than just your child. According to this author, if your child backtalks right before he is to perform a solo in a school band concert you should discipline him by refusing to take him to the concert. You should call up all the relatives that were going to attend the concert and tell them not to come. As for the entire band and the band director that were counting on that solo as part of the performance, you should tell them that it's not your fault he wasn't there, but your child's for backtalking. In what universe is it acceptable to ruin the entire performance for a band (often consisting of a dozen to a hundred kids) and embarrassing a band director because you were unwilling to think of a less selfish punishment? According to his book, he says you as a parent shouldn't even care how it affects the rest of the world! They just have to deal with it! That seems as immature and rude as the backtalk he says you should eliminate 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 This was the first attempt by the Alice Cooper group and it shows. They really hadn't gotten into their groove yet. There is a lot of experimental stuff with too many tempo and key changes for any fun music to really happen. Truthfully, I like the album, but my advice to anyone looking to add to their Alice Cooper library is to try "Killer", "Love It To Death", or "Billion Dollar Babies". "Pretties For You" should be added to your collection only once you are a true Alice Cooper fan, deeply devoted and interested in where it all started. I am and was, so I bought it. It's an interesting album for what it is, but maybe not for everyone 
 We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer 
 As a Christian with Jewish friends, I read the book hoping to learn more about the "life-centered" aspects of Judaism.  The title drew me in. However, I found the book very offensive to Christians. Granted, the rabbi is writing about Judaism, but the "slams" against Christianity--as others have put it so well--have no place in the book.  Kushner admits that some Jews believe this, others believe that, but his attitude seems to be that all Jews are very observant. I gather that Judaism is based on actions and, the rabbi thinks, that Christianity is based on faith alone. Devout Christians pray morning, noon, night and compline; read devotional texts based on scripture--both Hebrew Bible and New Testament; read special materials during the long period of repentance and reflecton we call Lent--not just a week or 10 days, but 40 days not counting Sundays; although we must repent each day and pray for forgiveness, and certainly do so each week in church, Lent calls us to 40 days of prayer, fasting and other disciplines--but it isn't supposed to be on display.  Jesus opposed that;  we hold a three-hour vigil on Passion Friday; say grace before meals and sometimes after. Our religion stresses the need to repent our sins, ask God for forgiveness (no "pagan" elements, thank you, Rabbi; just the One God). Do good works, be charitable. We have two to seven sacraments, dependng on the church, and many Holy Days, of which Easter is the holiest.  Much of what Jesus taught is very similar to what Hillel and others taught. Kushner says Christians need Jews to remind us that there is more to religion than faith (something like that). We get it. And that Jews need Christians to remind them to share what is so great about Judaism ... except that if Judaism had spread widely, he said, it wouldn't be Judaism because it's a "community" as much as a religion ... an ethnic group.  OK.  I went into the book very open-minded, receptive even, looking for the "life," the joy I hear there is supposed to be in Judaism.  Telling me that I was born a pagan, that I'm still part pagan because Christianity is part pagan, and slamming Christianity throughout the book, made me angry. 
 No, really. Are you kidding me? This CD got mostly 5 stars? Pinch me, someone, I must be dreaming! I like Adult Swim, but I heard this CD and most of the tracks on this CD are simply atrocious! Is this what music is coming to? Man, my father was right when he said they don't make good music no more! Blah. If this is what "experimental music" sounds like then I want NO parts of it! Ugh!    Note:  Okay, granted MOST of the tracks 1-14 suck-I just listened to all of them-the last time I listened to this CD at all was when I heard those tracks through someone else, but I didn't get to hear the ones at the end of this CD. I just clicked on the samples just now. Except for the very last one, some of the tracks (15-18) sounded BETTER than the rest. They don't even belong on this complilation...in my opinion. 
 Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year 
 My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer.  She was scared to death by what she read.  Perhaps literally.  While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC.  We're not sure she's going to make it.  She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S.  Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area.  She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking.  We pray it is not too late.  I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait.  Too long?  Who knows.  Beware 
 I bought the "Wagan 9788 Ortho Cushion" and it does not meet the deminsions at all. The total lenght was to be 19". It's 16 1/2". ETC"  How can Wagan screw up something like that, or did they?  Making something to short by accident and lying to the people until it's fixed.  
 I didn't care for this book at all.  We have purchased several children's adoption books including Jamie Lee Curtis's book and "Why was I adopted" and were very pleased. But this one I was just not comfortable with.  Can't really put my finger on the exact reason, but we returned it immediately 
 This book so wants to demonstrate that music was a crucial component of human evolution, as if the author, Steven Mithen, wants to explain why he felt the subconscious need to spend so much money on CDs by Queensryche, but he ultimately fails to prove causality. There is nothing inherent in music creation that helped the human species survive the ravages of hunger, disease, pestilence, and war. There was no "battle of the bands" being waged on the prehistoric Serengeti plain to demonstrate defiance of environmental pressures to adapt. Much of this book is pure conjecture, and Mithen again demonstrates that scientists are the worst group of people to explain music to anyone 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 Yeah, this is metal madness!!  Scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals, the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos, the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second!!  Metal is revived!!  As you can see, I'm joking.  Scooter has little baby squirel nuts, hence his super weak and annoying voice.  His lyrics about "I hate my parents, my daddy touched my privates" tripe is nothing new, and nothing pleasing to the ears.  The guitarists are very bad, they're downtuned and they only do powerchords and don't solo (because they can't).  The drummer is very basic, nothing special.  Bass?  Can't hear it.  Want the best album of 2005?  Go for "Ghost Reveries" by Opeth.  Opeth cares about music, Cold only cares about fame and money. 
 This book is what I'd call repetetive and boring. It's not the type of book I'd read if I had no other choice. It was recommended to me and every time I turned the page, I hoped it would get better. But it was basically the same story almost every time. The same idea that racism is hard. We know that. This book states that more times than is necesary. So unless you are terribly interested in Vietnam or black history, I suggest you read something else 
 Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty 
 Some of the absolute worst, most pretentious, emptiest, and most ultimately worthless drivel I have ever read. Jorge Luis Borges, regardless of all the idolatry that's been heaped upon him, had a surprising number of misses, and maybe nothing much to say. But I'll grant that he had a few high spots. Not this guy. Very derivative and disappointing stuff...I'll go elsewhere for literary thrills 
 If you are looking for a fresh look at some of Broadway's bomb, do not stop here.  Suskind wrote very little in this book of previously-published material by other people.  This book is more accuratly "compiled by" than "by" him.  I refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes (more or less) in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books.  It may be a reference for theatre students, but there isn't much else to recommend this book.  And don't get me wrong; flops are a source of morbid fascination for me.  This is why I am so disappointed with this particlar volume -- there's nothing in it that you can't get in other, better written, better compiled, and better organized tomes 
 This was my first introduction to Ayurveda despite studying yoga for several years.  I cannot judge how faithful the instructions in this book are to true Ayurvedic medicine; regardless of that, this book makes some strange and potentially hazardous medical recommendations.  Pages 143-144 recommend taking the heavy metal mercury to "enkindle the enzyme system...and regenerate the tissues."  Page 143 recommends lead as a cure for several disorders including skin diseases and venereal disease.  Neither of these recommendations are accompanied by a warning that modern medicine has clearly identified these two metals as being toxic to humans.  While these metals are promoted without warnings about their toxicity, the author warns readers about the dangers of vitamin intake.  On page 87, the author claims that overpresciption of vitamins to patients by Western physicians may cause them to suffer from "hypervitaminosis." Page 140 makes great claims about the curative powers of onions.  It claims that when used as a nasal inhalant or as eye drops they will relieve acute epileptic seizures, reduce cholesterol, and serve as a heart tonic.  Ouch...that stings even just thinking about it. If the preceeding prescriptions haven't deterred you from subscribing to this book's recommendations, then the following might.  Pages 42-44 suggest drinking a cup of your own urine each morning in order to cleanse and detoxify your large colon 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 This anthology looks at "queer" themes in Spanish-language and Latino cultural productions.  Unfortunately, like many gay Hispanic books, there is too much focus on tedious Spanish materials and too little focus on the cool stuff that gay and lesbian Latino artists are currently doing.  I prefered Munoz' "Disidentifications" and Manrique's "Imminent Maricones" much more than this.  However, this is one of the first gay Hispanic anthologies, so I must give it some credit for its originality 
 "The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!! 
 The basketball hoop was great until the hoop wouldnot stay on the back board. This problem started about 1 week after I received this gift for Christmas. I've been unable to use it since then 
 This book is awful.  The writing is bad, the plot is thin, the characters are underdeveloped.  Synners had potential, but ruined it with pages and pages of dream-type sequences and unexplained ramblings.  There were so many characters that it was ridiculous to keep track of them all.  Important events were skipped over and not explained at all, substituted with phrases resembling "a few days later...everything was fine."  I do not recommend this book 
 Heidi Talbot has a lot of growing up to do. I recently saw her perform with Cherish the Ladies and she has NO stage presence. She startes at the ground while her bandmates perform and she looks so bored that she drains and depletes your energy down to nothing.  After seeing her and then listening to her CD, I fell asleep due to boredul. Please save your money and buy a different singers album 
 This book seemed like the answer to my prayers.  I fit all of the descriptions on the back cover, and I was very stressed out most of the time so I purchased it.  What it doesn't tell you is that the entire premise of the book and the cornerstone of this Dr.'s practice is DHEA.  If you are under 40 years old or on any kind of hormones, including birth control, you cannot take DHEA, and you cannot benefit from this book.  That is about half of the female population!!  Also, DHEA is a hormone, not a vitamin, and there are no conclusive studies to prove that it does not have long term side effects.  Even if I was over 40 and not taking the pill I would feel very uncomfortable taking a hormone that may or may not lead to cancer, etc.  Bottom line- unless you are over 40 years old, not taking hormones but want to start, DO NOT waste your time and money on this book!! 
 I picked up this book as it looked like some nice light reading to fill in some aspects of eastern religion unfamiliar to me.   Perhaps I'm spoiled by reading books by actual participants in a religion, but even an external observer should be able to provide more insight than is found here. I confess to having read only the Buddhist sections, but they were so misguided and innacurate I won't be reading more.   The author seems to be disinterested and even have disdain for the subject. Perhaps in an attemempt to be user-friendly, the book has an undertone of humor, but unfortunately it all has a negative tone.  If you have never read a book on eastern religion before, this would not be a good first step, in my opinion 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 This book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots. It devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human. However, I feel that the book falls short on several aspects, and I found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section. I thought I would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index! As such, the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots. For the ~$20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index. Having some experience with other parrots and with other books, I find the book lacking and plain.   I guess the book will appeal to the non-science types and those who just want to have a generic guide of how parrots behave. For those of us that want to be our parrots best friend the book falls way short of its goal. 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 Do you love to hear spoiled women talk about how hard they have it with thier maids, nannies and how you should dress like them, eat like them, and reform your style of thinking to be exactly like them...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! Super annoying Darla Shine spends 90% of the book telling us how fab she is!!! She tells you how other people repulse her because of the way they shop, eat, act, and dress then goes on to give such handy tips as you can wear sweat pants as long as they are tight?!? She also seems to have some pent up agression towards the television show, desperate housewives, taking the title as a personal insult. Darla is most definitly desperate but a housewife...no not really... SAVE YOUR MONEY and call the meanest most shallow woman you know instead. 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 I have not seen it, have no desire to see it. Give me a brea 
 This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the "dummies" series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog.     It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense.     If you have to read a "quick book" find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc 
 ryan and scott from 'desert sons' continue their adventures.  their desert home suddenly seems to be bursting from the seams with homosexuals, each of whom seem to have some wicked agenda.  the boys must deal with all of this while also dealing with stresses on their relationship. i, like another reviewer, made the mistake of buying both 'desert sons' and this book at the same time.  this is a very sloppy work.  the characters are, or become, incredibly two-dimensional.  all the boys seem to only have 'sex' as a hobby.  the reactions of most characters to plot points is either forced or ridiculous.  the time of the story, never really established, is suddenly set as 1990/91 - in quite a jarring fashion, seeing the assumption is that it is occuring in the modern day.  again, the editing is poor to non-existent.  see if you can get by the three or four lines containg about twenty "huffs" without doing a doubletake.  every character seems to have a veritable horn of plenty attached to their bank account.  the finale, as it is, does nothing but wraps everything up like a neat little package.   very disappointing sequel to a very disappointing book 
 I've watched this film about 4 times.  I don't really know what it's about.  I should go out, buy a copy, and watch it about 10 more times.  The story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic.  It ends with a finding of a greater one.  In between there's a blur.  I think I'm going to buy it.  That's all 
 This has to be Dolph's suckiest movie.  I'm a huge fan, and I own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis.  But do not buy this movie, save your money and buy one of Dolph's better movies like Army of one or Men of War.  Personally though I'm pumped for the release of masters of the Univers 
 Up until this point, the band had always stayed true to their guitar roots. Even if their songs had an "80's" feel to them, they were always guitar rock at their core. Not anymore. With the departure of Don Barnes, and the arrival of Max Carl on Keyboards, their trademark sound was gone. Gone was Barnes's strong guitar and vocals. In was Carl's cheesy, even wimpy, keyboards. I'll give him his due, he is not a bad singer, but he has no edge, no attitude. Simply put, he is not a rocker. Jeff Carlisi and Donnie Van Zant are the only reason this gets 2 stars. Otherwise, it's a 1 star effort. They just didn't sound like 38 Special anymore. They became a pop band. Ronnie was rolling in his grave over this one. How could his brother be a part of something like this 
 While I'm a big fan of Celine, this CD was a big disapointment. There are only two really good numbers on the CD while the other 13 range from fair to just plain bad.  On this CD it appears that Celine tried numbers that really aren't her style, and are "dangerous" to her voice. She is best when she does ballads and love songs.  A "Rock" or "Rap" star she is not 
 Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation 
 Mary's rounding up of Protestant revolutionaries, while deplorable, pales in comparison to the crimes of her father King Henry VIII and her half-sister Queen Elizabeth I.    Prior to Henry and Elizabeth, Catholicism was woven into the fabric of English society.  You can still find echoes of it today in everything from patterns of speech (the omnipresent adjective "bloody" is a truncation of the oath "By Our Lady") to place names (Blackfriars refers to a Dominican priory).    That is why it was necessary for Henry and then Elizabeth to turn England into a virtual police state to effect the former's violent, imposed Anglican revolution.  Elizabeth executed more than 800 Englishmen in the first year alone of her forty-year reign.  Much as Protestants imitated and countered Catholic books on authentic martyrs once they grew in popularity (through the so-called "Foxe's Book of Martyrs"), so too does this book merely attempt to undo the growing recognition by scholars that the anti-Catholic "Whig interpretation" of history that held sway for centuries was and is nothing more than state propaganda 
 This album is musically no worse than a lot of the Top-40 fare one typically finds on the radio.  What sets it apart from the pack is the vocal contortions of Rob Thomas.  This guy's gutteral croakings and alternate whinings -- which some have described as "heartfelt" -- will almost induce vomiting.  Self pity has never been so wretchedly on display as on this grossly over-played CD.  Avoid at all costs!  
 I recently bought this "Literary Classics" edition of "The  Diaries of Adam & Eve" expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled "Translated by Mark Twain" and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful "first family" stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition 
 This book was recomended to me by a naturopath. It was easy enough to read in just one evening. The sections about how bones grow and what your risk factors are for getting osteoporosis were quite good. There is also good advice about what vitamins and minerals in addition to calcium to include in your diet, as well as the importance of vitamin D and sunshine, for calcium absorbtion. However, the food section is confusing. Nelson does not mention sea vegetables as the best food source of calcium and minerals to include in a healthy diet. And since she has the opinion that a person can get all the calcium they need from food sources, she should have included a more accurate calcium food chart in her book. For example, spinach, which tops the vegetable calcium secton, contains a lot of oxalic acid which interfers with calcium absorbtion. Nelson mentions the oxalic acid problem with some foods, but never mentions exactly which foods contain the highest amounts. Instead she says we should eat these foods for other reasons. So, why is spinach at the top of the calcium chart? Let's have a more accurate chart before telling people they can just add up what they are taking in with the chart she provides. Also, in her section on exercises she encourages women over 50 to jump vertically to retain calcium. A woman should gradually build up to 2 full minutes of jumping. What if a persons knees are not in alignment? Jumping is one of the most jarring and hardest things a person can do to their knee joints, especially if they are heavy on their feet. A woman who is over 50 and not used to exercising could easily get injured with this jumping program. I am over 50, and I already exercise 5 or 6 days a week, doing aerobics, running and weight training. I tried jumping vertically at a fitness center in front of a mirror to make sure I did it correctly. Then I went on to do a leg press, which I do on a regular basis, and my left knee hurt. My personal trainer said running would be much better for me than jumping. I do not have joint problems, yet, but I could after Neilson's exercise program. Also, the medication section encourages every woman to consider hormone replacement therapy. Does we all really need this therapy? I am discouraged that this book was rated so highly and recomended. It was mostly a waste of money. Only the first couple sections in the book were really worth reading. Check it out at the library or buy it used if you must 
 I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates.  For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers?  When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?  This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.  This book is supposed to be a "Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.  I was VERY disappointed with this book 
 After telling us that "loving yourself" is the key to happiness, the author then tells us that "we can not make it alone......I need to see my worth and beauty reflected in your eyes." p.24.  This puts people right back where they were, addicted to others.  Sure, human beings fundamentally need other people, but only after becoming secure without them 
 I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn 
 Don't waste your money on this book.  It read like it was written by a child 
 I was actually thinking about buying this book; until I saw the authors childish and very rude remarks to customers that have bought his book and replyed to it. Do not support this A hole!! Look for someone else. This man does not deserve your hard earned money!. See for youeselfs. skepdic.com 
 I'm very disappointed by the lack of content in this book. After breezing through it in one night I felt like there was so much more that can be covered. Most of the book were pictures the author has taken for portfolios he's build. The quality of pictures are ok at best. It would have been more useful if he used portraits from photographers to contrast to his own style. The reader had to take the authors word on what looks right and wrong. 1 or 2 more view points would have made a huge difference.   Specific information on important aspect of shooting the shots were also left out. The author should have gave more insight on picking locations, using the right lighting, instructing the models, and how to conceptualize the pictures. If the focus of this book was not on the technicalities of portfolio photography but rather on working with models there is still be a huge gap in information. More insight and techniques for instructing the model during the shoot or details on the financial aspect of this type of photography would have been very useful.  Reading through the book, I feel like the author thew it together based on  a few notes and added pictures from his own portfolio. As it stands, most the book can be summarized in only 10-15 pages. The content fails only to pierce the most basic of details on portfolio shooting. I would recommend readers to seek out other literature on the subject as this entire book would only cover what would be a chapter in most comprehensive books on model photography 
 I was disappointed in this book because the format is too small to do the art justice.  Such a beautiful book with wonderful information should have been published in a larger format.  Difficult to see the detail 
 Like others who have reviewed this book, I was very disappointed. I was completely surprised when the story was resolved on page 200 and, it looked like I had 1/2 the book left to read!  I will try the next one in case things improve.  If not, I'm done with the series 
 This book was so dry and so boring. It was very clinical. I was hoping for a list of the sypmtoms of candidiasis and some helpful suggestions on how to control the condition. Most of the book was not helpful or useful to me. 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive.   Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked?    Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events.  The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty.  They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra.   She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here?  I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome.  Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance.   Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material.  Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great. 
 I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money 
 How could anyone reward this piece of garbage?  I read a few pages of this trash - loaned to me of course - and I found it nothing more than an excuse to blame others, use racism, and drugs as the reason that this garbage did what he did.  I'm a vegeterian so I would never call him an animal, so for me,  a piece of excrement would be the most just description. Perhaps he should become a nanny for Jessie's illegitimate child? 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
  I haven't purchased the book yet, though I think I will.  I truly beleive that whatever child you get is a blessing from God and only He will decide the sex. However, I also believe in doing whatever you can, on your own  to tip the scale and then leave it to Him.  My husband and I have a beautiful, smart, funny, blind little boy.  His blindness comes froma genetic disease that is 99% more likely to coour in males, so we would like to have a girl next.  We checked into gender selection thorugh spinning and they only give an 85% chance as well.  IVF is not an option due to finances. If we try and the gender selection works, we will add some stars on the review. However, our son is the light of our lives and we re incredibly blessed to have him despite and because of his blindness.  We will remember and hope you will too, that any child..boy, girl perfect or with special needs is a blessing and we will love him or her no matter what.  
 Boring and out of touch describes this book by Santorum.  I am a Republican, and I can honestly say that I am glad he is out of office 
 I love how someone was calling the people who thought that they "werent" the same, stupid. first of all, the person who is the center of this band is named kris, as bright eyes is conor. they have seperate last names as well! would you look at that! yeah, he does sound like conor, you have to be an earless brainless idiot to not see the similarities. dont act like youre above everyone and super obscure by saying they dont sound alike. because they do. and conor has uniquely adopted this style of music which is.. obviously being posed off of. i could see if an angle maybe used his singing style and then chose his words and writing style differently, or even music writing style, but he doesnt, he goes right with copying off of bright eyes, and that's not very creative or commendable, whether or not he is a drunk like conor or not. just because conor drinks doesnt mean he puts on any less of a good show.. here's a question.. ever been to a bright eyes show? oh, obviously not 
 This book stinks. It's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information. Pass... if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money 
 I think the book is very flippant and uninformative.  If you are looking for hard facts, skip this one.  I'd like to return it for a refund and I'd be embarrased to pass it on 
 [...] which ask for evidence of Ramakrishna's true mysticism. I tell them that the evidence is the devotees themselves who follow His teachings. You cannot create wise people like Vivekananda and his brother disicples just by following a "mad" man. What about the visions of Ramakrishna devotees and saints? Yeah you can rubbish ALL of them as hallucinations. Well that is not your evidence anyway, right? I saw thousands and thousands of saints and devotees who cite Ramakrishna as their guru and these people are the best among men - you feel it when you are in their midst and their life is an example (again an unscientific mind trashes ALL of them). Are all of these men getting inspired by a "mad" man then? Are ALL their visions, wisdom and experience false then? How far can you go and say ALL are cheating without even provideing evidence and deluding yourself? Now, why talk of others. I can best talk about myself as evidence. I have seen perceptible change in myself for better after reading and following His teachings. If you really need evidence against Kali's Child - I tell you to first read His life and teachings and IMPLEMENT in your life. You can see yourself who He is and everything will be self-evident. There cannot be a best subject of study than yourself (your mind). And I am sure you cannot/wont do that becasue as yours is a weak mind that cannot experiment anything, but likes to see what it wants to! By the way, what is in one's mind, thats what one sees. Even the kissing of Jesus feet by adultress woman can be seen in a perverted way if the person's mind is heaped in lust. As Jesus Himself said, "Blessed are those who are pure, for they shall see God." Kali's Child is a fit testimony to that teaching! You yourself can experience how you see "things" in others that dont exist (in other person) just because your mind "sees" and "thinks" so. If you have not learnt these simple lessons yet, well only prayer to God will help that your mind might grow 
 The book arrived with a missing ink stick. Also, the brushes them selves are only 3 inches long - hard for an adult to lose. This gift is OK as a stocking stuffer for a child, but I would not recommend it for an adult 
 So what do you think of this? `Out of Reach' 'Into the Sun' 'Submerged' `Today You Die.' They are the list of recent Seven Seagal films. Don't they sound like a message or warning from the Heaven to the star of these films? Well, anyway, I really hope that Seagal is aware of his career decline that really coming to the end very fast.  `Into the Sun' has one interesting thing, and that is the location of Japan. Considerable amounts of the film are, I think, shot somewhere outside Japan (like the inside shots of the Yakuza's office), but the unique urban feeling of Tokyo should be called one of the merits of the film. Unfortunately, neither director Mink nor Seagal seems to realize that, wasting every chance to make the film more original in whatever way they want. (By the way, this film was released theatrically in Japan on November 26, 2005, in more than 90 theaters all over the country. Can you believe that?)  Anyway, the film starts with the assassination of the Governor of Tokyo Prefecture, whose aggressive views on foreigners are causing controversy. (And here, you can see a ten-second cameo of Chiaki Kuriyama, `Go-go Yubari' in `Kill Bill Vol.1'.) The governor's inclusion is a nice touch for his outspoken portrait suggests the real governor Mr. Ishihara, who is equally outspoken.  But everything goes down from there. I don't know why, but one CIA agent Travis (Steven Seagal) is called in to investigate the case with FBI (why?) agent (Matthew Davis), by another CIA agent and Travis's acquaintance William Atherton. Before you say `CIA agent, not again!' listen, the story/script is co-written by Steven Seagal himself. No Japanese police would interfere with their jobs, because none of them appears. Even though the governor of the prefecture (of which population easily exceeds 10 million) is gunned down, the police in Japan is not needed.  Instead of Japanese police, Yakuza step in. Actually, as you see, it is one of the young ambitious Yakuza Kuroda (Takao Osawa) that is responsible for the attack, and Yakuza of older generation don't like it, especially ... but wait, where does Seagal fit in? Oh, don't worry, what he does is simple. He goes where he should go (I don't know how, but he knows the right person), and he kills whoever attacks him, or whoever looks very bad, using swords and, if he likes, chopsticks. And romance? There is one, and Seagal's Travis and his love talk about love in a Japanese-style garden in a very childish way.    The story makes no sense, but it's OK as long as the actions are reasonable. Are they reasonable? Admittedly, considering the film's B-movie status, the actions as a whole are better than some of the previous films of his. They are what you call `just OK,' but as you see, he is no longer the Seagal in the 80s, when he could display the real martial arts with authentic touch. Again, his actions here are helped by fast and quick editing.   Some of the Japanese actors are respected veterans such as Masato Ibu (who plays the older Yakuza boss) and Akira Terao (playing a tycoon of big company). Their acting is more than decent, that of the professional actors.  Just in case you're interested in trivia, here's a brief note about the film. You can see the clip of one `Gamera' film, in which the face of Seagal's real-life daughter Ayako Fujitani can be seen briefly on the TV twice in Yakuza's room. And you can hear the voice of Seagal at the end credit song `Don't You Cry' co-written by Seagal ... again.   So, is he getting better? I don't think so, and probably I think he missed the last train to leave the direct-to-video land where he got stuck for a long time. What he needs is better action or commercially viable support (like DMX), definitely not singing 
 It is a beautiful mold, and I was excited to make a cake in the shape of a sunflower. I am a pretty experienced baker, and my success rate, even with tricky procedures, is very high. In five attempts to use this cake pan, each ime increasing how slavishly I greased and floured the alleged "non stick" surface, and being careful to remove it per the instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes on a rack after removing from the oven, I never got it out in one piece. The mold's detailed corners are too sharp to cleanly release the cake. I even tried letting it fully cool in the hopes some shrinkage would help get the cake out. I own other Nordic Ware pans and have had better luck with them, but this particular mold is a loser, which was very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially be if it worked. If you want to use it for Jello, I'm sure it's fine, but for cakes, it's  a waste of time and money. 
 I never received this book.  Dozens of other books ordered from Amazon came without complication.  I would still like to have this book.  Send it, when you have the time 
 I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," but not many.    If you're another 12-step 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like "One Day at a Time," you'll probably really, really like _When Society Becomes an Addict_. I myself found it to be one of the worst self-help books I've ever seen ... and in a genre glutted with self-indulgence, pseudo-science, and hidden agendas, that's saying a lot.    If there is anything we emphatically do *not* need more of in politics, it's therapy. Lift your head out of your 12-step cocoon and look around you: We've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper child-rearing to murder. We've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized, the easily offended, the "oppressed," and, most of all, "da chyldrun." And no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her "sensitive side," often with short, sappy, pseudo-heartwarming "personal interest" films.    Schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem, but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize American society more. Uh, when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys, I think we've feminized society quite enough. And I'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies.    Too bad it had to take September 11th to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than consensus-seekers, empathizers, and nurturers -- we need leaders, individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments, and warriors and heroes. Of both sexes 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever seen.  It is very depressing.  It does not show an accurate description of the last 100 years.  It shows all the war and killing and negative side of everything.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.  The pictures are gross!!  Please do not show this book to children unless you want them to think everything is terrible.  I usually love books like this but was very upset by this book 
 I can not believe that this debate is going on.  These zealots need to climb out from under their rock and step into the real world.  Hello, FICTION.  You, people, do remember the word, I hope.  The Harry Potter series is wonderfully written and opens up the imagination and gets the kids out from the television and video games.  Come on people, kids are only kids once.  God isn't going to strike you dead for reading them and the devil isn't going to invade your children for reading them either.  Get over this stupid idotic idea that this is unholy 
 This is a decent case for the Tungsten E, but make no mistake about it, it will not work for the E2 Model.  The plastic latch is cheap and the closure could be more secure.  
 I played this CD and was not happy.  I had to return the item becasue it skipped really bad on almost every song 
 This was recommended to me based on prior purchase - Mofro. It sucked, instrumental only, no lyrics 
 I swear if it wasn't that i liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much i'd just break this game at then i'd move on and be happy. But i can't do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that i did'nt want to waste money. This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game. Oh my god this is so childish. You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn't feel like doing that in this one. You are a monkey-man! How stupid is that. Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one im just happy i beat in and can put that awful exp. behind me. AHHHHHHHHHH 
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 Simply put, this is one of the books that shattered Schlesinger's credibility as a legitimate historian once and for all.  Once he was "Artie," the precocious high-flying historian/prodigy, amazing his peers & elders with his dazzling talents as an author & scholar.  Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore.  Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.  How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history?  It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration.   He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe 
 This is a 'lets make fun of the French' book.  In reality, a similar book can be written by many expatriates in every country, including foreigners living in the US and New York.  Mr. Gupnik refuses to accept the differences between the different cultures and seemingly expects the French to behave as if they are funny speaking Americans.    This is a useless book, fake and pompous.  Don't waste your time and money with it 
 I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work "Your Money or Your Life".  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book 
 And if you're not into comics, you won't care. What was Ronin Ro on?   Aside from glaring proofreading mistakes (on the same page, we are told that Kirby was stationed at an army base in 1945 and honorably discharged in 1943), this writer decides to take one of the most interesting and argued-about subjects in popular culture and present it as one continuous, here's-what-happened narrative, without ever citing his sources. No pictures, no index, nothing's ever sourced, corroborated or contested. Not only are conflicting versions of events never explored, but neither are the various other books and magazines Ro cribbed from ever cited. Hack-work, through and through.  If I sound angry, it's because this should have been great, at least as absorbing as Gerard Jones's excellent book, Men of Tomorrow. A good version of this book can be done, and I'd gladly shell out hardcover money for it.  Instead, it's like standing in a comics store, listening to some fool blather on, thinking to yourself, "you don't know that. How can anybody know that? Who told you that? You made that up," and finally, "just ring me up and let me out of here. 
 Usually, when I purchase music, I'll tape off my favorite 4 or 5 cuts and forget about the rest of the songs. Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone. If you're thinking of buying this one, in my opinion, you can't go wrong. Try it...you'll like it 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Yet another whitewashing and self-serving attempt to claim that Ronald Reagan "won the Cold War" - by the way, it was my impression that the Cold War was not in any sense 'won', it was rather something that just ended, for the most part because it was widely acknowledged within the USSR that the Soviet style economy and political system could neither be sustained nor reformed.  Secondly, these kinds of right-wing apologias always wallow smugly in the assertion that Western 'liberals' never perceived the real threat presented by the neo-Stalinist regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe. Well, things have changed, and now there's a new, possibly greater threat. Did the Reagan administration (of which Charen was a part) foresee this later threat when they were happily funding, training and arming the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan, from whose numbers were to come the Taliban and Osama bin Laden? By all accounts, these Islamic warriors were at that time just as murderous, just as cruel, just as intent on the destruction of all 'infidels' (the US as much as the USSR), as they are now: the only difference is that, when they were the CIA's clients, they were committing their atrocities as 'freedom fighters', whereas now they commit them as 'terrorists' 
 What a shame.  Dianne Reeves may have the best voice in jazz today, but in this CD every song is over produced, arranged, and most sadly, oversung.  Anyone who has listened to Ms. Reeves sing knows she has great vocal ability, but it feels like this is an attempt to see how stylized and how much vocal gymnastics she can wow us with.  From the original songs (which are awful and should never be a part of the best of, to the couple of standards which again are over arranged (and over the top with vocalization), this CD was totally disapointing.  You want to hear the best of Diane Reeves, get the soundtract to "Good Night and Good Luck" as this is truley an artist at the top of her vocal game with great arrangments of wonderful songs 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 Usually when I buy an exercise book I expect clear concise directions and maybe a picture to illustrate what exactly the correct form would be. Well, if you are expecting this out of this book you my as well forget it. Although it was very informative, black and white pictures that aren't even shown for all exercises is not going to cut it. For example for a tricep kickback it doesn't really show you the ways that it would be wrong which can lead to an injury. If you are looking for information go for it; but if you want something that will show you the right way with pictures, skip it 
 My dlink router works fine with one wirelessly connected computer using a netgear adapter, but my experience has been like that of others: this belkin adapter flakes on and off - getting a weak or no signal, then full strength, back and forth.  I am going to return it 
 This is one of our favorite movies.....but, when we sat down to enjoy it, the last 2 scene segments would not play.  Very unsettling 
 I was really looking forward to this book--I've read RMB since Rubyfruit Jungle and I love mysteries--but my anticipation came to a screeching halt on page 4, where Ms. Brown produced this piece of pandering: "The whole point of the ban [on English foxhunting] was to punish those suspected of wealth or title from (sic) enjoying themselves... It was perfectly fine with [those who passed the ban] if the farmers shot the beautiful creatures... Better yet, Americans did not hunt to kill the fox."  No.  It isn't all about the seedy underclasses hating the wealthy (though given the centuries of class privilege in England, it might be understandable if that were the case).  It's not to punish those with wealth or title for enjoying themselves... though I'm sure those with wealth and titles were equally annoyed when droit du seigneur was abolished.  The whole point of that ban was to put an end to the bloody and horrible way in which English hunts conclude--the painful, terrifying death of the fox.  You see, I'm one of those ignorant Yankees who signed one of the many petitions to Parliament to try to bring an end to the bloody business of British-style foxhunting.   I don't recall the English foxhunters ever offering to compromise--to merely hunt the fox, and not allow the dogs to tear it to pieces when it's cornered. It's one thing to shoot an animal that's endangering one's poultry--at least it's quick and relatively merciful.  A British fox-hunt is anything but.  Ms. Brown tosses off the very important difference between US and English hunts as though the death of the fox, and the manner of its death, does not matter.  It matters to me--as I am sure it matters to the fox.  The English hunt begins early, with gamekeepers going around to where the foxes live and stopping their dens--blocking their means of escape.  Not very "sporting!" - but if the fox were allowed to escape, the ladies and gentlemen of the hunt would be denied the pleasure of the kill, and that would be such a disappointment!  Let's look at it from the fox's point of view, as Ms Brown does in her books.  What would happen to her beloved foxes--what if Target or Comet were unfortunate enough to live in Merrie England?  What about sweet, intelligent little Inky?  How would the story go...  "Panting, exhausted, Inky dashed through the creek, backtracked to muddle her trail.  She ran along a fallen log, cut through a thicket, and dove for her escape hole.  It was blocked by a stone, too big to move, too deeply wedged to move around.   She gasped, whirled--but it was too late. The hounds closed in, snarling.  Inky screamed in agony as her hind leg was torn off, but her adrenaline-charged heart was pumping so fast that she bled to death in seconds.    The whipper-in beat off the dogs and pulled out the bleeding stump of what had been her beautiful, luxuriant tail.  He took the still-warm trophy of their victory over to the youngest member of the hunt, an eight-year-old old boy, and smeared Inky's blood across the child's face.  The boy fought back nausea.  This was the glory of the hunt--his father, his mother expected him to be a man!  So he did his best, and smiled, and wished he were a million miles away."  I used to buy Rita Mae Brown's books in hardcover.  When her misplaced modifiers and brand placement got too irritating--her last Sneaky Pie book read like an ifomercial for the Virginia wine industry--I started reading the hardcover at the library and buying the paperback.     At this point... I don't even know if I'm going to finish this book.   The disconnect of making her foxes such interesting, lovable people (her animals have always been more interesting than her humans) while kissing up to the savage brutality of English foxhunting is just more hypocrisy than I want to deal with in recreational reading.  I don't care if Ms Brown or anyone else wants to chase foxes till they're blue in the face; I'm sure it's great exercise.  But I draw the line at being told what to believe when it comes to humane treatment of animals.  It's sheer nonsense to pretend there's no difference between the US and UK style of fox-hunting or wax indignant over how those of us who think British foxhunting is barbaric are trying to punish the poor hunters. I'm sure Ms. Brown's fox-hunting friends were hugging themselves with glee over her polemic on page 4, but it's just lost her a reader. 
 Although the arrival/condition of the book was perfect, the content was very limited.  I learned nothing new and feel I wasted my money.  My parrot is still obnoxious.  I had so hoped I would learn techniques to change his behavior 
 To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:  "This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it."  
 This is a cheaply made, over-priced product.  It didn't last a week and I paid over 30 dollars for it and since I ordered it early as a Christmas gift - I can't return it because it has been over 30 days!!  The drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way, therefore the coins fall to the bottom, get stuck, etc.  Total waist of money that I now cannot get back! 
 No only are there no heroes in this book there are very few worthwhile words as well. Everyone and everything is painted in a negative light-with the exception of Eddie. Considering he is the "painter" of the book that is not surprising-his bragging style is pathetic at best. According to the book every important person valued him, every idea came from him, every person was using him, every woman wanted him-generous to a fault...........what a phony yarn. I agree w/a quote he used of Debbie's which went something like "the best part of him was his sperm" and would go on to add "fertilized" sperm so only his children get the credit. Simply distasteful 
 I was prepared to spend the original $26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack. At that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 CDs ordered. I was refunded the money to "The Last Starfighter" due to an error listing. When I went to re-order, the new price is $49.95. What a joke! Someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin. I would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition, but until it is sold at a fair price, I will reserve my rating 
 Well what *IS* normal anyway?  If normal to you is giving your child a book with lots of comic style nudity, directions for masterbating, exactly HOW to have sex (etc.) then you might want to grab this and run!  If your child is average to above average intellectually he or she will have a full understanding of how to pleasure him or herself and how to perform the deed by the time they are finished.  Of course there are warnings of pregancy, sickness (STD'S), and death (AIDS) if they are to do this while unprotected, so no worries there.  You'd have to see the book to believe it.  I was shocked when I started looking through it, and was doubling over with laughter that I had actually considered giving this to my 10 year old son.  Actually, I did hand it to him in the car before I actually looked at it and he was shocked by the second page, gave it back and said "I think this is WAY too old for me Mama", and it turned out he was right!  I'll never hand him something like that again without looking first 
 Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 In "Big Weather," Mark Svenvold recalls the time he spent in 2004 tagging along with veteran storm chaser Matt Biddle.  The book is meant to be about storm chaser culture and associated elements, but uneven storytelling mars what would otherwise be a very cool book.  Svenvold is a poet-in-residence at Fordham University, and it shows.  In some cases (such as Chapter 4: Catastrophilia), it shows a little too much.  When Svenvold is talking about being on a chase, or the people who are part of and/or affected by chase culture, he's great.  When he tries to get flowery, it bogs down the book.  I'm sure there was a point to Chapter 4; I just wish he had gotten to it sooner, with a clear path to it.  And that's the overall problem with "Big Weather."  For a topic that is, at its essence, unpredictable, crazy, and hold-your-breath heart stopping, he doesn't always convey that.  I know that there's a lot of waiting associated with chasing, but Svenvold made storm chasing seem downright dreamy.  I think the book would have been better if he had stuck with the journalistic, straight-to-the-point style he used when describing different chase events.  I don't agree with other reviewers that say he is anti-Christian, anti-Bush, or anti-other chasers.  I think he was just trying to be objective while observing the people who not only live in Tornado Alley, but are also residents of the Bible Belt.  Perhaps the book would have been less offensive if he had been more objective, but I don't think that's his style.  One place where I did think he was offensive (or at least borderline) was his constant referral to the people in the chasing industry as "geeks" or "dorks."  I wasn't sure if that was an in-joke he was repeating or if he was being purposely derogatory.  I think, in a way, this was meant to be Svenvold's "expose" type book, just like recent bestsellers "The Nanny Diaries" or "The Devil Wears Prada," except, of course, he didn't try to gloss his experiences by hiding them in fiction.  It might have been a more interesting read if he did.  Overall, it's worth checking it out from the library.  But there are better memoirs out there that are worth savoring and keeping 
 I have to agree with everyone.  Two lines are very nice, but the lack of a mute button makes this phone unusable for conference calls.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to replace it with another phone that has two lines and a mute button.  Fatal design flaw.  Lack of a lighted "message waiting indicator light" is also a big drawback, but there is a faint message waiting indicator on the LCD 
  Remember how freakin' cool Lords of Madness was?  The aboleth, the illithids, the FLESHWARPER?  Even had "Innsmouth look"-style feats, so you could get your Call of Cthulu on with your 7th level druid what with the tentacles and the pseudonatural wild shape and all!  MAN, it was COOL!  Well, I felt great about finally getting Races of the Dragon, all hoping it would be half as awesome as Libris Mortis or Complete Adventurer and everything.... And... about half-way through this book I felt like I had just found a turd in my green salad.      Everything magical is devoted to the Sword-of-Shanarra ripoff sorceror class, (and not a thing for wizards, HELLO???), the fleshgrafting rules contradict the rules in EVERY other book with Flesh grafting (Fiend Folio, Libris Mortis and Lords of Madness if you're counting), and the new races are just plain STUPID.  And I do mean STUPID: "Hey, look at me, I'm a 'spellscale,' I  LOOK like a freackin' purple elf with some painted junk on my face."  But you know, for those of you who always wanted to play a kobold, now you get your shot, 'cause hey, they rack up in here, man, let me tell you. Oh yeah, and the art's not worth much, either. Don't even bother with the feats, they reek, too; MAYBE the spellcaster tactical feat that lets you do the really obvious "This time for sure!" spell-casting to hit a critter or overcome SR.  It doesn't take a whole lotta brainpower to make the sorceror even dumber, and they did that much right.    One good thing, an EXCELLENT thing, in fact: 7 new Power Word Spells. Of course, there are problems here, too.  "Power Word: Pain" is, technically speaking, broken as hell: 1st level wizard spell that does 1d6 + 1d6 / round to one target; up to 4d4 rounds depending on current HP much like all Power Word spells. That's only first level if the damage is nonlethal, buddy; 2nd or 3rd at least.  I'll let people take any of them, though, if they also spend spell slots on "Mighty Wallop" and "Greater Mighty Wallop", though -- I kid you not there are spells with those names in there.  If you can cast either of them without laughing, you DESERVE "Power Word: Maladroit", too.  I guess these guys wanted to make up for the purple painted elves by using a fancy word for "Clumsy."  All in all, the weakest effort I've seen out of WotC so far, even worse than Weapons of Legacy.  If you want to spend money on a D&D book, get Lords of Madness or Sandstorm, instead 
 I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as "Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it 
 Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Yoshimi, but this is just atrocious. Maybe I just don't get it, but I don't want to have to "get" random sounds with Wayne screeching in the foregound. The point of music is for me to listen to it and enjoy it, not be constantly confused about what is coming out of my speakers. Nothing on here comes even close to the greatness of (in order):  Do You Realize? Are You a Hypnotist? Fight Test Yoshimi part 1 Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell Suddenly Everything Has Changed  The only two songs semi worth listening to on this album are: Vein Of stars Pompeii  Download these two and don't waste your time on the rest 
 Not sure what is worse, the horrible script or the horrible acting. Typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script. Watching Schneider dress in women's clothes for an entire movie is just creepy. Using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie. 
 I can't receive this book now. Please help me to check it.I need this book now 
 The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1.  Why:  no letterbox format.  After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan & scan?  Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines 
 I bought this book for christmas. I had hoped to improve my knowledge of upholstery through it, but I was dissappointed!. This book has only black and white MINI pictures!!. How in the world can one learn to upholster with black and white pictures. These pictures are so bad that they sometimes look just like a black patch? For me, buying this book was a big waste of money. An upholstery book with no good picture is not interesting to read and very very boring!! 
 The cover claims that the book has been "revised and updated for the digital age," but Winston's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated. The term, "PDA," does not even appear in the index 
 The first thing I noticed about this book is how much it jumps around. Jude Fishers first two books were pretty good, but you couldnt really understand where she was going in the first one. Sure, this book clears it up (sort of) and you know where shes going with the plot. However, by now about 6 main characters are spread out across Elda and she constantly is jumping between each one. Also, she makes some of the characters extremely unintelligent, such as Erno. Erno Hampton was overly obsessed with Katla (another reckless, not so smart character) and he stupidly didn't even think about what he was doing when he tried to spend all of the mercenaries money at the slave market where Katla was being sold. He didnt even stop to think that they could do something else, and he could have blown his cover and gotten himself in deep trouble. It was very very frustating to read about these charecters stupid mistakes that i dont think anyone of his age would make. Even 15 year olds could make better decsicions in those situations. All in all, this book was a dissapointment to the previous two and I was upset that this happened 
 I was going to wait until I finished reading this book to review it - seeing as how I still have 100 pages to go - but I'm not sure if I'll be able to ever finish it.  The book spends A LOT of time telling you the back story about how certain achievements were made in the field of science, but when it finally comes time to report the results of those achievements, the reader is only partially satisfied.  Very little actual science, and a lot of biographical information.  I was hoping it would be the other way around.  If you're interested in reading biographies of scientists you've probably never heard of, this is definitely the book for you.  Why would I give a book I didn't finish 2 stars?  Because I did pick up a few interesting mathematical tidbits from the sections I read.  I just didn't pick up enough tidbits to keep me going.  The universal constant is interesting, and the cross section of the chaotic 3-D graph is interesting too.  Great for scientific history buffs, but those looking for application for personal use, forget it 
 Should have been titled: "The God Particle - Pg. 366-376"  The book speaks very little about the Higgs boson for which it is named after.  Instead Lederman focusses on the idea of the unsplittable 'a-tom'.  Lederman goes through 'a-tom' history from the early Greek philosophers to the year 1993.    Here are some quick thoughts on the book itself:   (1) As to be expected, the book is a tad bit outdated.   Since 1993 the top quark has been found and the SSC has been cancelled (which is unfortunate since he had so much hope for it throughout the book, oops!).   (2) The book has its humor but I would not call it side-splitting.  I found it somewhat irritating that he often jumped to a side-story just to tell a joke.   (3) An earlier reviewer said it contained "dense math" though the only few equations that are in the book are to show what people put on t-shirts or to show that the symbol 'M' is different from 'm' which he explains anyway.  Any particle decay 'equations' are to be taken as givens for the reader. (4) The history is decent.  The book was worth reading, though I am not sure who it was written for.  On one hand, people looking for information on the Higgs would not wish to read the majority of this book's content.  On the other hand, people looking for history on the idea of an 'a-tom' would not pick a book called "The God Particle".  
 Ordred Feb 25th, recieved a broken one soon after.  I returned it right after and now its the middle of April and it is still not here.  If you live in Wisconsin they are $15.99 at a pick n' save.  I give up!  I have bought several things from Amazon and still have yet to recieve them or find out shipping info.  I have better things to do with my money. I will now shop somewhere else!!!! 
 Full of outdated advice such as putting baby to sleep on his stomach, scheduling feedings and leaving a newborn to "cry it out." Also focuses on the worst experiences of new mothers. It's important for struggling new mothers to know that they are not alone in their doubts, fears and resentments, but I found it very disheartening to read about these mothers (and fathers) who fantasize about escaping the demands of motherhood by "accidentally" dropping or drowning the baby and who resent, dislike and ignore (that is, neglect) their newborns. I recommend either The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two / by William and Martha Sears or Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5 / by American Academy Of Pediatrics instead 
 I am disappointed in this cookbook.  I have a hardbound copy that has fallen apart and only wanted to replace it.  The format is strange, a number of my favorite recipes are not in this 'newer' edition.  I also thought the spiral bound book would wear better then the hardbound, but it is difficult to turn pages and without the tabs finding what you're looking for is difficult.  Wish I had gotten the anniversary edition 
 This is gettin' serious ya'll. Music is turning into self-obsessed pointless over-hyped bull. Come on, ya'll are way smarter than to spend your hard-earned money on a whiny guy singin' about needin' a girl, who cares? Why listen to some bozo talkin' about him bein' #1? Why listen to a song about booty? Why listen to a song about smokin'? Why listen to a song about bling bling, hot cars, hot women, and $, when u could listen to something with a little more meaning. Please reconsider before spendin' your $ on Hip Hop Hits 6 
 This was the worst darn book I ever read.  I read it last year and never want to read it again.  It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food "food of the gods."  Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book.  It was terrible.  I hated it.  If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!! 
 I thought this book would be a page turner because of my previous experience with medical novels. It was anything but. The characters names and who they represented were too numerous and too confusing to remember.  There was more trite dialog than was necessary and very little medical plot early in the novel for my taste. Don't waste your time or money 
 I agree with the people who have said this workbook is a waste of money.  If you own the book, you don't need the workbook.  Enough said 
 Enough already!  This movie was a mess when it was released and it remains a mess.  De Palma is a much better director then this so all I can imagne is that he was under considerable pressure from the studio to bring it in under a certain time limit.  Please, movie gods, whereever you are, how about a director's cut so we can see what De Palma could really do with this.  
 I received this player as a gift, and although I tried to not be too judgmental, the first view of the player was nothing other than repulsive. The minute you see the player the first thing that draws your attention is not, in fact, the screen, but rather, the large thick black bar that houses the speakers directly under the screen. These speakers are so awkwardly placed, they make the average screen size seem even smaller than it would if the speakers were placed somewhere more aesthetically pleasing. After turning it on for a test, another thing that bothered me was the extremely obnoxiously whirring the player makes whenever it plays anything. It overpowers and distracts from the volume of movies or music and makes it hard to concentrate, much like the white noise you hear when wearing headphones on an airplane. The player, although covered in a sleek metal, is actually quite flimsy and my personal screen was quite loose. Overall, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend this piece of garbage for ANYONE. Save your money for something that's worth it. 
 Oh my gosh this book is sooooo wordy. It's 800 pages long, yet it probably could be condensed to less than 600, all without the loss of clarity. The authors explain everything to an excruciating degree, and often times things are repeated over and over again. For example, on page 194, a sentence reads:  "Web servers typically spawn a new process or create a new thread for each new client connection".  And then, only two sentences later, the authors write:  "Web servers often use only one process, but create a new thread with a new connection socket for each new client connection"  I'm not saying that this book should be written so as to be as precise as good code, but oh my gosh, spare us the overbearing details. Just give us the facts, please, and dispense with the jargon 
 my friends and i just chose this for our monthly fashion-oriented book club (we've previously enjoyed easily appropriate selections like "the devil wears prada", etc.) and were unanimously disapointed (they all are about to write their own reviews here, though).  maybe this could be good for someone who isn't already a Kate fan, or has never heard such things about models doing drugs or being too skinny - like people who live in a bio-sphere or something.  i guess i just expected more indepth info - like, how about a FREAKIN' INTERVIEW WITH KATE HERSELF! - from an author who ran "the web's most popular Kate Moss site" for like 5 years.  some "fan" 
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 Charles Bronson is one of my favorites, but VIOLENT CITY is example of 70's trash at it's worst. Boring slow pacing and a "see-saw" action that gets old really fast. Bronson's character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself.  I love Charles Bronson... but this is one of his dud films  
 The reader didn't read my 2G MiniSD. I have another reader that does so I dumped the MobileMate and took the lost 
 This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally 
 Why do I feel like the serpent in the Garden of Eden?... Sorry, I really liked "Deep Waters", but I probably won't buy another JAK unless I am stuck at an airport and I have read every other available Romance, Mystery or Thriller on the newsstand.  I think I have made myself clear.  It is time for me to find some new talented authors.  Although I know I have some previously read titles of hers to review.  Hopefully, they are better than this 
 Where's a good mage war when you need one? While Mr. Greenwood is a master of describing the intricacies of spell battles, his skills at characters development and human interaction are tragically underdeveloped. One gets the impression that every heroic character in his works has the same sophomoric, sarcastic sense of humor; the same selfless devotion to good causes (usually without any motivation); and the same overly sexualized past (read his books and you'll see what I mean) without any real follow-through in the present-day. The villains are even worse. I had to force myself to finish this book (nee trilogy) because I paid good money for it and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't. Overall, this was a sadly disappointing work from an icon of game design. Please focus more on your strengths, Mr. Greenwood 
 Even a pre-University chap could debunk that book.  It is right in what it defends but wrong in the way it does it.  Flawed methodolgy is Frame's Aquiles heel 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 I couldnt find this item ANY where but Amazon.Its all my Grandson wanted. I asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it- He said" I dont like it" I asked why, they arent cheep- He said " It doesnt soot far enough" ( OH! & Dylan is 7 yrs. old)    Hope this helps 
 I was pretty excited when I saw this book, but it was quite a let down when I received it. Over half of the book deals with science-fiction instead of fantasy and it also includes lots of computer made art. The best  artists of the fantasy art world were left out. There are some interesting  pieces in this book, but it was not really what I was hoping for 
 i can't believe that they got money to make this "movie"(i use that term loosly). the plot has more holes than you can count and the worst excuse for a reason to start a killing spree that i have ever seen. not even worth the price of a rental. just long and slow. you have been warned 
 I really liked the book from the begging I got hooked and could not stop reading. I loved the part with the missinaries and there triels and tribulations. We see how the missionaries tried tyo change Hawaii's customs on the people and we sew the down fall of the missionaries. But after that the book draged on and lost it's touch. It went on and on and on and only a few other things I enjoyed. i laos enjoyed the leaper partsd and the trials and tribulations of the chinese and Japense people. the problem here is that the auther gose on and on about pointless stuff we will soon forget. This novle could easly of been 500 pages but it's over 1000. I was dissapointed but it wasent entirley a bad book it was enjoyanle at times 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.    Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is "preserve the Aryan race."  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.  Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.    They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.    In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 It is very easy to install the sender, but the picture quality is really low.  Most of time you get the interference from other wireless objects like mobile phone, 900MHZ cordless phones, etc.  Will not recommend to buy for the once who are looking for good quality picture and sound transfer 
 Warning!! Talbott and Cynaumon are con artists! Corti-Slim is utterly worhtless.  Do Not waste your money. 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
 I am so disappointed in this book.  She was going along so good in the first two and to end this series with a dud.    The first problem was that she spent way too much time "explaining how psychic powers work or don't work"  I was to the point of wanting to skip pages to get back to the "story".    The second problem Hollis Templeton (from the first book) should have either been used more or not at all. Her part in this book was under done.  She did not really use her "gift/curse" to any satisfying outcome.  Wasn't our herione in this book supposed to help Hollis cope when she see's dead people.  Well, she was no help-might as well left the whole thing out.  And making our hero psychic too!  Yikes-Too Much!  The only positive thing was: I completely was way off base with who the killer was.  Totally took me by surpise.  It's ashame that the read to get there was so disappointing.    I look forward to Kay Hoopers next series and only hope she doens't bog herself down with "explaining" the abilites too much.  Leave the mystery in their abilities too 
 I purchased this book while planning a Tea Party.  The statement "15 seasonal Tea Parties" on the front of the book is misrepresentative of the actual contents.  This book is focused more on the art of Tea drinking and Relaxation techniques and suggestions than directions on how to conduct a Tea Party.  The back cover of the book is more properly representative when it states "you'll find the perfect way to enjoy the moment".  It is a Zen Tea focus, not serve 20 people Tea and Crumpets for your mother's birthday focus 
 after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown 
 Jo-Ellan Dimitrius has written a HORRIBLE book. Do not buy this goofy junk.  Only buy it if you like killers walking around free and  killing your children. 
 If you're looking for an accurate hygrometer, this isn't it! it was 15 points off when I tested it for accuracy! Amazon is taking back as defective so, i'm glad I bought it at Amazon 
 This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power. That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair 
 Robert Anton Wilson is sort of like the Howard Stern of the New Age movement. I'll give him this, he's entertaining. This book however, gets a resounding 'piece of crap' rating. It's a great book of fun little facts, but completely lacks any unifying theme (despite what you'd think), and Wilson degenerates all too often into one of his pat rants. This guy's getting old, and he apparently needs money, because he's cranking out high-volume and low quality lately, and re-issuing danged near everything. It's incredibly interesting (as a synthesis of facts already known to me and avid RAW Readers) in the first few chapters, but then meanders like the mind of a septagenarian, life-long potsmoker (oh wait, that's what Wilson *is*!!), on his deathbed. It gets into 15 year old news (the Manhattan Beach Satanic child abuse case(s)....ummmm...Why!?), 'Seeing-is-not-knowing' General Semantics that Wilson is wellknown for and 'map is not the territory' etc...all of which have *what* to do with a neo/quasi-fascist conspiracy financed by Dutch-English-American banker/extant blueblood families that have subverted the American Constitution? Well, I don't friggin' know either, but my guess is that the answer is 'nothing' and Wilson needed to put out a book. There's this whole reciprocally fellative network that I've noticed with these 'new agers' cross-endorsing their latest project and the New Falcon Press is a particularly egregious case of this phenomenon (in fact, in some occult bookstores, the genre, yes the *genre* is listed as Wilson-Hyatt- hahahahahahahaha) 
 If you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house, have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account, this book will seem extremely basic. There aren't really any tools, worksheets or practical plans here. The book is simply a series of "Tips" -- very brief articles from different financial planners. It's a readable format, but there's not much meat.  For example, the section on "Software for Staying Organized" includes mention of only 3 software products, two of which are Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken. The author starts her comments saying "The basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software" (My experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools).    If you're just starting out or really need a primer, this is a readable book and comes well recommended. But if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies, you'll find this too simple 
 The episodes are great! And so it is disappointing as [censored] that WB don't put the episodes out in the right order - which have the consequence of messing up a story arc. It takes so little research to put the episodes in the right order, and it means so much to fans of the series, that it is UNFORGIVABLE ... hence my one star. (I just can't believe it can happen. I thought WB was a giant cooperation with concerns about their image, instead it seems that WB are as infantile as Bugs Bunny, whom I personally outgrew at the age of 3 seconds. If I give WB too less credit, then they must have done the mix-up of episodes on purpose - making it more rational for people in the near future to buy this product AGAIN in high def without the mix-up. So what are you WB? Babys or evil masterminds?)  I'm sorry to create a bad atmosphere, when people, looking at this title, probably just want to read some positive comments, to get excited, when looking forward to buying it (I do, when browsing products), but I believe it is even more dissapointing to discover the episode mix-up on the dvds unwarned, and I just had to get my dissapointment of WB out in the world 
 I will admit that the story moved so slowly that I almost gave up on finishing the book.  The similarity between how the two young men died had me stopping to think, "okay, which one is she talking about now?"  I found it a bit confusing.  While I "almost" gave up on the book, I'm glad I didn't because I at least learned what a Chinese Partnership is!  I had never heard of that.    I think Ms. Monroe very accurately portrayed the southern way of life and the uneasy relationship between blacks and whites even when both races are trying to reach out to each other.    She also used the character of Adele to very ably show how greed can take precedence over family ties.  Adele justified her behavior by saying that her mother had always promised that the family home would be hers and then when her parents died everything was left to Adele's brother.  I can understand her frustration in this because knowing my love of reading my father had always told me that he wanted me to have his books.  Now there was no great monetary value to these books.  Their value was strictly sentimental; however, I very much wanted to have them because they had belonged to my father.  Unfortunately, he did not put anything about the books in his will and when my parents died, my older brother came in and scooped the books up and took them all.  I saw another similarity between Adele and my brother because it seemed that the accumulation of money was the most important thing in both of their lives.  I guess I am glad I read this book but it is not one I will keep because I cannot imagine myself ever plodding my way through it again.   
 I just recently got Abrazame Muy Fuerte and was disapointed I heard about it. They said Helena Rojo was in it since Im a big fan I though ok I'll get it and watch it well when I started to watch it's like wait where is she. never again will I do that Im hoping to catch it where she is in it did they cut her out or something. If anyone knows where I can find her init let me know. You can even e-mail me at [...]  Thanks                                                         Michelle  I gave it a 1 star 
 Only read the first chapter... Sorry. As people criticize China without being there, I guess I have the right to criticize this book without reading it entirely. So I guess this is just another book about how China wants to conquer the world. Unfortunately, this is not the only one. Let's review the first chapter very quickly. It is beginning with US-(NATO) bombing of China's ambassy in 1999...Mmmmh...Let me see... Where is the threat ? Ah and China was focusing its anger against US through their media (May be a Chinese Foxnews?). Really strange these Chinese people. Then it continues with the China's Communist plan where we have details about how US is spying China's airwaves.   I am wondering if the author has ever been to China or if he only relies on "intelligence" reports ? (May the same guys that found WMD in Irak ?).Unfortunately, this book is not available in eBook version, it seemed pretty funny 
 It's hard for me to believe that Janet had anything to do with this, other than her name. This is REALLY bad writing -- nothing like the Plum series. Janet did Charlotte Hughes a big favor by lending her name to it -- that's what I think. The dialogue is very contrived -- a whole different style from the great dialogue in the Plum series. I read the whole book, hoping it'd get better. It never did 
 This toaster was not up to snuff for a variety of reasons. It did not toast bread evenly; the toast was dark on top but virtually untoasted on the bottom. Secondly, it had a bagel feature which left the bagels very light when bagels should be very dark. Despite these deficiencies, the product did have one redeeming feature. The handle that allowed one to lift the toast out of the toaster to varying heights was very handy and unique compared to many other toasters. 
 This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work "Purple Cane Road" read by Will Patton.  
 Were all the reviews written by the author? Give me a break! The fact that every review sounds the same will keep me from ever purchasing this book. In that case, I guess all the reviews helped 
 This book was written with the idea of promoting the author's own product line. Sad, because otherwise it is a well written book backed with a good clinical background. If you can get over her commercial intention it is an ok read 
 By reading all of the other reviews I thought that this book would be right up my alley, and the actual story line was, but the execution of the story really lacks something.  I felt no real connection to the characters, and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further.  It's not that I disliked the book - it's that it didn't stirred my emotions at all.  I felt that it was a waste of time 
 Ah, another book from good old Sylvia Browne, the woman who, a few weeks ago on a TV show in effect told a woman who described waking up unable to breathe and feeling panic and sickness, "Aw, forget it, honey, that was just you trying to astral project." Gee, Sylvia, maybe a recommendation that anyone waking up breathless and ill might want to see  a doctor? Ya think?  Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest.  Nothing new here in this book, although she acts like it's revolutionary material. Sutphen, Fiore and others were writing about cellular memory and the supposed past life roots of present-day ills more than thirty years ago, and Ruth Montgomery was telling of it in the 1960's.   Once again, Browne left me unimpressed and whatsmore:  (Page 101) Browne describes a woman burned for witchcraft at "Salem."   Fact: NO ONE WAS BURNED FOR WITCHCRAFT AT SALEM.  (Page 96) Woman shot in "early 1500's India" when her assailant withdrew a "gun" from under her skirt, and killed her.   Fact: Although firearms were not unknown on the Indian subcontinent in the period described, they were rare in the extreme, new technology unlikely to be in the hands of any but a handful of military personnel, and were far too large to easily be concealed under a skirt. Furthermore, it's unlikely a woman, or even many men, would have been capable of firing the guns of the period, as the violent explosions and recoil were difficult to restrain and frequently presented great danger to the shooter.  (Page 113) A man describes living on a "horse ranch" in South Carolina.   Fact: A "ranch" in South Carolina? I don't think "ranch" would have been a word a real person from that time and place would have employed to describe his property.  (Page 176) In a reported past life, a patient tells of being a doctor named "Morgan" who lived in New England in 1923 who was arrested for the violent murder of his wife.  Fact: One would suspect such a sensational crime would be front page news and yet from what I have been able to tell, no such event as a physician named Morgan being accused of spousal murder is recorded as having taken place in New England during the 1920's.  And this book hit number one on the best seller lists? How long is Sylvia Browne going to be able to pull this off, folks?  In closing, let me let you in on a little secret about "psychics." They are actually worse off than you when it comes to  wondering what happens to us when we die. You and I can openly admit we don't know, but they have to pretend they have all the answers even though they don't. Their lot is to spend their lifetimes longing for the same answers as you and I: they just don't get to ask the questions

 I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro.  I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger.  With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display.  Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep.  With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it.  Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.  I guess I got what I paid for.  A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30.  I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port "hockey puck" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs.  No problems with those 
 Perhaps this book should have been titled My Life Raising Bettas to Sell to Pet Shops.  It is more interesting as autobiography than a reference.  There are only seven pages of basic betta care.  The majority of the chapters are related to breeding and raising bettas for a pet shop market.  The section on fin forms and colors and color variations would make a handy basic reference---if it had pictures to illustrate the descriptions.  It does have a lot of color pictures and the captions provide some of the most concise and interesting information.  If you have an interest in economical fish raising and selling, this book has information for you.  Don't buy it as your basic reference, do buy it for the pictures 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 This book is hispanocentric postmodern ethnic metropolitan pre-racist Asiatic multipentagonocentric Euro-postmodernist and Afro-American postethnic rurulian native urbanistic social post-minority sludge.  In other words, gibberish 
 Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.   
 These recipes may be simple, but they are not ingredients that one would find at the local grocery store. I purchaced this cook book because I thought that it would be simple and "every-day" user friendly;not so simple.  
 Really a total mis-mash of bewildering essays from the mid 70s this collection mirrors the typical anti-Americanism of the era.  The essays are called `bold' but the reality is that disagreeing with the Vietnam war isn't exactly revolutionary.  No original thought is found within these essays instead they are the typical `America is evil' mentality.  One essay in particular focuses on the war in Laos and Cambodia but it ignores the Vietnamese invasions of these countries and the destabilizing influence that Vietnamese troops caused as they rampaged through the rice fields of Cambodia in order to invade South Vietnam.  The reality is that these essays completely ignore and in fact deny the truth about Pol Pots regime in Cambodia, a communist regime that killed 25% of the country and especially murdered minority groups and Muslims.  These glaring anti-factuals make this collection hard to accept and even harder to digest.  Fans of the authors previous work will be delighted, while most will be unhappy 
 This book is so lightweight it could float. Read UNCLE MAX by this author and found it fresh, funny and innovative.  Well Mr. Kenry has certainly made a downward spiral with this so called novel after such great promise. The book has absolutely no in-depth characterizations, the story is totally unreal .  The book is just very amateurish.  There is some excellent gay fiction out there by some very talented writers.  This book is not one of them.  I honestly couldn't finish it.  One of the worst I've ever read. Just trying to help some of you not waste your time 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.

 banal, derivative, overproduced tripe.  whiney, lame, stupid vox/lyrics. a country-inflected KILLERS--i.e. soul-less corporate rock gone trendy (read "alt-country" wannabes with My Bloody Valentine fantasies).    Sub Pop, whence the spate of horribly BORING records.  i've not bothered to list song tracks cause they're really undeniably samey, these songs--one after an irksome other.  don't waste money--buy GOOD RECORDS:  yo la tengo, sparklehorse, the black watch, the radio dept.  all put out excellent albums this year.  investigate 
 I bought this DVD based on reviews here on Amazon. I won't fault others for thier position, it's just a matter of personal taste. For me this was a big disapointment. The story leaves a lot to be desired. The character Walker (Lee Marvin) gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn't have. The direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different, but it failed. I'm sorry I bought this DVD 
 This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with "Substance" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on 
 Having participated in an academic exchange with a school in England, I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend who also had a similar experience. I was anticipating something quite different from what I read. Although I found the general story line familiar and amusing, I did not care for the overall work. The book will have little meaning to a reader unless (a) you were either a student or teaching during the 60's or (b) you actually participated in a teaching exchange preferably in the UK 
 I was reading the other reviews and wondered if I was reading the same book.  I even checked the cover to make sure.  Yep, I read the same book but didn't get the same information out of it than other people had.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the other reviews were from Ryan Allis' mother, neighbors, and friends just to boost the book's credibility.  Here's the deal:  I've actually built and sold my company and didn't do it the way Ryan Allis suggested.  Not even close.  Okay, so maybe he has a different method, right?  I just don't see how it's possible to build a company the way he outlines, then to sell it?  I think that he's trying to cover way too much information in this book.  That's the first problem.  The second problem is this:  He tries to "fluff out" the book by adding extraneous information like "globalization" and why there was the "dot bomb crash" in the late 90s.  WHO CARES?  It's like he purposely adds useless information to either make himself seem more intelligent, confuse his readers, mask that he doesn't know what he's talking about or add pages to what would otherwise be a 50-page book.  Another issue I have is that he has his readers do an "opportunity recognition and evaluation" of a company that they would like to start.  Such companies he was able to "brainstorm" are making oxygen tanks so dogs and cats can go diving, flavored straws, sonar for blind people, a teddy bear with sensors and small computer inside that would talk to infants/toddlers and encourage good behavior or tell them a bedtime story (then what are parents for?), restaurants for dogs and cats and a variety of other SUPER LAME business ideas.  I have a lot of business experience under my belt and, if you are considering starting a business, here's my advice:  Don't reinvent the wheel.  Take a concept that someone else is doing very successfully, add your own twist to it, and your product or service through direct response (direct mail, Internet, etc.).  And that's it.  What's with the oxygen tanks for dogs and cats so they can go diving?  Is this guy out of his [CENSORED] mind?  I love my pets too much to subject them to something that would freak them out like underwater diving.  And doesn't he know that cats HATE THE WATER?  This is precisely why I like the book Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen so much.  He gives the BEST business ideas with actual step-by-step plans to go with it.  No guessing, reinventing the wheel, inventing some lame-brain product that is destined to fail, and pushing people in the wrong business direction.  If you are thinking of starting a business, don't buy this book.  If you have a business and would like to sell it, don't buy this book.  In fact, I can't think of ANY reason to buy this book 
 ugh.  as a confessed bibliophile, i honestly try to give every single book its due.  but this one was impossible...poetic, but impossible.  barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch.  unless you eat, breath and sleep xylem and phloem, don't waste time trying to pad through this book 
 I really enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network, and the other recipes of his that I've tried from the Food Network website have turned out well. However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding. Thus, I'm wary of trying another recipe in the book, but if I do, I'll be a lot less blindly trusting 
 Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of "Until I Find You." Absolutely check out "The World According to Garp, "A Prayer For Owen Meany, or "Cider House Rules." Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters.  This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy 
 The idiots have struck again!  Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen..are they all insane?!!! If I hadn't opened it, I would return it to amazon now! A flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way. The directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools!  Don't buy it 
 Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time. 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 This tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill.. it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1/2 inch too narrow.  This causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported.  The tools have a very "cheap" feel to them. The tongs were the worst.. the handles are loose and they are prety much useless.  The knife won't hold an edge.  The spatula and tongs are marginal.  I would not recommend this item 
 I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2. 
 ...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera 
 This album marks a huge change in style from the type of music we all got to know Deep Forest for making.    This album sounds like something you'd here backing the soundtrack of the TV show "Ripley's Believe It Or Not...!" or the music played on some NBC special featuring a Las Vegas magician while performing some trick.  I think I even catch an air of the TV show "Survivor's" voting torch ceremony music.  Basically, it sounds like mediocre studio music made by people who are just trying to cash their check.  I've had few albums that have disapointed me as much as this one did.  Avoid it, find a new artist that cares about quality, because obviously the people behind Deep Forest just want the record company to cut them a check when they finish an album 
 Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?    With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.    Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find "money people".     If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.    True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other "real estate riches" type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores 
 This book is grossly deficient because it does not emphasize the Jewish guilt in killing Jesus Christ enough.  Jesus Christ was persecuted by Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians -- Jewish religious leaders of the time who worked together with the Jewish court (King Herod was a Jewish king!) to pass a death penalty against Jesus Christ in the Jewish High Court (Sanhedrin).  To ignore the suffering of Jesus Christ at the hands of Jews is to minimize the suffering of Christ.  How can you understand grace when you don't understand what Jesus Christ had to go through.  I would recommend reading of the Gospels carefully -- they give ample account of Jewish persecution against Christ.  This writer should follow the example of Gospel writers 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 i bought this product about a month or two ago. and i still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use. THis product seems  to be a lot harder unless it's the wrong data cable which it shouldn't be since it's advertised as an EnV data cable 
 So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious.  Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit 
 This is a horrible book that presents a lot of scattered topics but fails to bound them together. It has a lot of ultra long math formulas on every pages with very brief explainations. The little explaination is done by refering to other abstract formulas which are on other pages! It is totally unreadable and may be it is intended to be a reference book only 
 I can't beleive how utterly desgusted i was. this story was awful. The plot of course is nice like always because it Pirates of th Carribean but the book is so easy to read and not written very well.    I'de just stick to the movie.  Nothing against the Pirates of the Carribean in general. It was the perfect thing to read if you missed the movie and was just catching up to find out what's going on but the book just deffinitly wasnt worth it at all otherwise 
 Chet Baker certainly does have his apologists.  Phrases such as, "He can't sing, but ..." are repeated like mantras.  Fact is, he just plain can't sing.  He has a sort of hipper-than-thou whisper that broadcasts, "I'm such a sensitive artiste."  For some reason, people bought it.  Blame it on the good looks, the smack habit, the James Dean act, and the times, which glorified everything unstudied and done badly - (read Kerouac).  He was a nice, if unremarkable, horn man.  But that singing, wow.  You'll get more passion from your dishwasher, and more technique too.  Baker's real brilliance was in passing off attitude for art, something that survives to this day.  He was at the avante garde of being a poseur.      
 This is just one more Hilter book that quotes the lies of earlier Hitler books.  Hitler was no prince and the Nazis were not the boy scouts, but if you take a balanced look at history, they were not "the worst of the worst" and Hitler as not "evil incarnate".  Irving's books contain detailed footnotes. He got to know people the other historians wouldn't seek out, he found documents that others ignored and, he came to conclusions, based on his research, that others didn't want to hear.  If you just read the introduction to "Hitler's War" you can see that Irving is not whitewashing Hitler or the Nazis.  The idea of discrediting the messenger in order to discredit the message explains exactly what it happening to Irving and others like him who are attempting to correct the historical record.  History is written by the victors and you can go back 2,000 years or more and find that "official" stories are often biased or outright lies.  If you want to reread the lies, read Evans; if you want the truth, read Irving 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 This book was entertaining, but... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of "inappropriate elimination" (peeing/pooping in the wrong place), even though the author himself describes it as "the number one behavior problem".  He says "No other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia".  I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic???  The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).  Throughout the book, I wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions 
 As one other reviewer notes, it's incredibly poorly written. The info is not new, not helpful, not... well, let's just say I saw it a conventional (offline, independent) bookstore, thought it was a cute title, and, being as short on time that day as I almost always am short on sleep, I didn't leaf through it before buying it. MISTAKE!   I really resented paying money for this piece of self-congratulatory-ness. I'm glad the author found something that worked for him, I'm glad he suffered and then interrupted the cycle: hooray for anyone who does that, in any area of life. But it sure didn't do anything for me, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.   Aggravating waste of trees.  
 As a new mother, this book disturbed me. The "author" writes about her own experiences as if they are facts that ALL mothers are HONESTLY experiencing (and if they don't admit it then they are just lying and she doesn't trust them). I have no problem with people writing about their personal experiences and I certainly don't have to agree with their views; in fact, whether I agree with Wilder-Taylor is irrelevant. The problem I have is that she writes as if she is the authority over issues that she has only experienced first-hand. She uses a lot of, "you will feel..."  "This will happen to you..." It's ironic because she writes at length about how she hates it when people tell her what to do or how to feel and yet that's what she does to her readers.  She also over-simplifies just about everything she writes about and doesn't give factual information. For example, in her breastfeeding section she gives only 2 extreme scenarios: If you choose to breastfeed and are eventually successful at it then you are a breastfeeding nazi or you're a sane person who realizes formula is best (mothers I know don't fall into either extreme camp). Again - it's fine to share one's personal experience, but she attempts to give factual information and even brings in her own expert to back herself up. For example, she says that her pediatrician has not seen any differences between breastfed babies and formula fed babies in his practice. Ok, either she's lying or he lied to her. All one has to do is read statements based on years of research from the World Health Organization or the American Academy of Pediatrics to see that this is simply not statistically sound (you don't need a college degree or even a high school diploma to understand this).  I know how excruciatingly painful and difficult breastfeeding is for many women (including myself). I know mothers, for a variety of reasons, who exclusively breastfeed, exclusively use formula, and breastfeed and supplement with formula. I do not judge women for their decisions as she clearly does which again is ironic as she's doing the same thing to her readers as she feels the lactation consultants, doula, La Leche League volunteers and complete strangers have done to her.   In her chapter on "little braniacs" she writes, "if you're dying for your child to speak Chinese, why not adopt a Chinese kid? The upside is in a few years they can do your taxes. On the other hand, they'll cost you a bundle in car insurance." Not only is this not funny, but it's extremely ignorant. She says a lot of things like this in her book which readers might interpret as "real" and "so hilarious" but why does one have to say, quite frankly "mean" things at the expense of others and others' choices? This has nothing to do with being "PC" at all, by the way. I simply think it's unfortunate when people need to make fun of other people to make themselves feel better.    I believe that new mothers need to support one another (as she also says she believes, strangely enough). I also like it when new mothers are willing to admit that they are not perfect and it's refreshing when we can laugh at ourselves. Though Wilder-Taylor claims to do all of this, she actually just judges other new mothers and their decisions as well as puts them into 1 extreme camp or another in virtually every page. I felt like I was in high school again reading a book written from one of the "mean", not-so-bright girls, but I'll stop here. I don't want to stoop down to Wilder-Taylor's level 
 I was disappointed in this book first by the quality of the binding.  By the end of the book I had a half dozen loose pages falling out from the low quaity of the binding.    My second disappointment was the actual content.  The case studies appeared as 5th generation photo-copies and were barely readable.  The writing style was rambling and didn't bring much of anything useful to light until near the book's end.  Overall, a near waste of reading time 
 At first, I thought I was crazy when I couldn't get into this book, but found that others felt similarly.  I couldn't get into it!  Danielle Steele described the characters' feelings with the same words & emotions throughout the entire novel!  All it seemed like was that Kate aged biologically, but not emotionally.  At one point in the story, I was getting really annoyed at her for sounding like a nagging wife (though her concerns seemed semi-legit).  Don't we have enough "nagging wives" across America?  I really couldn't like Joe the way I could "like" other characters from Ms. Steele's other novels, probably because he admitted first and foremost that airplanes were his first true love.  Yes, there are many men like that out there, but Danielle Steele novels are supposed to be an escape - and aren't supposed to be thinly veiled portrait of some man we all knew.. 
 I rented the "original" Star Wars first, just to see if it was as bad as everyone says.  Good GOD!  It's horrible!  It looks only slightly better than video tape.  I read a lot of reviews stating that "this is what fans have ask for"...honestly, I didn't ask for this.  Nobody did.  Sure we all want the choice between the original Star Wars and the Special Edition, but I think George is doing nothing but slapping us fans in the face with this release. I despertly wanted the original movies in their original form, but not like this.  I think George is basically trying to get us to admit that his special edition is better....it's not.  The way it was presented on DVD is far superior, but in my opinion, George is taking away part of our childhood with the new stuff.  for example, they remastered Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, but did they ad new characters?  Change the songs to something more "current"?  Digitally enhance Atlanta burning? No....but they did do those transfer justice.  They look great, they sound great, and that makes for fun viewing.  This slop that George is handing us is NOT what we asked for....so George, I say to you...NO!  BAD!  If I had a rolled up newspaper, I smack you in the head with it and rub your nose this pile of....DVD's...to make sure you know better next time.  When these films get remastered again for HI-DEF, I'll buy...IF he gives us what WE want 
 When a historian deliberately sets out to idolize a conqueror, no matter how great, he or she has himself or herself to blame for being disbelieved.  I don't know any modern biographer of Alexander except William Tarn who took such a one-sided attitude to this man.  This book even claims that now an "accurate, balanced, and convincing" biographty is possible (implying you know which book meets this high standard).  I beg to differ.  It really bothers me when a historian refuses to face reality.  Though I am an admirer of the great king, I think Rogers's whole perspective is wrong.  He seems to think that Alexander did what he did in order to create a sort of commonwealth for all "sons of Zeus" - including the Persians, the Indians, etc. - all for their benefit.  Even worse, Rogers compares Alexander with Truman and Churchill, because Truman atomic bombed Japan and Churchill made a mistake in World War I which cost some innocent lives.  Leaving aside his comparison of Alexander with Mozart for the moment - he makes this comparison because Mozart also "disturbs our rest" - I don't see how a fair-minded person, let alone a historian, can say such things.  Had Japan not been atomic bombed, Japan would not have surrendered, and an invasion of mainland Japan had been estimated to cost a million GIs - dead - and who knows how many more Japanese lives?  As for Churchill, it is one thing to make a tactical error, but quite another to kill people as the aggressor.  It is clear that Rogers does not even care to look objective.  It is a wonder that he doesn't compare Alexander with George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Theresa.  The assertion, which Rogers repeatedly makes, that Alexander was no Hitler or Stalin is, on the face of it, quite correct.  But it that saying much for the blood-soaked invader?  Hitler and Stalin are quite plainly the worst mass-murderers in all history.  So I'm not sure what Rogers is really aiming to prove here, except that no comparison is too extreme for him to support that particular viewpoint which he holds.  Clearly, Alexander's homosexuality is something Rogers is uncomfortable with.  So he adds this bombshell after all the rationalizing: "Yet the umambiguous evidence that sex was central to their [Alexander with Hephaeistion] relationship is conspicuously absent."  One needs to be a lawyer to parse this sentence, but I can think of no easier way for a historian to weasel out of this fact about Alexander than such a precise statement.  You want to know what is "unambiguous evidence," what "central" means, and above all what Rogers means by "sex."  Robin Lane Fox and Peter Green certainly believed Alexander's relationship with Hephaeistion was sexual.  Paul Cartledge also.  Indeed most reputable biographers admitted as much.  Tarn, for obvious reasons, did not.  But then I suppose no amount of evidence would seem "unambiguous" enough for Rogers - short of a baby!  Even then Rogers would doubt such a baby would prove anything, DNA testing not yet available then to establish paternity.  Can I blame Rogers?  It wasn't so long ago that a well-known public figure claimed he didn't have a sexual relationship (just "an inappropriate relationship") with his intern because, as it turned out, he had defined "sex" as full intercourse only.  I suppose there are some things two men can't do with each other no matter how hard they try (like making a baby).  I hope you have an idea by now the premises from which Rogers attempts to argue throughout this book.  The trouble with Alexander is that there are different ways to look at the facts, and the facts themselves are often hard to come by.  Rogers's claim to "accuracy, balance, and conviction" is not as simple as the "ABC" which these words happen to stand for, when it comes to so elusive a figure.  The very ancient nature of the saga is a problem, for we must rely on the veracity and the resources of the ancient historians, like Arrian, who themselves wrote long after the events.  But it does startle me when a writer takes an interpretation which differs so much from the ones I know from the biographies written by A. R. Burn, Lane Fox, Green, Paul Cartledge (the recent addition) and especially A. B. Bosworth - all highly reputable historians of Alexander and specialists of ancient Greece.  I may be wrong, but I smell something fishy about this book.    
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 I found this book dissappointing.  It gives readers misinformation that can make symptoms of NLD worse, not better.  For example, the author encourages the readers to allow video/computer play stating it "builds eye-hand coordination".  Not only will this NOT develop eye-hand (that comes from anticipating a three dimensional object coming to you in space and manipulating the hands to accurately receive it" but fixation on computers often leads away from motor development and soical interaction.  We don't need more misinformatoin about NLD 
 I was reluctant to pick up this book because of it's title, but I decided to read it because I had it in my collection. I was somewhat entertained, and finished the book very quickly due to the short length. It is a tragedy in which almost all are killed in the end. I did not care much for the plot, which involves an incestuous relationship between brother and sister. After reading part of the book, it was rather easy to predict the ending. It is not a tremendously detailed and emotional story. I'm not sure if this is a title that would often come up in conversations between friends or colleagues, but avid readers might want to pick up the title to have read it 
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, US Defense Contractors were also on the verge of collapse, that is until someone had the bright idea of privatizing the government. Current government privatization efforts have resulted in huge contracts costing the American taxpayer double and triple the cost of the original government employees. This book is a Conservative Pipe Dream, a guide to a fantasy bureaucracy that never existed, and a bomb that has totally disrupted the efficient operation and security of the Federal Government 
 I read up to chapter twenty (about 300 pages) and stopped reading the book, realizing I had more important things to read.  My major complaints are (1) that there is too much discussion of the Mozart family finances, which I'm sure would be fascinating to economists and accountants, however tedious to someone concerned about music; and (2) too much retroactive Freudian analysis of the subject, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Think about this:  Solomon uses an obsolete, and now debunked, system of psychoanalysis to describe a subject that cannot be interviewed.  The best discussion of music is concerning the Salzburg serenade style in chapter eight.  Other than that brief section (pp. 125-133), I was not impressed.  Short of reading Mozart's letters and making your own analysis, I recommend Stanley Sadie's "Mozart: The Early Years, 1756-1781" for starters.    
 It is really just one poker player interviewing a bunch of other poker players - and it is not very well done.  There are a couple of good tips, but nothing I have not read elsewhere.  Save your money.  If you are a beginner, and want to learn how to play hold'em, check out Howard Lederer's 'Secrets of No Limit Hold'em' (DVD) and Phil Hellmuth's 'Play Poker Like the Pros' (book), more advanced players should check out David Sklansky's books 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 I am not a fan of Robert Kiyosaki.  I find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense.  While he introduces some worthwhile ideas, I don't think he develops them enough to be useful.  I also don't like the tone or context out of which this writer expresses himself.  I find that it comes across as unfeeling, manipulative and selfish.  I don't have anything against seeking out wealth; however, I think the means to that end is important.  In my opinion, this author ignores that important fact and at the same time does not supply the detail that people are looking for or need to achieve their financial goals.  In short, I think this book is a waste of money.  There are many other books that can give you more useful information in less space which is delivered from a more humane emotional space. 
 I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced "Logic Will Break Your Heart", although you would never know this by listening to "Without Feathers".  As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing "Logic Will Break Your Heart".  I fell in love with "Logic..", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up. After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging.  I thought, "Did I buy the wrong cd?  Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?"  But, to my dismay, it was The Stills.  Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt "Logic..." could be anything but disappointed in this album.  I've tried examining it from a different angle.  I've given it a "fresh listen".  Nothing.  I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace".  What happened to the magic, man? 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 I am a big fan of Seagal films, but I must say that this one is complete and total trash.  While it did have a mild plot, and some of the action scenes were pretty good, the inconsistencies ruined the movie.  I mean....come on.  Are we supposed to believe that when an F-16 targets an F-117, the targeting computer shows it as another F-16?  PUULEASE!  Hell, once, while the F-117 was in complete stealth mode (invisible), the outline turned into an F-16 in once scene.  HAHA!!  Come on now!!  Oh, but that isn't the best part.  This one is the best; the aircraft that take off from the carrier were two F-18 and two F-14 in the slate grey color scheme of naval aircraft, but when they are in the air and heading towards the target, they magically turned into F-16 aircraft sporting desert colors.  If you are looking for a good action film with even a mild plot, DON'T GET THIS ONE!  Get one of Seagal's other films.  This one is awful, and I'm upset that I spent the money to rent it.  Though, I'm glad I did rent it instead of buying it like I normally do with Seagal movies.  To quote 'Comic Book Guy', "Worst Film Ever!!" 
 This book is aboslutely worthless, unless you're totally clueless and have never ventured over 20 miles from your place of birth 
 I only wish I had taken jakasaur's review more seriously. Dont waste your money. It is not funny and not helpful 
 Comparing Oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the Vegas casinos of yesteryear and today.  The hippest casinos of that era were, by today's highest standards of casino elegance and class (no, I'm not talking about Excalibur), dull, smokey, hokey, and cramped - just like the original Oceans 11.  I'm as fascinated with the Rat Pack as much as anyone, but I think it's important to take the rose colored glasses off when critiquing the work of these sometimes neurotically insecure and deeply flawed individuals in order to judge a movie on its own merits.  I think too many peoples' sense of self identity is reflected in the image of the Rat Pack to ever really do objectivity justice.  Humor and style do evolve (my father, for example, finds no humor in some of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV today), so it's hard to compare two different eras.  Nevertheless, great, timeless cinema came out of this era, but this work is not in that category.  By any movie standards it drags heavily and its "hipness" seems contrived and forced into an otherwise hokey vibe. The musical interludes and final stride down the Strip are incredible for reinforcing this image (and I do love them as stand alone moments), but jar so completely with the tone and style of the rest of the movie that I can't help but think this was just a vanity flick to satiate the appetites of fans hungry to devour media images of the highest style and pizzaz that era had to offer.  Regarding the issue of whether this movie appeals only to an older generation, it should be noted that those in the younger generation who have reviewed this movie favorably are teenagers.  There may be something deeper at work here - an adolscent (or arrested adolesecent) quest for a two-dimensional, this-is-what-cool is mantra by fans of any age.  To me this movie is little more than a vain time capsule revealing how much tighter, interesting, and more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society at large has become.  That said, there's still an audience for the old school casino in which dank slot machines greet you at the door on the way to the cheap buffets, just as there is and always will be an audience that smugly holds this 1960s Ocean 11 as superior.  I know I'll take a hit in terms of "was this review helpful" points from this crowd, but by the nature of who they are they got away with a lot that would never compel an objective viewer free from the folklore enmeshed in this intriguing group's fame.  
 The title was the best part of this book.  Not worth purchasing - if you MUST read it check it out from the library or borrow it. Don't ask me for it - mine is headed for Goodwill because I can not stand to burn or trash a book. It was awful and vulgar.  Very disappointed. I hope someone else writes the book to fit the title.  Unfortunately I bought two books by the author and was disappointed with BOTH 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I seem to recall that the author of this "book" did a documentary that aired on PBS some years ago, which was not too bad. Not being able to find a video of the documentary, I looked forward to the 2nd edtion of the book. What a waste! Whoever indexed this thing must have been drunk at the time! Look up any entry in the index and almost none of the references are correct! e.g. "Swift, Wesley" refers you to pages 14, 15: but there's no mention of him on those two pages; "Rockwell, George Lincoln" refers you to page 21: no mention of Rockwell on that page, but there is a mention of Tom Metzger, whose listing in the index shows no reference to page 21!!! Beyond this, the book was written from the viewpoint of someone with the mindset of Hillary Clinton: not a very inviting alternative to individuals portrayed in the book 
 This is a quite corny adventure film, one of the least significant movies Hitchcock ever made.  It deserves the two stars by Maltin.  Yes, Charles Laughton is good as the major villain, although his makeup could have used some work at times, especially during closeups.  Yes, 19-year-old Maureen O'Hara is beautiful, even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming and her makeup never gets smeared.  Yes, young Robert Newton is okay, even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry and clear after being in the ocean.  But on the whole, this is a melodrama one can live without.  Young people especially will guffaw at the hammy ending.   A worse problem is the print.  It's inferior.  And at one point there is a jump that eliminates five or ten minutes of the story.  There is no excuse for putting this sort of print on DVD 
 Reviewer Santteresa was totally correct. This is another incoherent nightmare from a bad revisionist author with a good publicist. The author does his usual rewriting of history. He often ignores the sources we have, and reinterprets them along his own inane version of political correctness. On one page he makes the most bigoted and incorrect statement one could imagine. "He said that the blood of the Gauls who sacked Rome in 390bc proudly ran in his veins. First, that proves his dismissive attitude towards the builders of western civilization. Second, the Irish have NOTHING whatever in common with the "Italian Celts-Gauls who started the wars with the Roman Republic!" As for his New Age version of Christianity. "How could the author, or anyone else for that matter put themselves in the minds or hearts of the apostles Peter or Paul? PLEASE, don't waste your time or money 
 John Fairchild is the charismatic and outspoken publisher of two of the fashion industry's most influential magazines: Women's Wear Daily and W. Here he offers the ultimate insider's guide to today's fashion scene--a gossipy, no-holds-barred look at the world of the superstar designers and social climbers who buy their clothes.  It's actually a pretty boring book.  It was written in the 80's so it's really dated.  I wouldn't recommend this one, it's way too pretentious. 
 One of the best poker players of all time but one of the worst poker books of all time. Written for player that are new to poker and it has no real depth of substance in its poker theory. Reading this book will help a novice to better understand the game but will leave you a long way from "playing like a pro".   This is the way Phil wants you to play poker, so he beats you... 
 The leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing.  I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring.  I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings 
 This must be a joke. Writing yet another book on creativity that is simply a rehash of the original book with a slightly different twist. Not an example of creative thinking in my estimation. Don't waste your money 
 well, it says that rebecca ray left school at the age of 16 to write this book. you can tell. i read, way too much. i can usually get thorough anything. i couldnt get all the way through this book. it just kept dragging on and on...yeah, i really dont like this book and i think this is one of the worst ive read. 
 You can't help but be sad about this autobiography... but I couldn't tell if it was the story or the writing.  If you love books about random name dropping (without any real reason why) then this book is for you.  I was expecting a bit more substance but realized 1/4 through the book that all I was getting was a shallow story of how a young girl received every material item she'd ever want and searching to fullfil the longing for the 'mom' she never had.    All I ask if she give me some of her prescription meds to calm my anger of spending money on this garbage.  Save your money, time, and anger...this book has a good story, but the author completely misses on any anticipated moral takeaways that you are led to believe will surface 
 ...but I listen to them even less!  I bought this album at random a few years ago.  My first impression after I bought it was "mediocre British band".  I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed.  If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 This book reduces an important movement to a mere fad. I should have known better. What can a NY editor trapped in Manhattan know about real organic living? I was stupid to have bought this book in the first place 
 I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.  What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.  While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 I belive this book is just a little more them a book for dummies. I still don't think I picked the right book for me. I still feel like I am in the dark. 
 This is a terrible book.  This book claims to be a self-help book for people suffering from serious mental illness. However, the authors do not rely on any research to support the methods described in the book. Instead of relying on current research, the book seems to be based on principals of psychology that are outdated by a half a century.  Given the enormous advances in neuroscience in the last twenty years, one has to wonder why anyone would buy a book that ignores recent developments in the science of the brain.  It appears that the intent of this book is to attract the reader to the author's exorbitantly priced residential treatment center, since he suggests that you contact him there at both the beginning and end of the book.  In short, if you are looking for help with mental illness, you would be better served to find a book that discusses methods that have been proven to be effective in scientific studies instead of the nonsense contained in this book 
 Although this book does aim at covering all the options with dealing with the pain of labor, most of the options presented seem ineffective and / or unrealistic -- leaving the only "true" form of pain relief to be  medication, which is my goal to avoid.  Lots of stuffing, no meat 
 Back in the 70s, Ted petitioned a court for guardianship of a 14-year-old so he could have sex with her. He also admitted to "crapping" himself for a week straight to avoid the Vietnam draft? But he hunts! So he's a great guy 
 Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  "Till The Ends Meet" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is "Angry Eyes." The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer. 
 I have enjoyed previous financial books by Mr. Stein and his television appearances on financial programs as well as his appearance on Seinfeld.  Mr. Stein seems insightful, knowledgeable and personable.  However his self help book that I am reviewing now I found to be shallow in depth.  One cannot find happiness by deciding what you want  and obtaining it for the same reason a child only finds temporary pleasure in a new toy until he/she gets bored with it. Finding fulfillment in life is more complex and more meaningful than this book discusses.   I would probably be for Mr. Stein sticking to finance and comedy; self help is not his talent in the opinion of this reviwer 
 This book is too punny.  I think that if this book read more like the "Zombie Survival Guide", it would be much, much better. 
 I knew going in that this film got poor reviews.  It should have had a warning label regarding bad taste, poor parenting, and rude behavior.  This is alleged to be a "family" when in fact it was a collection of lazy, self-absorbed, monsters that should have been put in burlap bags and left on the door step of an evil witch.  The parents were completely ineffective and clueless on how to raise children much less organize such a large household.    This is the typical Hollywood view of families -- that is a family composed of loud mouthed rude children with a quick response to totally goofy parents.  Not one child uttered one believable line in the entire movie.  If ever a film warranted asking for your money back this one is it 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 I want my two hours back.  This film struggles to find an audience.  I cannot imagine that it will inspire anyone to join the military (at least the fictional one it portrays!).  Furthermore, it's message is utterly ambiguous- much less than what the veiwer deserves for putting up with its boorish crassness.  Skip this one 
 There is so much more to the imaginary London than the author conveys.  This book feels like it was dictated to complete an assignment.  Buy the Ackroyd book, London: A Biography instead...and then use your own imagination.  I agree with previous reviewers who called it superficial with the real book still waiting for an author to write it 
 What is Wilbur Smith's obsession with the word "escarpment"?!?!  (I stopped count at 37). That aside, this is a pretty hefty adventure.  It caught my eye in the bookstore- the premise of a grand search for an Egyptian tomb really grabbed my interest.  That being said- the author goes a bit overboard with character/scene details, making for a 650+ page read.  Not that it's a negative comment, just a concern about length- there's no economy of words when it comes to Wilbur Smith's writing style.  He's a good storyteller, but it could be so much better with the proper editor involved (getting bogged down in the details slowed the progression of the story's pacing- something I don't appreciate in an adventure novel).  The excitement within the story is a lost a bit due to his slow-detail-oriented writing style.  Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate it; if the premise of the story didn't interest me from the start, this is a book I would have otherwise put down after the first 100 pages 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 Of all the bad things I have read on Eastern Europe, this book is the worst.  I already wrote a long criticism in reviewing another of Roskin's books, so I will not repeat it here, although he deserves all the criticism he can get.  If "chitatel"'s students liked Roskin's book, it only goes to show how harmful the book is: uninitiated students, without other access to information on the region, read Roskin as if he were telling the truth 
 I was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight.  It looked to be WalMart type quality.  I would have been better off buying from Linens and Things 
 This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a "real" sociology book 
 I agree with the first review, this book gets frustrating. I am a student and am still learning how to use Maya and I find in this book that it sort of tells you what to do rather than tell you what your doing. Also, lose the pronouns; every now and then the book starts explaining something and it can be hard to know what it's talking about because it expects you to know certain things you have already done. It does teach you the basic principles and techniques though, but you will probably have to read through a few times to fully understand it. I haven't read any of the other books, but i suggest to keep looking before deciding on this one 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 Books comparing rival theological systems should primarily be about translating across schemes. This is what people want in reading these kinds of books. They are in one view and they want to understand the other view. To effectively meet this end, one has to be familiar with both sides, that is, one has to know how to speak the language of the other guy.  Unfortunately this isn't accomplished.  While the two Orthodox writers give a basic overview of Orthodox teaching, they fail in two basic ways. First, they fail to grasp the language and system of their Protestant interlocutors and therefore do not adequately address their objections. They show a very superficial understanding of Reformation theology. Second, they fail to get to the heart of the differences which lie in Trintarian theology, Christology and theological method. A much more effective exposition and hence argument could have been made.    The Protestant participants suffer from the same kinds of problems plus others. The baptist contributor forcuses on abuses mainly in the Russian jurisdiction. This is hardly a fair tactic, for the abuses, theological, moral or administrative are anecdotal, that is, they are limited to his experience. Second, considering that the Russian Church was practically exterminated by the Soviets, it is understandable if its laity/clergy who were prohibited from learning the Bible or going to seminary are ignorant of basic Christian teaching and moral praxis.  In fact the baptist contributor ultimately confesses ignorance as to what the real issues are between Reformation and Orthodox soteriology, indicating that he shouldn't even be a participant.  Horton's contribution is better but suffers from the same general failure to grasp the theological system and langauge of the people on the other side, and thereby mount and effective critique.  Granted that the Orthodox representatives failed to give an adequate articulation of the Orthodox view of justifiction, it certainly wouldn't have been hard to find one. There are a number of such articles readily available in Orthodox scholarly journals. (See for example, Church and Justification. An Orthodox Approach to the Issue of Justification and Collective Faith, The Greek Orthodox Theological Review 28 (1983)). And Horton follows his usual modus operandi of tarring people with positions that they do not affirm. For example because he isn't familiar with understand the Orthodox teaching on faith, he simply denotes it as the same teaching as Roman Catholicism, specifically the idea of "implicit faith." Horton makes this kind of move on a number of occasions, reducing Orthodox teaching to Catholic teaching to make it easier to criticize. In point of fact though, the Orthodox while having some superficial similarities to Catholicism, understand things differently because they have a different Trinitarian theology, Christology, soteriology and anthropology. Horton shows nothing more than a superficial understanding of Orthodox theology because he simply hasn't done any substantial reading in it, as is evidenced in his use of only a few fairly popular sources and his constant inability to draw the appropriate conclusions.   If you are coming from an Evangelical/Reformation background and you want to understand Orthodox teaching from the inside out, below are some works that will save you time and money in the long run.  An abosolute must is Joseph Farrell's Free Choice in St. Maximus the Confessor, which is an analysis of Maximus' theology and ends with a comparison with Augustinianism. Hard to find, but well worth it. Maximus is a central theological figure for Orthodox theology. Just as it is not possible to understand western theology apart from Augustine, so it is not possible to understand Eastern theology apart from Maximus.  Farrell's translations of the Disputation with Pyrrus and Photius' Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit are short, inexpensive and packed with information. Farrell knows how to translate ideas and spell out the conceptual connections.  John Romanides, Ancestral Sin, is a helpful exposition of the Orthodox teaching on anthropology, and the Fall and a critique of western conceptions.  John Meyendorff's Christ in Eastern Christian Thought, is also a must to understand the centrality of Christology to Orthodox theology and how the Orthodox understand Christology.  Meyendoff's, Salvation in Christ: Lutheran-Orthodox dialog, is also helpful, though somewhat overly optomistic.  Michel Barnes, The Power of God, and David Bradshaw's, Aristotle East and West are both vergy good works and should be read together-Barnes first, then Bradshaw.  Richard Haugh's Photios and the Carolingians: The Trinitarian Contoversy, is short but very helpful.  Henri Crouzel's Origen. Origen is one of the most important figures in Christian theology, for he is the source of most of the debates in Christology and Trinitarian theology in the first millenium of the church.  While not Orthodox, other helpful works are, Arvin Vos, Aquinas, Calvin and Contemporary Protestant Thought, and, Harry McSorely's Luther: Right or Wrong, Rupert Davies, The Problem of Authority in the Continental Reformers 
 GNR were a very overrated band. I found Appetite For Destruction very dull. This atleast has the band's 3 GREAT songs in November Rain, Civil War, and Live And Let Die. Get this for 3 great songs but stay away from GNRS OTHER CRAPPY SONGS AND ALBUMS!! THEY ARE NOT METAL! 
 I am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by FAR the most one-sided book I've ever read.  It wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of Aileen Wuornos.  He has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular.  He made Ms. Wuornos out to be someone she wasn't.  She had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about.  Again, it wasn't worth the $.  I actually threw my copy of this away 
 This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic.  
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 Is science a religion?  Well, of course, that depends on what you mean by religion.  I think that science is important.  Science certainly has its problems, as any human activity does.  Science is also all we have in the struggle against irrationality.  If you think that makes science my religion, so be it.  Winnick criticizes scientists such as Sagan, Dawkins, and Gould because they want to promote science.  I don't see how it is a bad thing for them to be enthusiastic about science, given that they believe is vital to humanity's future.    Winnick says some things about science that are simply silly.  Darwinism has its roots partly in the politics of its time--so what?  The important thing is whether the evidence supports it.  It does.  Creationism has dozens of questions which it has never answered:  Why do animals have rudimentary organs like the appendix, or the leg bones found in some whales?  Why do some animals go extinct?  Why are so many unique life forms found on islands?  Why do different places around the world that have similar climates have different animals?  Why are animals that live in caves more closely related to animals living on the ground above them than to animals living in caves far away?  Evolution has good answers to all these questions.  Creationism has "God wanted it that way," end of discussion.  Winnick argues that favorable mutations are too rare for evolution to work, an improbability as great as a monkey typing out the works of Shakespeare.  Please don't accept this without reading Dawkins' book "The Blind Watchmaker," which addresses precisely this question.  While mutation is random, evolution is NOT random; evolution is based on the cumulative survival of favorable variations.  If a monkey types for a long time and whenever he by chance types the correct letter it is retained, he will in fact type the works of Shakespeare.    Winnick also says that science cannot explain behaviors such as charity that have nothing to do with survival.  Winnick clearly missed the very extensive scientific literature on the evolution of altruism.  Charity certainly can and does evolve--if it benefits the individual involved or those related to him.  Bees have evolved to sting a bear attacking the hive, even at the cost of their own lives, because all the bees of the hive are closely related to one another.  The genes get passed on preferentially, even though a few individuals die.  Humans are social animals who are highly dependent on their communities for survival; charity is a big part of the social glue holding those communities together.  It is not mysterious.    Given that I am an atheist and a scientist, Winnick and I are clearly coming from very different points of the ideological spectrum.  If you are inclined to take all of Winnick's book at face value, I would strongly urge you to read some contrary viewpoints.  My own personal favorite is Sagan's "Science as a Candle in the Dark."  Winnick takes the survival of human life--any human life--as the ultimate good, no matter what the cost.  I am a little puzzled as to why a Christian would take this view.  If an elderly cancer patient's next stop is Heaven, why put a lot of money and effort into prolonging their final illness?  When does keeping a dying person alive become sadism?  When it comes to a one-pound preemie, I tend to think putting him in an ICU for months, doing complex surgery, and the like, is more like sadism than like compassion.  If Christians feel it is important to keep people alive no matter what, I would suggest that Christians be the ones to pay the medical bills in such cases.    Another problem with the "life at any cost" approach is that it assumes that the earth can hold any number of people.  This is not the case.  This is abundantly shown by the accumulating environmental problems we face today, not to mention the declining standard of living in the U.S.  We are exhausting the natural resources on which ALL human lives depend very rapidly.(For more on this, I would suggest Diamond's book "Collapse" and Kunstler's book "The Long Emergency.") A stable population is an absolute necessity to get this situation under control.  Population control is no liberal fad; on the contrary, it is deeply conservative.  Given that we only have one planet to live on, we should be cautious about doing new things with it, including putting lots of new people on it.  Whatever else you may say about abortion, it is an effective and inexpensive method of controlling the number of people.  If you feel abortion is unethical, you still need to come up with a way to keep the population of the earth at a sustainable level.  I don't see Christian churches ponying up the necessary money to pay for billions of people to learn and practice the rhythm method.  This is condemning people--not fetuses, grown people--to death by war, disease, and ecological disaster.  That doesn't strike me as genuine respect for human life.    That said, I was surprised to find that Winnick and I do have some points of agreement.  I am no fan of high-tech infertility procedures, for the obvious reason that I think we have more people already than we need.  Such procedures also cost huge amounts of money that could be better spent elsewhere.    I also oppose heart transplants, though not for the same reasons Winnick does.  In my opinion, compared to the huge costs, the number of people whose lives can be saved by heart transplants is so small that transplants can only be considered a waste of time and money.  The same is true for most other organ transplants, and indeed for much of modern high-tech medicine.  Other countries have health as good as, or in some cases better, than we do here in the U.S., for a fraction of the cost.  Much of high-tech surgery and medicine has surprisingly little solid scientific support as to its effectiveness.  This is not a criticism of science.  It is a criticism of doctors, who have allowed greed to lead them into forgetting about science and using unproven, fantastically expensive treatments on patients.  Winnick spends a lot of time criticizing science education.  I agree with her that science is taught very poorly at present in the U.S.  This is not because it is godless, but because there is a long-standing tendency in education to implement "reforms" without any evidence that the reforms will improve education.  To make matters worse, most of the educational research that is done is of truly awful quality: sample sizes too small, samples not randomized, controls poorly done, results followed for too short a time, costs of implementing proposed reforms not taken into account, etc.  (Given the importance of education in society and the economy, you'd think good research and lots of it would be a priority.  But at present that's not the case.)  Winnick falls into a trap here: she criticizes science education as being too focused on rote learning.  But the replacement of rote learning with more creative approaches has been a goal of educational reformers for centuries, with a remarkable lack of success in improving education. Rote learning is enormously easier on the teacher than more "creative" approaches are, making it far cheaper to teach kids and making teacher retention and burnout far less of a problem.  In addition, there's little or no evidence that kids learn more or are more creative if they're taught by "creative" approaches than by rote learning.   When it comes to improving peoples' lives, in my opinion the road to Hell is indeed paved with good intentions.  If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago. We deserve better. 
 This book is about a ung boy named bud and is liveing with a bad family that is mean to him after a while and they lock in a shed one night and he desides to run away.When he runs away he sleeps under a tree in front of a libary that serves beakfeast and so on.Then after a couple nights he leaves the tree and trys to find his father.after hours of walking a man picks him up and helps him try and find his father 
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 The Thelemic paradigm is a literary tradition and bohemian will-based philosophies that Mr. Crowley merely popularized.  Much of the will-centred philosophies & ideas leaking from Liber AL are by no means new or Crowley's own invention.  Liber AL vel Legis contains no new religious or spiritual revelations to guide the human species out of it's "dark night of the soul."  The formulas contained therein are of a Gnostic flavour, Crowley & the Thelemic cult is best digested by studying his works as if studying results from lab rats 
 This book was a big waste of money.  The information is so basic only a real novice would learn anything.  And don't believe the positive reviews  you read for Kelly's books.  It's obvious he wrote them himself, since no  one with a brain would praise the kind of junk he puts out 
 I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better. 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 This is my second book by Moore that I've read.  I have found him to be an alternative thinker.  He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk.  I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her.  I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.    
 First, I'll preface this review in stating that I'm reviewing the abridged audio version of this book.  I avoid abridged versions of any book, but this one was given me by a friend to read.  As the story unfolded in the beginning it was quite interesting.  After awhile though the story line became quite predictable.  Consistancy was lacking in the leading characters.  Their personalities and responses were modified to fit, what seemed to be, a greatly contrived and simplistic story line.  After getting two-thirds through the book my interest was no longer in what happened to the characters, but whether my theories on what will happen was correct.  Most people seemed to really like the book and again I can only relate to the heavily abridged CD version.  I suspect that so much was chopped out of the story that the summary of events not told gave too many clues to future events.  Stay away from abridgements because even if a story is good, they will most often disappoint!  
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 Extremely well-researched, and virtually unreadable.  This book is a never ending stream of figures on steel tonnages and plant openings/closings.  The author provides little in the way of explanation of the vast amount of industry jargon in the book (If you already know what is different and interesting about Continuous Casting, Finishing Capacity, Open Hearth vs. other blast furnace types, etc. this probably won't bother you).  There are some interesting story lines relating to the personalities, changes in American society, and the arc of the corporation as an entity over 100 years, but they are lost in the endless forest of statistics and the repetitive theme that the corporation was too big for its own good.   
 I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy.  Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation.  There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented.  I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed.  Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario 
 I bought this book brand new, and every page I have turned has fallen out.  It does NOT use algebraic notation, and it is a much bigger nuisance than some say.  There's nothing more frustrating than looking to the solutions page after being stumped for twenty minutes plus, only to have to interpret each move of the solution.  Some of the problems are absurdly difficult (I'm about a 1500 player) and thus a waste of time since you don't learn anything from a seven move combination that only a master could spot.  This was my third tactics book, and remains the only area of chess where I can't improve.  As for telling you the theme involved, it actually made it harder for me to solve problems because it put blinders on me to other elements of the position.  One problem presented a pin, and the first move was to make a mating threat on the far side of the board.  I was so fixated on the pin I never even considered the correct move.  In every other area of chess we are taught principles that guide intelligent play.  But in tactics it's just "Here's a thousand problems.  Fail for long enough and you'll get slightly better."  Don't expect much improvement from this book.   
 how many modern day jaws rip-offs do there need to be. Well! Okay this film i would rank lower than 2 stars if it wasn't for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist. The other reason was i think Casper Van Dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him. But this movie stunk. In no ways does it compare to jaws nor even Deep Blue Sea. I hated almost every moment of it. If you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy Deep Blue Sea. Or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years. Don't be fooled this is a waste of time and effort. This film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none. ... 
 I'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage.  Buying this for kids and all that.  Its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting, at least to me, but hopefully it is to kids.  However, they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult Clue, and not in a good way.  The "room" variable for example, drops out.  Its not relevant.  Its who ait the cake at what time with what drink.  It just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant.      The idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler.  Well, the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place.  And the change sort of makes it more complex in a way.  You need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens.  Now the sheet does list the rooms, you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens.  But since the rooms are not otherwise relevant, its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens.    The game is also incredibly cheaply constructed.  For example, the "die" does not have numbers on it, you have to put number stickers on it.  And the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement.    Anyway, not recommended 
 First off, i have to say, that I don't think this is a horrible cd and I don't think that this is a horrible band. There's no denying that Doyle and Jerry Only were key components of the Danzig-era Misfits; yet, for this band to call themselves the Misfits, and even worse, have fans applaud them and their releases, is insane. once again, i don't think this band sucks, far from it, but without Danzig it's not the Misfits but rather a second, no, third rate version of the Misfits trudging along and trying to recap what the band once was. Without the Key ingredient, the primary creative force of the orignial band, this is nothing more than a disgrace to the Misfits name. Face it folks, it's like trying to bake a cake without flour... 
 after few months it just stopped working.  also, it is not rechargable, and need to replace batery every 1-2 week 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 I was disappointed. After reading the other reviews I expected something useful but this book is so basic it looked like the authors just threw together a few articles and basic web research. I would recommend this book only if you have no experience in business, have never taken a business course, nor read any other book on business ever 
 Nearly ten years on, 'Hear In The Now Frontier' is still as piss-weak and irrelevant as it was when it was released. This album was the first clear and present sign of the band's creative demise, which for me back in 1997 was an absolute shock considering how impressed I was with all of their previous albums. Up until this point, Queensryche were in my top 5 bands of all time, however with this subsiquent release and the wishy washy Q2K that followed, they sadly lost my undivided attention.    As far as good songs, the album is very shakey indeed. Limp and dull are the only words that I can describe them, very forgetable. Lyrically the album is hit and miss although 'Sign Of The Times' has a great message of the current decline of safetly and security in US schools due to firearms. There are some good moments such as 'Some People Fly' and 'You' but the vast majority of 'Hear In The Now Frontier' left me totally uninspired. It is really hard to picture that this was the same band who wrote and recorded the masterpiece 'Operation Mindcrime'.  Strangely, it was Geoff Tate's vocal delivery on this album that left me so unimpressed considering that it was his voice that attracted me to the band in the first place. His vocal phrasing and choice of melodies just seem forced, as though he is trying to re-invent his style to fit into the current musical climate of the late 90's. The band also seem to be be compromising their sound to conform more with the musical trends of the day but just fall so far short.  Although I never whould have thought this prior to the release of this album, it is Chris DeGarmo's lead vocal effort on 'All I Want' that is the only reason why I pull this album out of the collection. By far the strongest song on the disc; catchy, melodic and emotive, 'All I Want' is out of place like a bit of an oasis in a desert. From the general consensus amoungst Queensryche fans, putting this track the record with "another person singing" lead instead of Mr Tate was highly criticizable. So severe was the negitive backlash, it was part of the reason why Chris DeGarmo quite the band. For me, 'All I Want' it is the only reason for me to even rate this album although I will say that it does not sound like a Queensryche song and for that I can understand some fans having issues with it.  Harsh as this review may be, this album was when Queensyche failed to continue to be the superband they once were.  
 I have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more, francis francis being my first.  This machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as "espresso" machines but marginally.  If you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important.  Focusing on the machine for a moment. You need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee.  A truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste.  This machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans.  The espresso extracted is thus poor in taste.  If you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra.  You will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results. The cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the  cutting of the beans are fixed 
 Don't buy this album.  You would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic, emotionless, tired, garbage.  Merkin Dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting (ie. Massive Attack, Air, Everything But the Girl), plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in.  Someone thought Track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says, "Does my hard drive turn you on?"  What is wrong with you people?  If you want decent robo-pop music, try Kraftwerk, Figurine, or even Ladytron.  My advice to Merkin Dream is to stop making music because you're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you're something good 
 This book you might browse through amazon=s Search Inside system. You will see it is nothing but a collection of irrelevant "how many angels dance on the head of a pin?" questions, formative not normative.  To discover the essence and truth of what Catholics really believe, study instead the Reverend Father Richrd McBrien: Catholicism. Study the National Conference of Bishop-s The Challenge of Peace: GOd-s Promise and Our Response. Study the good Pope John-s Pacem in Terris. Study Gaudium et Spes, and you will discover that NO Catholic can participate in any way indirectly nor directly in our sixteen year long war against Iraq, which has left over a million dead. Study our US Conference of Catholic Bishop=s Economic Justice For All, and realize the horror of our current administration=s domestic and foreign policies. Read Father Fox=s Creation SPirituality and relaize the accounting we will have to give of our stewardship of creation.  Instead of these meaningless considerations in this present book, read Archbishop Romero, Father Ellacuria, and consider carefully their martyrdoms for the poor of our Church and for their Gospel witness. Read the Reverend Father John Dear, SJ, and his companion, the courageous and thoughtful and Reverend Father Daniel Berrigan. Read Thomas Merton, especially his Peace in a Post=Christian Era, and contemplate that which a true Catholic Really Believes. Further study carefully Bishop Pedro Casaldaliga, the Rev. Father Charles Curran, Fr. Leonardo Boff=s writings especially his recent commentaries on the Our Father and the Hail Mary, and his earlier contemplation of the Stations of the Cross. Read the Magnificat, the prayer of Mary as to fate of the wealthy and of the poor.  Therein you may discover that which a Catholic Really Believes. Not here in Keating. All of these references are still available within the mighty amazon. 
 I can see from reading the below reviews that I'm not the only one who hates this thing. What a total waste! I got it for my little one, remembering how much I (and every other kid I've ever known) loved this toy. Well, this version has been made too safe to have any fun on. It barely spins. If you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength, then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day. It's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all. Not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control. Which I could deal with if the thing was any fun at all 
 Warning only read this book if you are brain dead, wearing rose colored glasses, and will believe anything you are told by the Peterson legal camp both former and current as well as his supporters...if this description fit's you will love this book 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 Having used the Owl Clip Light with success previously, chose to order through Amazon (to a secondary provider)for a gift.  The gift finally arrived, broken and unable to be used.  Also, at the same time, ordered one to keep for future gift - it has never arrived. Probably will never order through a secondary provider again 
 This speaker is only slightly louder than the internal speakers in my IBM laptop. 
 No suprises here folks... if you read the Chris Ware-edited MCSWEENEY'S #13, this book is more of the same. The pieces from Ware, Heatley, Barry and Deitch were all originally published in MCSWEENEY'S. Different stories from Sacco, Hernandez, Porcellino, Katchor, Crumb and Brunetti were also published in MCSWEENEY'S. Other selections seemed very superflous either because they've been around in serial format for a while, they've already had a fair amount of exposure, or both. A good example of these is an excerpt from Jessica Abel's LA PERDIDA and a Jonathan Bennet story from MOME.   The result is an anthology that presumes the reader knows little about what has been going on in comics of the past 5 years, which is fine if that is the scope of the book. However to see the same names (and at times, the same stories) makes the assumption that there's nothing else going on. Here's a challenge for an editor of any upcoming book like this: leave the above names out and seek out some fresh talent. It's out there! 
 I can not recommend this unit because my experience is that after receiving a new RC-800, it switches off before I even manage to start scanning or during a scan, after finished about 30-40% the battery icon turn red and switch off. And this is a brand new scanner!!! Have written to support today, so hopefully they will come back with a solution!   But as it is today, I find both the manual, faq and problem solver for specific scanner very very incomplete. First I find the online support very confusing. If you want to find out how the batteries works with the RC-800, the online support is just saying something about coin batteries and recommend you to change them without specifying that this is only for the previous models and not RC-800. I went out buying a new set coin batteries not realizing, that this was only for DokuPen R700 and BW: :o(  Also very little information to help you to solve a specific problem for a specific model!  Per 
 I feel that this book is way too technical. I mean, I know that I'm still a kid but usually I can follow a story line without having to stop and try to figure out what they're talking about. I don't suggest buying this book 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 ...but I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that the recipes fall short. Many of them sound absolutely delicious, but I have found many errors and in recipes where there are no obvious errors, I often have to make adjustments to the seasonings or ingredients (for example, I made the Lemon Tahini Sauce tonight to go with the baked Falafel Balls...the falafel balls recipes is missing a step, and the lemon tahini sauce calls for way, way too much tahini and the end product is not what the recipe describes. I could fix both mistakes, but I shouldn't have to).  I wish they would do some heavy revising to this cookbook, because it has so much promise.  
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 Ralph Bakshi's boho fantasy Wizards, like Richard Williams' doomed Thief and the Cobbler, is a reaction against Disney animated features and shares many of its flaws, as well as many of its own. For all his talk about wanting to show Disney how to tell a real story with real passion, there's a real lack of story and worse, a real lack of feeling that the dull characters and disinterested vocal performances only draw attention to. But perhaps most fatal of all is the largely uninteresting animation that often seems pitched somewhere between Filmation and underground comics, with the more interesting (and potentially expensive) sequences played purely as two-tone still concept images with Susan Tyrell's flat narration giving the film an uncompleted work-in-progress look. The use of crudely rotoscoped footage from El Cid, Alexander Nevsky and Zulu for the choppy battle scenes is also rather too awkward to work, especially since it is never properly integrated with the genuinely animated characters. At its heart there's a vaguely interesting notion (it's certainly not developed enough to be called an idea) about the war between technology and magic - embodied by two brother wizards at each others throats for thousands of years - coming to a head when the bad one discovers the motivating power of Nazi propaganda, but too often it's simply clumsily reacting against the Disney formula rather than telling a story and you can see all too clearly the early signs of just how badly Bakshi would mess up The Lord of the Rings here.  Still, Fox's DVD boasts a nice widescreen transfer and a good selection of extras - an audio commentary by Bakshi and a 35-minute documentary on him and the film, various stills galleries, TV spot and two trailers. 
 The lids do not seal properly, and everything leaks when you are trying to pour the jello into the molds 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution!   With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.  WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!! 
 Though this is a nice little book with good photo illustrations of the postures/exercises and a nice introduction to chakras, these exercises are very difficult for a beginning student. I will try them further down the fitness road, much further 
 I agree with another reviewer: this book is not worth reading for its prose.  The cover got my hopes up--perhaps this would be an irreverant, clever review of the many mistakes and learnings as we have explored the strange new world of distributed computing over the last several years.  Something like Gregory Pfister's excellent "In Search of Clusters" (ASIN 0138997098).  Instead, this is a very turgid, encyclopedic survey of the topic, without much to guide the reader.  For instance, distributed object-based systems are very old, why doesn't Tanenbaum mention their myriad problems?  NFS, with its attempt to make remote filesystems look local, and extensive kernel hooks, can be very painful to use and operate.  You would not want to write a distributed file system like NFS today!  How was that not mentioned?  Instead, this book treats all distributed systems as if they had equal worth and utility, with dry comparisons of features, and no sense of what the core lessons of distributed computing have been.  This is obviously one book in a chain aimed at the academic market.  Perhaps it has a place there, but I wouldn't want to be a in a class that used this book 
 If your christian dont buy this,It has nothing to do with the 5 books of Moses,also no true idea on religion 
 This audio book has no read along for kids, a big disappointment 
 H. L.  Mencken is perhaps (along with many of the adherents who pay him more attention than he deserves) the responsible for the creation of the figure known today as "intellectual snob", a person who merely devotes his existence to judge the work of others and who deems himself equally important (or even superior) to the own writers.  I have always thought that this pathetic guy had a recurrent wet dream in which he imagined that he was the author of "The Devil's Dictionary". Unfortunately for him, Ambrose Bierce was one and only. Bad luck, Mr. Mencken.  His taste in literature was nothing out of the ordinary and left something to be desired, as shown by his appreciation of a repellent racist troglodyte like Jack London and other mediocre authors. He even dared to say that Bierce's experimental fictions were useless; this last judgement being quite paradoxical, if we take into account that Mencken always ludicrously tried to imitate Bierce's mordant style for his own sake.   Who cares about this Mencken? He never wrote fiction. He's just a critic... Why bother reading his out-dated and erroneous assessments and his insufferable mental diarrhoea? You'd better be spending your time in real literature and learning to draw your own conclusions about it (I know it's difficult, but you can do it if you try). Use your brain if you have one and forget "the crackpot of Baltimore". 
 I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy. Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials. 
 I found this book to be offensive.  On page 2, the author acknowledges the language differences of the process (toilet training vs. toilet learning).  As a reader, I understood her position and was comfortable to progress onto further pages.  As I continued reading, I was content with the author's writing until I accessed Chapter 4, where she discusses the positions of experts and references some of their works.  On page 47, she references the controversial book of "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day," by Nathan Azrin, Ph.D. and Richard Foxx, Ph.D. and that their "program was devised not for speed, but to help the retarded learn this difficult skill."  I think the term "mentally challenged" or "developmentally challenged" would have been more appropriate.  In spite of my shock that someone would write a book and refer to those with special needs as "retarded", I continued on until I accessed Chapter 6, "How Can I Train My Child Under Special Circumstances?"  Under the section "Using Public Restrooms Alone", the author discusses what she considers "supervised" use of facilities.  She states that a parent can stand outside the door while the child uses the facilities alone.  She states that a parent can "ask an appropriate-looking man to take the boy into the restroom while you wait outside the door. (Same for situations with girls, Dad.)" and to "only let a child alone to one that is in shouting distance or in view."  In a world where pedophiles are lurking in such areas and seize those moments when a child is alone to harm them, I find that advice to be completely irresponsible.  At that point, I could no longer continue reading this book and take advice from someone who would make such irresponsible suggestions.

 As other reviews have said that the author does not spell out the specific language needed for deals.  That is because they want you to sign up for their Real Estate Seminars.  Stay away from Peter Conti and his company.  I have had a very bad experience with them and do not recommend 
 I bought this DVD wishing to improve the picture quality of my old dvd collection. I didn't notice anything when compare to my old $33 dvd. I don't understand any review made on this item. The image is not even close to hd 780p, so why is this DVD called upconverter HD 1080p? The upconvertion might be because it has a HDMI output, but nothing else. The images displayed are comparable to any other dvd player. I'm going to keep it anyway because it is very flat and it fits my cabinet. But if you are looking to upconvert your old dvd collection to HD 1080p , forget it. The only way to watch HD 1080p is with the blueray dvd or the HD dvd. In other hand, I believe that if you have a high-end HDTV they come with internal upconverters that won't let you notice any difference when comparing this product to any other dvd. Keep your money for... !speakers! 
 Within an hour of removing this set of earphones from it's packaging, i found the sound went out in the left earphone unless it's adjustable clip was placed in very particular way.  I should've returned the item at that point.   I didn't, and over the next 45 days the right earphone followed suit. Also, the rubber rings around thephones fell off and were lost.  These may be common problems with earphones, but at $40.00 this is a terrible value.  My $7.00 Sony earphones sounf as good and have not shown to be as fragile. 
 Terrible and boring! He leaves info out that was later all addressed and dismissed in court. He tries to report after only six months on the case.An opportunist 
 The client has never received the book.  We have checked with USPS and they do not have a record of the book being delivered.  Who do I need to talk to?  Thanks 
 Where to start?  I love the Sanibel/Doc Ford stories.  I love Sanibel. I go back there every year. This land-locked Floridian wallows in Florida myth, legend and just stories about redneck cow chasers, crooks, all things water and any story by Randy White. BUT, I was confused a lot by this story. It just seemed a bit of a rip off. It just didn't seem honest somehow and I don't even know if that makes sense.  Maybe, it isn't honesty, maybe it was pressure to get another novel done, maybe it's an honest effort to do something different (God knows, I get that)but it hopped all over and just wasn't, well, coherent most of the time. I still await the next no matter what.  I trust.    
 The DVD is missing some of the scenes that are in the TV version. There are no deleted scenes either. Where did the scenes go and why? I expected the DVD to have more, not less than the TV version 
 This book at least had the redeeming quality of letting me know what not to do if I ever get laid off again (its already happened twice).  Networking with other unemployed individuals - a waste of time.  Resume polishing - get a book for $10 and do what it says.  This woman spent thousands of dollars and almost a year looking for a job with coaches and networking sessions (with other unemployed individuals!!).  She thought her problems might be related to her age or some other reason not her fault.  How about her work experience?  How about her skill set?  If you are looking for a job in a field where there aren't many available, then you might need to develop new skills.  I was 40 and had spent 6 years at home with my kids when I decided to go back to work.  I got 2 interviews and one job offer, which I accepted and was at work 6 weeks after starting my search. Due to being in a consolidating industry (banking) and to my lengthy time at home, I had only one reference from my previous jobs.  In 2001 I was laid off when my job was moved out of town, but I had a new one long before my severance checks ended.  The corporate world is very different from the writing world.  Barbara Ehrenreich is probably fine being a writer, but her comments make me believe that she would be a very poor participant in the corporate world.  Her comments about some of her fellow jobseekers were curious - didn't she realize that the woman who continued to wear suits to work into an environment where they were not considered appropriate & got fired for it, probably had a hard time getting a decent job because she did not take the clues around her about how to behave?   Her condescending attitude towards corporations is ridiculous.  She uses a computer, flies on planes, stays in hotels, visits Starbucks - all corporations that provide useful products & services and employment for millions.  They're not perfect, but neither are writers.  There are plenty of bad writers, just as there are some bad apple corporations.   Unemployment can be a problem as you get older.  My husband was laid off after 30 years at his (failing) company, but even at his age he was able to find a job before severance and unemployment ran out.  It wasn't easy but if you develop skills that are marketable (and PR may not be) and you are looking in an area with a good economy, then it is not impossible.  
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.  Not only did it lack in technical medical information, but I found it to be harsh and unsupportive.  The author's attempt at humor was, to me, offensive and harsh.   If you are looking for the medical technical side of infertility, pick up Dr. Sherman Silbers book.  If you are looking for lighthearted emotional support with excellent tips and coping tools, pick up IVF The Wayward Stork. Save your money on this one. 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 I saw this book at a local shop and thought, "Wow! What a great gift!" (for a soon-to-be-born neice or nephew).   Unfortunately, this book has fit four, original pages onto two, "Treasury" pages.  Something truly gets lost in the translation.  The type is too small and the illustrations are difficult to fully appreciate.    I returned the book to the shelf and am in the process of ordering some of the originals from amazon.com instead 
 Granted, Sarah and Paul's marriage was so - so; she'd cheated on him more than once, but one time had been prior to their marriage. They slept together seldom, but had managed to produce a son. Still, when Paul decided he wanted out, it hurt. The results of Sarah's coping with that decision and putting her life back together are chronicled in this book.   ** At the high spots, it is funny, and at the lows it gets a bit mean spirited, just like life. **  Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer 
 After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two 
 This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.     The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.   
 Clive Cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful U.S. government agency. After many successful books, Clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with Paul Kemprecos who co-writes an analogous series which uses the same agency, plots, and characters. Oh, this series does change some things, the main character is Kurt not Dirk and his sidekick is Mexican and not Italian. Also, there is a second pack of characters (Paul and Gamay Trout) who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes.  None of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular. In typical fashion, the first chapter is a historical look that "sets the stage." In this case it is an aerial combat over the Alps in 1914 between an industrialist and six (6!!) combat pilots. Needless to say, the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed. The next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread - this time it is a "survivor"-type of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings. The third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go.  Unfortunately, this book is too formulaic. It does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is, nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads. The only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy's attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans.  As is usual in these novels, there are high speed car chases, underwater action, aerial acrobatics (in world war 1 vintage planes no less!), underwater escapades and explosion galore. throughout them all, the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed (Even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types) and the world is rescued by the effort of one man - Kurt Austin. There is a love interest (why a different one in each book? Doesn't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest?) who is French, and side visits to Scotland and Massachusetts.  The only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that I was exposed to the "Premium" format which is a slightly longer/taller book with more space between the lines. The book cover states that this format is "Specially designed for comfortable reading" but I cannot say that it improved things for me that much.  To summarize, as a Clive Cussler fan, I had to read this book to make sure I keep up with the adventures, but this one is not in the top two-thirds of his efforts. I am sure that Kurt Austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
 Last stage of cancer, will seek no treatment, courtesy of Mary Baker Eddy's self-serving ideologies.  I've studied CS to try to better undestand my mother, but all I found were half truths, contextual lies, and a cherry-picking of the Bible.  Another reviewer stated, "Avoid this book like the plague...It will kill you"  Folks, you have no idea how true that is...  Amazon needs a zero-star rating reserved for poisonous products 
 It is nice to see that so many writers still believe in a Newtonian universe.  Deterministic, with a Prime Mover.  No bothersome questions about the origins of the universe, no need to explore the vastness of space, and a deep distrust of the possibilities contained in each new generation.  But it's ok.  Darwin loves you, man.   
 I don't usually make impulse buys of books; usually I at least skim reviews on Amazon before buying to get an idea of what others have said.  However, I'm traveling to China for the first time in summer and saw this book in the bookstore ... it looked interesting and I've seen this Culture Shock! series around so I thought I'd give it a shot.  While I can't say the book was a complete waste of money, as Sinclair does have good insights amongst some completely bizarre and mystifying statements, I'd say this book is better read as a library copy (i.e. for free) or not at all.  Why?  Here's why:  First and foremost, the author has a severe case of Terminal Expatriate.  He comments condescendingly on fellow foreigners in and out of China (especially those who dare to criticize the Party line) all the while adding worthless commentary on his own personal experiences.  While sometimes interesting, many are simply pointless.  The example that sticks out in my mind the best was an entire subsection devoted to one mere paragraph about the fact that "some people" find it hard to make Chinese friends while the author of course has never had this problem.  In general, the author's "been there, done that ... and better than anyone else could hope to do!" attitude grows irritating before long.  As does his infatuation with the Communist way of doing things.  It's one thing to support their policies, if it's done in a balanced manner, but Sinclair basically says that anyone who dares to disagree is an ignorant and stupid outsider.  He, as an Old China Hand is given full reign to criticize, of course.  He is also often self-righteous and hypocritical (always a dangerous, if not slightly amusing, combination), especially when it comes to the world's oldest profession.  Sex clearly weighs on Sinclair's mind quite a bit as he talks about it frequently, often incoherently.  Pimps should be shot, johns should be jailed (except Sinclair, he prefers to choose women rather than be "chosen"), and despite the rampant adult prostitution thank goodness for the one-child law or China would be crawling with child prostitutes too!  Sinclair sounds like he's swallowed whole a little bit too much of the Party propaganda.  Also, as someone who simply plans to visit China (not live there long term) I was disappointed at the very little space devoted to very practical matters (ordering at restaurants, picking a place to stay, riding taxis and trains, etc.).  To me it felt like a disproportionate amount of space was used to talk about the modern history of China and interesting but far from practical commentary on modern cultural mores.  While interesting, many of these have little or no impact for the casual tourist, even one interested in the culture and history of China.  For a guide that claims to be a guide to "customs and etiquette" remarkably little of either is discussed.  One wonders if this Terminal Expatriate has been in China too long to relate with the casual tourist or resident and speak to him or her in practical and relevant terms.  Perhaps most of all, I finished the book wondering what if anything I'd learned that I couldn't have learned from reading the notes in my Lonely Planet tour guide, or found on the internet by simply Google-ing "China" or looking in Wikipedia.  The trivial information, plethora of typos, and opinionated and flat-out judgmental commentary grew tiresome after a while.  I cannot honestly say I'd re-read this book, let alone recommend it to others.  Not an awful book, but it left me feeling slightly nauseous and dirty, as if I'd just left one of the smoke-filled parties Sinclair likes to talk about after downing one too many mao tais 
 Whilst I normally try to stick with the WW2/cold war era naval stories, a friend of mine suggested I read one in the series of H Jay. Riker. My friend, who served on board a submarine for 20 years and later as military advisor (and stand in) on the movie Hunt For Red October, thought that I might enjoy Riker.  He was partly right.  Riker has written many books, mainly naval SEAL and submarine orientated, and I selected one of his later issues, about the Virginia Class submairne. The story line is set mid 2006 in the post WTC era. A Chinese submarine has been staffed by Pakistanie Al Queda nationals who engage several civilian targets around the Spratley Islands. Lt Garrett and the newest submarine the Virginia, are rerouted to pick up a Navy Seal team and investigate. During the underwater passage, two Kilo class submarines are in the water at the same time, one the Al Queada sub, the other Chinese. A battle ensues and well...the good guys ride off into the sunset and Garrett gets himself another woman.  On the shelves at any good store, titles are filled with Al Queda related subjects. The truth of the matter though has been that terrorism has been around for centuries, it was only the events of September 11 that thrust it's significance upon the USAmerican people.  I'm not a great fan of authors that capture an "media frenzy" and translate it through to their stories. In the back of my mind, I am almost sure that at some stage I have played a PC submarine game centred around the Spratley Islands which paralleled this story (might be a Tom Clancy story)  Whilst enjoyable as a read, it's somewhat future setting offset against current affairs wasn't enough to burst my bubble this time 
 As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not "real Tibetans" because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous

 I just wanted the song.....Stars are Blind........instead I got a mixture of horrible music, and a part where Paris sings part of the song, but the mix is so bad, I'm sorry I wasted my money. I bought the CD.  I suppose I should have bought the DVD then I would have heard the song I wanted to hear, but I'd still get the same mix music that is on the CD.  Save your money!!  I like Paris, and her song, but I don't advise anyone to buy the CD. 
 This is one of the greatest books ever written 
 Good stuff to kick back and drive down the highway with 
 The book's title is very misleading. The title implies that it covers the entire workflow process, but it does not. The book provides some very interesting case studies, from the perspective of a working cinematographer, and if you're just interested in shooting digital, the content will be quite informative. If you are looking for some more specific information on the post production process, such as editing digital content, and distribution, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
 By definition, the net promoter score is the percentage of respondents falling into the 9-10 range minus the percentage falling into the 0-6 range.  Consequently, very different distributions of advocacy scores can yield the same net promoter score; for example, all of the response distributions shown below yield net promoter scores of 40.                         Detractors (0-6)   |    0    5   10   15   20   25   30 Passives (7-8)     |   60   50   40   30   20   10    0 Promoters (9-10)   |   40   45   50   55   60   65   70                       ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---                       100  100  100  100  100  100  100    This is a problem because despite having the same net promoter score, these response distributions probably differ in their implications on repurchase behavior.  This also calls into question what conclusions we should draw from a difference or similarity between you and your competitors in terms of net promoter scores.   
 I really love the first Nightmare on Elm street movie. the rest of the series are just absurd and borderline ridiculous. I thought this movie would be better since Wes Craven was directing/writing it. In my opinion it's everything but scary.The concept of this evil entitity trapped in stories for eons is interesting, however not very well explored in my opinion.The scenes remind us of the first Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit cool when it comes to nostalgia but they completely have no surprise effect whatever. It was nice to see some people of the original movie, like John Saxon and Nick Corrie. Yet they have such small roles which undermines their presence in the movie.Corrie doesn't even have a line. The "scary" scenes are actually hilarious at some points. This movie could have been better in my opinion..

 This book attempts to offer a rebuttal to selective points argued in The Case for Christ. It is very hard to provide evidence for something that happened 2000 years ago. Try to prove that Socrates really existed, or try proving he didn't exist?   For example, if other historians at the time never mentioned Jesus, does that mean Jesus did not exist? No, it is impossible to DISPROVE Jesus just as it is impossible to completely prove Jesus existed. Saying the gospels are inconsistent and hard to believe is not proving Jesus didn't exist.   Can you prove who wrote the bible if the said authors didn't? Instead of trying to find inconsistencies in the gospels, can you prove, with evidence, Jesus never lived? If you can't prove with evidence that He didn't live, how do you expect someone to prove He did live?  The Case for Christ will make Christians happy. This book will make non-Christians happy. However, the book that actually talks with scholars themselves and gives them a chance to respond is The Case for Christ. 
 I've always thought of Diana Krall as a sellout. I've been told that she was not a singer by choice, that record execs saw dollar signs and "encouraged" this mediocre pianist to sing. They were lucky that Krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune, and can swing in a very middle of the road, 2 levels above white bread kind of way. But as a performer, she comes off as an emotionless robot. Her overall delivery is a droning monotone. Every song is performed the same way, in a husky, lilting, and ultimately boring as hell manner.  Since Norah Jones has effectively blown Krall out of the water in terms of sales, what could they think of as a comeback? How bout a Christmas album! Nothing says sellout like Christmas. And I actually like some of those songs, but to be honest, I'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to Krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes. In fact, I'd rather go Christmas Caroling in the Gaza Strip than listen to this unimaginative, boring, lifeless collection of performances.  OK, maybe I'm being too harsh. But once a tool, always a tool. Krall is too much part of the machine, so if she did have an original idea, I doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it.  Some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration, but overall sound very functional, commercial, and bland. Which fit perfectly with Krall's bland delivery. Even when she tries to emote on Mel Torme's great composition " The Christmas Song", it sounds disingenuine.  I think of Diana Krall as a product. When a business school grad goes to work at a corporation, they come in with profit as their goal. So whatever product they want to market and sell to the American public, and hopefully the World market, they want to have the most widespread appeal possible. Diana Krall is the Coca Cola Sugar Water of music. Sugary Sweet, a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry. But the vast public wants a CD, i mean, product, that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say, " We love jazz! Here's our Diana Krall CD." Diana's pose on the front cover says it all. Pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless. It's almost a pose of defeat. Even sellouts have their limits

 Considering the reputation of this book, I was quite shocked to read some of the errors it contains with regard to Australia and New Zealand to the extent I cannot take for granted anything else within its pages.  A short list:   1. Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not "food traditions" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts.  All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.  2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.  3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.  4. The "pie floater" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.  5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.  6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing.  Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.  7. In New Zealand, food is not "simple" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration.  In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.  8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!  This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.  I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes. I shudder to think that anyone has 100% faith in this book. Given Larousse's reputation (not to mention price) I expect a lot more. 
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 Methinks, yes, Mr. Sheldon should retire.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought I was reading a Reader's Digest Condensed version of this book.  Most of the twists and turns were totally unbelievable and mostly predictable.  I really used to enjoy Sidney Sheldon's earlier books, but I sure wish I had not wasted time reading this silly book.  
 ... But that's not really saying much. At least the main characters are back in this installment of The Sword of Truth Series.  This one has Richard Rahl, his wife Kahlan, their bodyguard Cara and company still traveling through The Old World. Richard's magical powers are failing, his headaches are back and will probably kill him if he can't get to his grandfather Zedd in time to help him. But then a group of desperate people poison the Lord Rahl in an effort to force him to help them, so now it's a toss-up as to what will kill him first - the Army of the Imperial Order, his gift or the poison. Meanwhile, Emperor Jagang (he's the bad guy) is moving in on The Wizard's Keep and things are looking dire.   Okay, It's nice to see old friends again. Zedd and Adie are here, along with Nathan (one of my favourite characters) and Ann and even Chase and Rachel show up - lots of fun there, but since when did simple, straightforward Richard become such a pompous, didactic windbag? The last few books in the series have been growing increasingly preachy, but in the past it has been other characters doing the preaching with Richard as the voice of reason teaching by example. Now, all of a sudden, he's spouting long-winded sermons about the virtues of hate and vengeance - what's up with that? And then there's Betty, the goat. She was irritating in the last book, but she's just a pain in the rear now. Don't get me wrong, I like goats, but come on - lock her in a pen and keep her out of the way!   I enjoyed some of the story in this one - especially with Zedd and Nathan and Chase, but out of 725 pages, maybe 300 were story. The rest is crap. I loved the frist few books in this series and often re-read them, but after the last two (this one and Pillars of Creation before it), I don't know if I will bother reading the last three of the series 
 We have had 2 of these toys - they both had the same problem as others - only says "red pan in/out"  If you slam it hard on the floor it occasionally will sing, but this is also random.  The fisher-price rep. did not seem surprised when I called to report this - told me to keep the toy I had & sent me a voucher for a new toy.  
 Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings "Lips of an Angel" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus!  
 Shortcut to Nirvana: If you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic India, this is perhaps a good movie to watch. I was dissappointed! This film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the Kumbh Mela. Pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons! These "other diversions" are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations. The story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me 
 I read this book and it confirmed my feelings that USA, as the only super power, should ALWAYS remain STRONG.   The book is composed of some 400 pages full of critiques as if the author wanted America to be the haven of saints when the world has been full of crocodiles, for instance the introduction brings about a fair resume of the author's intentions  How!   In the Introduction I came across a passage which I hereby quote `''It was in the early days of the Vietnam War that a Vietcong officer said to his American prisoner _' You were our heroes after the war, and a common phrase in those days was `'to be as rich and as wise as an American'' - What happened `''.   The title `Killing Hope' - updated edition 2004 - by William Blum, and many of the contents are indeed offensive to the USA because it speaks about U.S military and C.I.A 'interventions' since World War II and endeavours to portray them as the bad guys.  C.I.A (USA) intervensions?   Didn't such 'intervension' save many countries that now live under the 'shades' of democracies, in Europe and the Far East (Japan) enjoying unprecedented richness and prosperity, with a high standard of living for their nationals.  As one individual out of six billion living on this planet, do I blame the USA for protecting the interest of its citizens.  USA is The World Giant and one has to learn how to convince them of one's view points , rather than garrulously defy them with boring speeches and  empty written words. 
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 Digital photography is not yet second nature to Peterson as is film SLR photography.   For example,  Peterson writes "2048 x 3000 ppi (pixels per inch)" instead of "2048 x 3000 pixels"--he just doesn't speak the language yet.      Below, Rennie Petersen on May 19 gives the definitive criticism of this book.  I own this book as well Peterson's other two books Understanding Exposure, which I highly recommend, and Learning to See Creatively, which I like having but is second to Understanding Exposure.  So my review is really summed up in the title. 
 To build upon the reviews as listed below, I will expand on them to say that even with the lastest firmware the issues till exist and Garmin cannot get it fixed.  The hardware radio section is also pitiful and is out of deviation.  But probably the worst part of it all is that after five total sets sent to me from customer service as well as 5 sets returned for various firmware and hardware issues.  Garmin cannot seem to get the quality control correct.  Worse than that is a set that was supposedly CHECKED by a service tech and listed in the report as OPERATIONAL withing spec.  Out of the box was failing....that is terrible customer service and technical help.  I love the idea of the Garmin 530 and would buy two more in a second * IF * they correct all the known bugs and issues with the product.  I do not belive they can and or will and Garmin appears to be in denial about this product.  Stay away from this item until you hear that they have taken the bull by the horns and corrected this product 
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 to be quite frank, he could have done better, the content was informative but his explanation were too wordy and repetative. he could have explained his system thinking theory's in half as much time by sticking to the point,  not adding paraphrases that were confusing and misleading. question is  "does he get paid by the number of words he uses or the  content?" 
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring 
 Parents and children who loved the other Leap Frog DVDs about letters, words and reading will find this one disappointing.   Advertised as beginning math, this one is mixed up in its focus, spending quite a bit of time on recognizing the numbers from 0 to 10 (especially zero) and relating them to “quidgets”, then quickly jumping to addition and subtraction without sufficient explanation or introduction of the concepts.  Starting with simple counting, by the end of the 35 minutes, they’re showing us ten times tables up to one hundred.  Very young children will probably like the repetitive cowboy “numbers” song, and may even stick around for the “circus” acts and accompanying slapstick routines, but the concepts advance too quickly for this age group.  Kids who already know their numbers won’t learn anything new from the beginning of the presentation, but then again, they probably won’t learn anything from the rest of it either.  Clearly one should not expect kids to learn math in 35 minutes, which makes you wonder what they were thinking when they made this one.  A more sensible approach would be to have different DVDs for each level, as they did in the reading series, so that they could spend more time going into the nitty-gritty, and making it fun.  This one is a rush job, and was not properly thought out for the intended audience.  Definitely not a tool you should count on to introduce your kids to math.    Amanda Richards, May 4, 2006  
 This could quite possibly have been the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire existence!  First off...Jim Carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public.(animals included) This movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store...it shouldn't be there.  The only laughs I had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie.  Sure you may come back and say it was a student film...but honestly, where the hell could he or she be a student at!!  Who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity.  Sure the girl was Fat...nbut that wasn't here main problem.  The acted like an idiot all the time and then ALLOWED people to call her BIG J!!  This is a complex written all over it.  This is BIG J calling was always followed by some cheap Yogi Bear impresion...once again retaining back to the fact that she's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear.  Jim Carey didn't even entered this movie untill about 20 or so minutes into it.  And just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film.  I was not impressed and don't recommend this waste o time, film, and brain cells to anyone thing.  Even if no one is watching this movie in your house, Please don't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the TV screen.  MY CAT DIED, WHILE VIEWING THIS FILM.  please heed my warning 
 As a historian of the IWW, I bought this title hoping for something new and insightful.  While the presentation is new, it really suggests what Henry Adams referred to as the devolution of America.  The real IWW did some interesting things with the graphic arts -- none of which are cited or displayed by the author.  While portrayed as a serious history, this is truly a comic book posing as history.  I would not buy it again 
 (Note this, I'm under NDA, so I can't go into details about what the CLP practicum exam exercises are like in more depth and detail.)  Hi! Today I did the CLP practicum. I had used this book for preparation. Not long ago I passed RHCE, Red Hat Certified Engineer exam, so following this book was a breeze. All the Lab Exercises felt easy, aswell as doing the two included practicums. I felt practicum exam 050-069 would be no problem. WRONG! Where should I start, exam 050-069 doesn't exist. CLP certification is gained throug something called Practicum v.2 exam# 050-689. This is an all different beast than anything this book prepares you for. For most of the exercises you only get maybe 10% coverage in the book. The book covers something with one page, but the dept of knowledge to solve the real problem might need 10 pages. In the information here at Amazon, they say this book covers exam 050-069, that doesn't exist. On the back of my book it says it covers exam 050-689. I would say that the only thing this book covers exam 050-689 is the cover. I get the feeling that they made the first practicum exam, and wrote the book at the same time. Scraped the first exam, but launched the book anyway. Smart thing to do Novell... NOT!  Also the plattform they are using for this test is in lack of other words.. plain stupid. You are working with servers throug java and macromedia flash. The latency is atleast 1-2 seconds. Imaging typing something, and everything is lagging 1-2 seconds. You se you misspelled something, and press the arrow a few times, just to discover that you pressed a few to many. Tab doesn't work to "shortcut" commands and links. The resolution is 640x480, so I hope the shell is a good friend to you! Trust me, you will get super frustrated of the poor performance of the test system! One more problem for me was that I'm from sweden, used too swedish keyboard layout, but the test stipulates that you have an english layout. So I'm typing something, just to discover 1-2 seconds lather that I typed something different... oh.. that's right, | and ~ is not where they used to be. You get anoyed having to look at the keyboard all the time to find the right symbols.  So how should you prepare for the practicum. Have this page as your guideline. http://www.novell.com/training/testinfo/objectives/clpobj.html Anything from this page can come as exercises.. in great detail!! Sure, you can use the book, but just as part of your preparation. Do your homework, since Novells book tutering failes. One more thing, the say the test is 2 hours on novell.com. When you login to do the test it says 2,5 hours, and when you start the actual practicum test you get 3 hours. You will need those 3 hours!!  Remember that you need 85% score to pass. (I got 77%, but not thanks to this book.)  One final note is, that I think the RHCE exam is much much more mature as an hands on exam. I get the feeling Novell have rushed something to the market that is far from mature. Sure, you are skilled if you pass the CLP, but if you do the RHCE exam, you'll know what I mean.  Good Luck 
 ...the author ...described some of the recipes as possum stew (she actually uses the animals she runs down on the road) and wasp larvae appetizers.  Unless you have a taste for the extreme and you loved the menu on the Survivor Outback series, you would do well to steer clear from this one.  A good novelty item, I guess 
 If you were raised on Getz, "Bird", Ellington, Hampton and all the other greats, don't plan on enjoying this CD.  While the vocals are OK, none of the tracks are memorable.  I've given it several listens today, but fear that this one is destined to go to the bottom of the stack...........maybe I should have waited until tomorrow, and bought the Sunday Times, but I don't think that would get me in the mood for these Jazz Moods 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 I got this as a gift from a friend who should know better, but I could easily have been suckered by the weasel words the marketing department plastered on the package.  The package says "Hi Speed" USB but I had 670 MB on a 1 GB Cruzer Mini that I wanted to transfer to the new Lexar JumpDrive FireFly.  The upload to my laptop went smoothly - no more than 10 minutes.  Then I took out the Cruzer and inserted the FireFly in the same USB port and copied the directory I had just uploaded to the FireFly via a simple "paste".  It took over an hour (I don't know exactly how long since I had to leave before it finished).  When I got back, I decided to do a test copy of the data back to the Cruzer.  The same data only took 10 minutes to download back to my 1 GB Cruzer.    It seems clear that "Hi Speed" for Lexar means USB 1.0 (about 12 Mbps) and not USB 2.0 (about 480 Mbps).  I'm sure the marketing department said "Why confuse the poor stupid consumers with technichal specs.?"  I searched their website to see if there was more information but the suits seem to have veto power over the web designers as well.  If speed is important to you (and with a 4 GB drive it is logical to assume that you are going to have some large files to move) then steer clear of this product.  1 GB of data will take you on the order of an hour or more to move.    Of course if speed is not important or if you only have 1.0 USB ports on your machine then the product is fine. It works as well as any other flash drive device on the market.  My main complaint is that without testing, it is hard to know that this is only a 1.0 device 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything.  Overall, if you like weird movies like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how "true to life" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one 
 Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair 
 What a wonderful book ODD THOMAS was!  What a total disappointment FOREVER ODD is.  What happened Dean?  Did you have to meet a quick deadline or something and just couldn't come up with an idea?    If you really liked ODD THOMAS don't destroy your respect for it by reading FOREVER ODD.  It is really just a junked up piece up literature to keep the ODD thing going on.    I love so many of Dean's books, but you can always tell when he is just trying to throw a piece of trash out there to meet a deadline.  This is one of them. Save your money.  Don'y buy it.  Go get your original ODD THOMAS book and read it again for free.  Sheesh Dean .... help us fans out a little here buddy !!  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I was expecting to read about what Lewis said in those historic broadcasts.  And why.  But the book is filled with the "how".  Not even the "how" from Lewis' point of view, but the "how" of the BBC staff.  The story is well written and the book flows well.  It just wasn't about a subject I found very interesting, or I should say, it wasn't about the subject I wanted to read about - What Lewis said in those war time broadcasts. Why he said what he said and What impact the broadcast had.  A little of the "how" would have been interesting too.  
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 I rented this movie because I really adore the two lead actors.  However, although they do the best they can, there is no saving this banal, movie of the week-esque movie.  There are a couple of nice moments, most notably when D'Onofrio's character talks about his father and about his love of football.  Other than that, the story seems to be cobbled together from many other "uplifting" movies.  At times, you can not only guess what will happen next, but can guess what the exact line will be.  Football hero becomes self-pitying after an accident leaves him blind (and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack--which she exposes in a tell-all book).  His tutor from school shows up, himself in a wheelchair, and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race.  Even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah-rah, he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver.  But first--you knew it!--they have to learn to trust each other.  This involves whacky stunts.  The two drive to the race, having adventures, learning about themselves and each other, suprising locals with can-do spirit.  Each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset.  Each person they run into is nutty.  And even though I said I liked this, the lines from the scene where Olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from "The Breakfast Club" where the jock talks emotionally about his dad.  Only the commitment of Hines and D'Onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all.  So to recap: Person who's cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself? Check. That person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory? Check. Another person who's been down that same road of self-pity and redemption comes along to save him? Check. Two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals? Yup. Student becomes teacher? Yes. Locals try to keep them down? Check. Other dreamers lend a hand? Drunk driving? Boy stunted emotionally by father? Bathroom humor? Improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders, and won to stirring music and cheers? All those who've been touched by the quest and who we've met along the way show up at the end? Suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what's really important?  Yes, yes, yes 
 Although The flatware is nice looking... I bought these because they claimed it was 18/10 stainless steel, what I received was 18/0. Be aware 
 The picture in the item description shows a dark red, which would have matched our kitchen colors.  Be aware though that these are close to an orange or a very bright red. 
 judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are  lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy  allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH 
 Any band that puts out more than one "best of" or "greatest hits" or "definitive collection" or "ultimate collection" and doesn't include everything on at least one of those releases gets 1 STAR. Period. TH have released several hits compilations and once again "Love For Sale" is omitted. Piss on these record companies and bands that can't deliver a complete hits collection 
 Slavery in our country's history was grievously wrong, wrong, wrong...but this book was dry, dry, dry.  It left out very basic details and was bogged down in the author's repetitive, plodding musings.  My mind would drift trying to get through one paragraph (and the paragraphs are quite wordy.) I wanted to soak up this book and its information.  Unfortunately, it was just too dull and overwrought, and I came away knowing merely a bit more about the New Orleans slave market than I did going in 
 This text book is very bad.  My professor for this class was almost as bad as this book.  I can't believe that Amazon.com sells this book due to the low quality of it.  Don't even buy it used because the authors made this up while they were on drugs because none of the chapters flow and they are lazy and make you refer to other examples that do not even pertain to the question.  I wish Amazon.com let you score lower than a 1 star because this book doesn't even deserve that 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 First off the company I work for ordered three of these.  One out of the three did not work.  There is no sound comming from the right side and it isn't the speaker as we have tried different speakers.  Amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one.  This is just the start.  The two that do work work very poorly.  The connecotor for the iPod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off.  They give you inserts to use depending on what model iPod you have.  These inserts prevent the iPod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the iPod will not work.  Also, the CD player has a lid that opens with a motor.  Yes, a motor.  So, if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don't close all the way.  You need to use the open/close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open.  All of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing.  The sound is not that great at all!  There are a TON of wires with this thing.  Power, speaker, antenna and iPod firewire type connector all run between the speakers, subwoofer and main unit. This is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department. 
 This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck.. 
 This is the only book I returned to Amazon.com. Not because it is poorly written or inappropriate sexual content; it is a well written history of courting evolution. But, this book is also a plodding tome, more a textbook  than a book to focus family discussions as advertised. The USA Today review  explained, "a wonderful anthology.... It teaches a higher form of sex  education--a form that cultivates awe for the depth and breadth of marital  love while showing respect for the fragility of the human heart."  Mostly the book will put you and your teens into a deep sleep. If you love  good books, great books, buy it. If you are looking for a book to help with  discussions with teenagers this is not it 
 This was a disappointing read, to say the least.  For starters, Father Nevins starts with a concept of Fundamentalism which would leave most self-described Protestant Fundamentalists scratching their heads!  Nevins proceeds to "answer" a number of Protestant arguments, some of which would never be posed by any serious Fundamentalist or Evangelical apologist.  Nevins also commits a variety of informal logical fallacies.  (At one point, he even appeals to 20th century usage of an English word to determine 1st century usage of a Greek word!) In the interest of fairness, we should point out that we are not at all sympathetic to Nevins' cause, but we believe that the works of Catholic apologist Karl Keating are far more useful for both Catholics and Fundamentalists.  With no animosity for the author himself, we do not believe Nevins' book was worth the brief time required to read it.  
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 Many of the same oft-repeated distortions that have been thoroughly and completely debunked continue to be recycled in this book. Michaels continues to seek out funding from oil and coal companies to fund his 'research'; how long will he play the role of Don Quixote? Readers will be much better served by reading the findings of the paleo-climate community at realclimate dot org 
 Let me see if I have this straight: The author suggests that women who CHOOSE to stay home and raise their kids should have the same kinds of benefits that those of us who go out every morning and MAKE A LIVING while also raising kids have rightly earned? There is an answer for the problem that the author cites: GET A JOB OUTSIDE THE HOME. 
 Film: 4.5 stars; DVD: 0 stars (DVD released March 2000)  This is a very good - albeit not great - film whose DVD release has been ruined by Disney, as they so often do: - 18(!) minutes deleted from the theatrically released version - non-anamorphic transfer    It's been over six years since the DVD was released.  One can only hope that an un-butchered version is in the works.  However, based on Disney's track record, and on the quality of their marketing "wizards", I'm not holding my breath.  Don't know if Disney licenses to Criterion but, if so, that may be the only way we get a decent DVD release 
 Excited. Popped it in the DVD player. Opening sequence, perfect. Scene 2, no audio. Scene 3&4, had audio. Scene 5, no audio. Do not purchase unless you enjoy: closed captioning, lip reading, or returning DVDs to Amazon 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large.  Pro-war and anti-American people (and certainly anti- Euro-American people), this magazine is truly one to be boycotted.  If you are an American of European descent THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE will more likely be for you.  If you are racially aware and don't wish to see your people vanish from the Earth, I would also recommend THE OCCIDENTAL QUARTERLY.  To give the devil his due, TWS does carry some interesting book reviews at times.  If you love your people, as long as they are not from "the race of the mind," do not buy this magazine, and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund, as I did a few days ago.  Highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections, NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN 
 "Everything...is going to be...all right." (Words of comfort spoken by the ridiculous "Affirmation Doll" showcased on the television show "American Inventor")  This book tells scared people what they want to hear.  Unfortunately, pretty words don't change reality for kids with developmental disorders.  I despise this book because of how much harm it can cause!  Ignoring a gash in your leg won't make it go away, but may lead to an infection.  Denying your child's issues is just as unhealthy, and can cause life-long difficulties.  This book encourages you to compare your child and your family to an Einstein profile, and if the match is there, just relax and wait for your child to grow up and learn on her own.  For some children this course of action could cause them irreparable developmental damage.  My son is 3 1/2 years old and still cannot speak more than the first letter of a word ("puh" for please is about as close to a word as he can do right now).  He fits the profile for an Einstein Syndrome kid, as does our family.  I am an engineer with a math minor who plays the piano and guitar; my wife has a college degree in music, although she considered majoring in physics.  Once you consider our extended families, it's hard to find a family that fits the profile better than ours.  Yet I'm convinced that our son would not have made much of his recent progress if he had not received the attention of the therapists this book tells us to avoid.  Our son has benefited greatly from the early intervention services he has received from caring, knowledgeable professionals.  If I followed the advice of this book my son would be worse off than he is today, and would be even less likely to one day live a "normal" life.  We have witnessed none of the drawbacks of having our son "labeled" with a diagnosis.  His diagnosis has never caused anyone to treat him with any less consideration than they would under other circumstances.  On the other hand, his diagnosis has opened doors to resources that would not have been available otherwise.  If you avoid going to the dentist because you fear he'll say you have a cavity, you might enjoy this book.  If you think you can turn junk food into a gourmet meal by giving it a fancy name, this book is for you.  If, on the other hand, you tend to face reality and to seek help where help is needed, then this book will be of no more use to you than an Affirmation Doll would be 
 This is the first Cussler I have read and I have to admit at being terribly disappointed.I have a liking for books that combine history and fiction (loved The Da Vinci Code) but this has to be one of the least readable in that genre.An important reason for this is that the hero,Dirk Pitt,is an immensely unlikable character.He's too smug,is a walking human encyclopedia who knows EVERYTHING,has all the physical and mental attributes of a God and appears to treat everyone around him with a distinct superiority complex.I ended up smirking on several occasions as his virtue's were extolled upon by all and sundry.Another drawback is the sheer number of characters.New one's keep popping up practically every chapter (and there are 78 chapters in all!).Their names and descriptions get all muddled up by the end of it and one really just stops caring about any of them.As if this weren't enough,there are several plots running parallel with each other and each of these becomes more and more ridiculous as the pages go by.To add to the boredom,detailed descriptions about cars,planes,ships,gadgets etc.are provided at regular intervals.This wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing if it weren't completely redundant.It seems as if the author is merely trying to show off his knowledge about these things.The only reason I finished this book is because I am a completist by nature.I do realise that such books are supposed to be pure escapism and I'm all for such unbridled entertainment - except that there needs to be a method to the madness.This definitely seems like a case of biting off more than one can chew 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 Ive heard the "best" tracks off this album, which include love and mathematics, guilty cubiicle and passport radio and i must say im unimpressed. Its sad background music and by no means anything close to how good you forgot it in people is. In comparison to you forgot it, this album could be a single star 
 I thought it to be a joke book so I didn't like it 
 The Murder Book is one in a long series featuring Alex Delaware, and only the second I've read, and most likely the last.  Kellerman does a good job characterizing Alex and gay friend Milo, but the plot is so full of contrivances and holes that it made this book very dissapointing.  The book opens with Alex receiving a book with pictures of crime scenes in it dating 20 to 40 years old.  Alex calls Milo over to look at it and Milo instantly recognizes one of the pictures in there.  It is of Janie Ingalls, a case he never solved.  Milo then recalls the case and the investigation with his partner Schwinn in flashback style.  Milo and Schwinn are pulled off the case just as they gather some clues and Milo has been bothered by it ever since.  Schwinn has a source who says the Ingalls girl may have been at a party thrown by a bunch of rich kids.  In the present day, Milo and Alex begin investingating the rich kids the Cossacks and their friends Michael Larner and Vance Coury.  It seems like for 200 pages they investigate the rich kids befor the dead Ingalls girl is mentioned again.  The link between the murder of the Ingalls girl and then the long drawn out investigation of the Cossacks and Larners and everything that stems from that is tenious at best.  The book kind of glances over this part at the beginning, indicating Schwinn had a source who said there was a wild party at a house owned by the Cossacks.  Alex and Milo believe Ingalls and her friend may have attended the party but have no proof or real reason to believe this.  My problem is that every step that Alex and Milo take in their investigation is circumstancial, not confirmed by any hard facts.  Milo and Alex do a lot of investigating, but none of their suspicions are ever confirmed by hard evidence.  The trail of crime from the Cossacks is so drawn out its hard to remember at times what the original investigation was.  Also, there is never really any contact with the bad guys at all in the book.  Then, the book ends with the horrible method of long explanation.  Milo talks with a man who basically explains everything to him about what really happened.  Milo knew some of it through his tedious investigations, but the rest is confirmed in the end.  I haven't read much of this series, so I don't know much about the Bert Harrison character.  But it seems to be far fetched that a fatherly figure to Alex could be the psychiatrist to so many main characters in this book.  It seems like a cheap plot device to hand Alex the answers he is looking for.  In the end I was very disappointed because Kellerman is obviously a good writer.  I just don't know what he was thinking when he threw this plot together. 
 For me this was more bland, predictable, basic tracks.  Types of lyrics that been said over and again.  Representing and the like. Nothing significant, maybe one track that threw a spark.  I am highly disappointed and expected so much more.  He kept saying LOW BUDGET and when it sounds like it you don't really need to emphasize.  Repeating your name all over the tracks back to back producer or not is one thing but when you are the artist it is obvious who you are or are you trying to convince yourself you are credible.    I did buy the CD, Mr. Brown,  but I will try to sell it as well 
 I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost.  Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing.   There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters.  Ugh.  I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard.  The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye.  Get a different version 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I returned the product unopened.  It was purchased in error. 
 Why would anyone want to watch a movie about rats is beyond me.  Rats, rats and more rats is what "Graveyard Shift" is all about and for that reason alone, I can honestly say this movie sucks.  But, aside from that, the acting is terrible and the plot is pathetic and stupid.  It is difficult to sympathize with any of the characters especially that boss guy who is a real jerk for sure.   The idea of this huge killer rat is kind of lame in my opinion.  The movie is entirely ineffective as a horror movie as there is absolutely nothing scary about it whatsoever...you might want to vommit after seeing the movie, but you won't be scared.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy this trash unless you like rats, rat blood and guts, terrible acting and a terrible story.  
 ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC! 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 I am very dissapointed with the poor spiral binding on this book, (4th edition)! As a dietetic student, I don't have much money to spend on books as it is. As much as this one is priced, the publishers could have put a higher quality binding on it, (or made it a paperback, like previous editions). Pages are falling out constantly, especially since it the type of book you refer to all the time 
 Let me say that the Dutch is an excellent, but risky, system that should appeal to people who like to "burn their pants" early. In the dutch, there is no such thing as as a loss that is based on one static factor. All losses are SLAUGHTERS. It doesn't matter if your on the white side or the black side. The reason I give this book 1 star is because the Classical Dutch is not the best system to play. When you play the dutch, you want the full point. The Classical dutch doesn't do that. It usually leads to quiet positions where you have good chances in the endgame. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. That leaves to other systems. The Stonewall Dutch and The Leningrad Dutch. The Stonewall is OK. Black is extremely solid and his defense is hard to break down. But the one major problem with it is that there are gaping holes in blacks position, so white usually has the better chances. Now we have the Leningrad. This it it! This system is the most riskiest, newest, and most blood thirstiest system in the dutch. Both sides have to play on there toes , as one slip could cost the game for either side. Endgames are hardly never reached in this sytem for game usually last 30 moves. You have to be on your top at tactics. I wouldn't recommend weak players to play the dutch and especially the leningrad. However, if you are tacticaly good and accurate with your moves and love blood thirsty battles and hate endgames. Then I seriously recommend you get the book "The Dutch for the Attacking Player" by Steffen Pedersen. It provides you with a full repertoire against any thing that white can throw at you using the Leningrad system. All of whites major replies and sidelines are covered in detail with complete games and provides the logic behind the moves. But let me remind you.... The Leningrad is extremely risky. I hope this review has aided you in which system to play. Keep in mind that this is my opinian. If you like a rock-solid wall of pawns then play the Stonewall. If you like endgames and quiet play, then play the Classical dutch by all means. If you decide to play the Stonewall, please keep in mind the gaping holes you are letting white have 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 I'm very interested in homelessness and I enjoy social theory, but this book is far more academic than the description made it seem.  I couldn't get more than 20 pages into it without my head spinning.  If you are looking for something light this book is not the right choice 
 My grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights.  A month later it wasn't working at all.  We thought it was the batteries and changed them, but sure enough nothing was working.  We called Tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them...P.S. I still haven't heard from them and it's been almost 5 months.  It's not worth the money!  I highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lil'firefighter 
 not only because this movie sucks so badly, but because i actually bought the thing.  A suggestion: get the ORIGINAL Maximum Overdrive, based off the same Stephen King story this one is.  MO is much better; in fact, it's one of my favorite horror movies of all-time, and I've seen alot of them.  Overall, if you're a fan of over-the-top campy acting, a storyline that doesn't work as well as the original, and overall a movie that just plain sucks, then my friend, this one's for you.  If you have even one brain cell in your body, then don't buy this Ford P.O.S. (if you can tell me what movie that's from, I'll personally pay you $20...)  You'll be glad you didn't 
 First question: Did we really need another profile of Tony LaRussa, already the most over-exposed manager in major league baseball? Ever since he popped up in the early 80s, the media has fawned over his every move, evidently impressed by his ability to pull a double-switch and glower at the same time. Dude gets more ink than Brad and Angelina -- maybe they share the same publicist.  But if you're as big a baseball fan as I, it's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of (as the title suggests) three nights in August ... i.e., a feeble re-make of 'Nine Innings' spread out over three games so the writer won't have to concentrate as hard. I finished the book in two sittings, so I can't honestly sit here and say that it stank.  Or can I?  The central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject, namely the aforementioned manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one Tony LaRussa -- attorney at law, in case you needed reminding. According to one Buzz Bissinger, LaRussa's an old-school throwback, a balls-out 'real man' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething' geeks who wouldn't know a jock strap from an iPod nano. Yeah man, those guys just sit in front of their computers all day, crunching numbers, but me, Tony L, I go by my gut! I've got 25 years of experience ovah heah, and I make my decisions the old-fashioned way! If the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher, maybe I will, maybe I won't -- I'm going to walk to the mound and SMELL him first. Think those MBA Moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like? They don't even chew tobacco, mang.  Yeah, well, interesting theory. Trouble is, after taking cheap shots at such stat-head losers as Bill James and Theo Epstein, our man LaRussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing pitcher-hitter matchups. That's right -- the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going 3-for-7 against Kerry Wood. What the *&^%? Per Bissinger, we shouldn't rely on statistics -- unless they're based on impossibly small sample sizes.   Another flaw in this anti-number, pro-intangibles screed is that we never actually see LaRussa go *against* his statistics. Seriously. I mean, if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself, shouldn't there be some instances where Big Tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge? or where T straightens out a player with a bad attitude, or picks up a guy in a slump? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet such instances are strangely absent.  Why? Because LaRussa's an arrogant jerk who doesn't relate to his players. Hell, he doesn't relate to his *family* either, as one of the book's better storylines makes plain. The book confirms the prejudices held against LaRussa by his detractors: namely, that he's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat. This negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of *not* making a move, of being second-guessed by the press... or by himself, perhaps? Bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the #8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit, thereby allowing them to have their #1 hitter lead off the following inning. It's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball, but LaRussa treats the issue as if he's launching the Market Garden offensive. Dude, it's the fifth inning and there's still fifty games to go! Pop a Paxil or bolt down some Jim Beam -- you're begging for this guy to relax!  But Big Tony never relaxes -- and his players never will either. Bissinger notes approvingly that LaRussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it's the seventh game of the World Series throughout the 162-game season. As such, his players are forever under the gun, terrified their manager's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third, even if they're playing the Pirates in June. His players will always press, and ultimately, they'll always lose. That's another major flaw in the book: The author presents LaRussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball, while side-stepping the little matter of his failing to win the big one. He's managed for 25 years and has won the World Series exactly once; he's also lost it on three occasions, getting swept twice. Fittingly, he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very stat-conscious maxims that Bissinger aims to debunk. Chew on that, Buzz. (Blaming the loss on a late flight into Boston? Sell it somewhere else, bub.)  The writing, you ask? Let's just say that Boswell and Angell can rest easy. Bissinger's swinging for the fences (!) on this one, desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit. A spate of ill-placed phrases ranging from the Maginot Line to the Hammurabi Code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as "the kind of existentialist hit that would keep Camus or Sartre in the money." Overwrought much? I half expected to spot Vladimir Lenin Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers behind home plate. Add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase HIT-AND-RUN each and every time it appears -- imagine a Neil Young biography that wrote about all his FOLK ROCK BALLADS or a book on Bush that discussed the WAR ON TERROR -- and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story. Bad Buzz, Bad.  What was that story again? Oh right, here it is: Tony LaRussa's a genius because he doesn't rely on statistics like those other guys, except when he does, and you can tell he's sharp because he wins, except when he doesn't.  Did I mention the author gives LaRussa a pass on the issue of steroids, even though Tony's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem? It just goes to show you: Never read a book recommended by Tim Russert, the man who ate Mario Cuomo 
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 This is my grandson's favorite Froggy story. However, the quality of the paper back book is abysmal. Both copies fell apart within 24 hours, with the middle pages detaching almost at once. Children's books must be durable and these are not. Don't waste your money 
 As a college graduate with a degree in economics i bought this book with gusto and enthusiasm.  It was a sad mistake because I felt let down by the quality of the writing.  Soros explains that he is an expert on the subject and able-minded to write such a book because he has sympathy for the future of the world.  I believe that is his only qualification in that this book lacks any reason behind the statements.  Soros makes blatant remarks about US and World institutions without ever providing an example to back it.  I was mostly interested in his SDR's topic but then found that he glazed over it and never fully explained what he expects them to help.  Quite disappointing.  He lacks basic essay writing skills although I am sure some of his other books are up to the standard 
 I've never had such-a-slap in the face biased book presented to me for college curriculum. Very dissapointing 
 "Random Encounter" tries to make Elizabeth Berkeley look like a good actress but it cant be done, sorry.  the story is so-so, and very by-the-book 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 "The Door In The Floor" is difficult to like, even, (or perhaps especially), if you're a fan of John Irving's book, "A Widow For One Year," which was the source of this film.   The movie is dark, depressing, & slow-moving. It also showcases the least likable characters from the book. To make matters worse, it focuses only on the first third of the novel's story, which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated, (& alienating), couple's suffering. The film is completely devoid of the novel's interesting & more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family's life & into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who aren't well developed in the film, but who are central to the book's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story!   This may give you an idea why the film wasn't very successful with audiences.   The theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people. Unfortunately, the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents, played by Jeff Bridges & Kim Basinger, in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons. It wallows in the empty chasm that's grown between them & delves into the sad, meaningless, & even cruel love affairs they each engage in, in vain attempts to ease their sorrows & escape the pain of the love lost between them & of course, the greatest loss, the loss of their sons. The film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose.   And finally, we witness the pain of their very young daughter, who was born out of yet more of the parent's attempts to fill their empty, sad lives, and we're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood, growing up with parents who truly "aren't there."   The greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel, and even worse, why they chose to "bring to life" only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it! If the theme of loss is one you're very interested in, you might find this movie quite affecting.  As for me, a great fan of the book, I can only hope that someday someone makes a better & more complete adaptation of this great book. It's not nearly as desperate & sad a story as this film version!  On subsequent viewings I've grown to appreciate this film a bit more. Taken completely apart from the novel, it's not a "bad" film. Undoubtedly, the performances are wonderful, however little fun they are to watch. 
 a murder of wonderful tonight!   Eric Clapton is god and should NOT be touched by country artists 
 Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.  
 I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this 
 This is Waylon singing Hank.  It isn't his best produc 
 I liked this when it first came out b/c I was 16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.  Favorite song is Mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back Johnny is almost a conventional song. Satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song.  The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS, multi media, making money kind of thing.  I saw them live (they were horrible) during their hey day. The most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can hear the DEVO in all of his work.  Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO came out as a Goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own. 
 Last night I listened to the whole CD on Clear Channel.  (Everyone should deliberately hold off on buying a disc until they hear every song or at least a sample of every song.  It will definitely save you time and money.)  I was sorely disappointed.  There were only three songs on that disc that really resonated with me.  Once In A Lifetime, I Told You So, and Got It Right This Time.  God Made Woman was God awful.  Richard Marx had attested that Everybody rose above Better Life in quality, but I think it was lackluster in relation to Better Life.  Sorry Richard Marx fans, but this song was more Marx than Urban.  Not in a good way either.  The rest of the songs were drowned in heavy production, bland melodies, needless bridges, and repetitive lyrics.  I really expected more from Keith.  I was hoping for more guitar, rather than keyboard and piano.  I was also expecting it to sound like country, instead of saccharine laden pop.  I'm going to stick with iTunes for the tracks I do like and leave the rest by the wayside.  I'm not paying for the whole disc.  I wouldn't want anyone to have to pay full price for this record.     Music is an experimental business, much like movie making or any other type of media art.  It's a gamble really.  Sometimes you can release the best disc of your career.  An album that has one hit after another, with unlimited radio and television airplay.  Then sometimes you can release a dud.  I'm sure in Keith Urban's case, that dud will still earn him a multi-platinum CD, along with all the acoutrements of a "quality" record.  He has a hardcore mob of fans that will love anything that Urban produces, much like Richard Marx. Of course, these days, Urban beats Marx in sales of his own discs, but both artists stay in the same realm of revenue as far as being accomplished songwriters.  You can't dispute the fact that both musicians are very talented in that area.  I have to watch my words though, or some of the fans may want to verbally break my legs when I mention anything less than a perfect review of either Marx or Urban.  LOL!  (Sometimes there is no way to verbalize something so ridiculously funny.  So chatspeak has to suffice.)  Does this mean there is no accounting for taste?  Maybe.  After I wrote this review, I read similar reviews in the Boston Globe, and the Daily News.  You have to look at reviews objectively, but I think that I'm not the only one who sees the flaws.  Yet there is a contrast to those poor reviews.  Billboard, one of the most influential music publications in the world, gave it a rave review.  They said that, "it was fitting that (Keith Urban) ended the record with Got It Right This Time."  Now don't get all upset.  I still love the majority of Mr. Urban's catalogue.  (Marx's too!)  Putting aside the fact that I am a big fan of his work, I just think that Keith Urban's record went too far away from country.  Hopefully any good and bad reviews that he receives from this effort will help in the creation of his next disc.    (You may wonder why I included Richard Marx in relation to this subject, aside from the obvious connection.  From what I have observed, most of the fans that like Marx are diehard Urban fans.  Just like Rodney Crowell fans will tend to listen to Keith Urban, or the same would hold true for Dann Huff.  You connect the relative to prove your point.)  
 What film did the above (or below) reviewers watch? Sheesh, this thing was all ambiguity (which I endorse, but at some point, there has to be some clarification as to what's going on) - the 'end' of the film is not an ending - it jus' stops - and one of the children has dropped dead - why? Ms. Kerr's (by other reviewers much 'lauded') performance is overly theatrical in the extreme - is she losing her mind? is she completely normal? she acts far too convinced of herself to hint at the possibility of the former - the result being that the viewer is left scratching his/her head, wondering what the hell's going on... and the soundtrack (also described as actually frightening) was laughable - apparently reverb was something the sound feller had just discovered for himself and went all out - to be fair, I don't know what kind of an impression the film would've made on me had I seen it for the first time back in 1961 - no doubt numerous members of the film audience then were indeed 'Innocents' compared to these days of explosions and gore. And there were moments of high suspense - definitely - but to have the film simply be cut off, like a slice of salami... Impertinence! *G*  - apparently, the original James' tale leaves unresolved as to whether the governess was losing her mind, or were the children indeed 'possessed'...?   And where's the ending? (say, another 5-10 minutes to tie up any number of loose ends... what happens to Flora after she went to London? what role does the uncle play really? what does he really know?) - an incomplete and frustrating work... but I can imagine that back in 1961, seeing this in a movie theatre, this could cause some chills... I was born in '68, so am a 'latecomer' in that regard...  An interesting cross-reference that I see - some elements that appear here, even specific questions, are used (I think) to much greater effect in Peter Medak's 1979 intelligent 'chiller', "The Changeling" with George C. Scott - the search for the source of mysterious sounds up up up through an old house - finding a music box in the attic - the question: "How did she/you die?" ---  In short - some promising (and suggestive) moments - but all in all, very disappointing and as I've said, ultimately simply confusing - frustrating 
 If you are a Christian and believe in the Bible, then you need to stay away from this book. As the old adage goes, "You can't judge a book by its cover".  The author purports to answer various questions from kids using the "voice of God". However, the "answers" that he gives are not Bible-based and go against the very infallible word of God. For instance (and I paraphrase), when a girl asks the question "Why am I a lesbian?" His answer is that she was born that way because of genetics (just as you were born right-handed, with blue eyes, etc.). Then he tells her to go out and "celebrate" her differences.   Another girls poses the question "I am living with my boyfriend. My parents say that I should marry him because I am living in sin. Should I marry him?"  His reply is, "Who are you sinning against? Not me, because you have done nothing wrong."   Another question asks about God's forgiveness of sin. His reply "I do not forgive anyone because there is nothing to forgive. There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone, do not judge people. People have chosen to judge one another and this is wrong, because the rule is "'judge not lest ye be judged.'"   And the list goes on. Not only are these books the false doctrine, but in some instances, it even quotes the Word of God in error. 
 Graysmith mentions that Arthur Leigh Allen's father was named after the Revolutionary War soldier Ethan Allen who was caught and hung. Wrong. It was Nathan Hale that was hung. If Graysmith can't even get simple history correct how are we supposed to believe the "facts" that he has presented in this highly convoluted book 
 this cd sees the crr's change direction. they've changed so much they no longer sound like the same group. this has a lot to do with the departure of daniel wylie. when he left the group, the band were left with inferior songwriting and now lack direction. they sound like third grade u2 and that's no lie. not even one song on this cd can save it. i'll give 'emptiness' pass marks but only because it's best in very bad company. if you expect to hear the same sound as the classic 'enjoy the melodic sunshine', you will be major disappointed. this record can't hold a candle to 'enjoy'. so it's major, major, disappointment 
 You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them.  
 WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. they have taken a great tv show, which many of us fondly and raped it. this is so wrong headed i don't know where to start,but here goes. 1. why would they make a black man an agent in the 1800's when he couldn't go in many places and would stick out like a sore thumb. because of the race change for jim west this becomes series of crass racial jokes and has no place in a light hearted adventure series. in fact the tv show never stuped to that level,infact it showed that west's greatest villin was the small in size only dr.loveless played by the great michael dunn!he and west were always evenly matched and had great respect for each other,even when loveless was tring to kill him. 2.the changeing of loveless's person to a legless southern general,and once again the race card is used to makeloveless less likeable when on the show you really liked him even if he was a mad ,evil man. well you get the idea this is the reason you should leave some things left unmade or in this case unremade. just the pits ,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, instead by the complete first season of  "THE WILD,WILD,WEST in june of 06 and see what the movie should have been.  
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen. I attempted 4 times, washing the back thoroughly between each attempt, cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth. Once specks of dust touch the adhesive they're there for good and the protector is ruined. I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid! Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in. 
 I purchased this CD expecting something great-- I had heard good things about this group, and had seen them live a couple times. I really liked them, until I got this CD. Definitely not as good as i thought it would be. The vocals were crappy, and there wasnt as much depth to the voice. The music wasnt as heavy or as tight as it was before.  
 This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts 
 Other than defining "rankism", there is not much else to this book. The author spends most of the book defining and giving examples of rankism.  He does not talk much about "overcoming the abuse of rank", as the title suggests he will.  He cites a few examples of where some groups are already making progress, but he does not really say what others should do, except maybe "join together".  On some occasions, seems to be implying that the world is on its way to eliminating rankism, so we can just sit back and wait for this new utopia to come about. He also likes to compare rankism to both sexism and racism.  He suggests that rankism can be eliminated, just like sexism and racism have been.  Huh?  There has been progress made against these other "isms", but Fuller really is living in an ivory tower if he thinks they no longer exist. "Somebodies and Nobodies" does a decent job of pointing out that rankism exists, but does very little to provide answers 
 Morris is worthless and so is his uncreative, lame book 
 I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked "Of Human Bondage."  I know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature?  Not only did I find it dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women!  I'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways.  "Yellow teethed"  "Sallow skin"  "Dirty Hands"  "Tear stained over powdered face", it goes on and on.  I wondered if the author was uncomfortable women?  I looked online for some information about Maugham.  To my surprise I found out that Maugham was bisexual.  He did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.    Instead of this book I'd recommend the following classics:  Beautiful and Damned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Madame Bovary by Flaubert.  At least in these books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.   
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 This product wasn't working and the handle was broken. I don't recommend to purchase this and it's way to much money for it 
 I was very disappointed with this book. Everything that I read has been written and read before. The hints and tips were mostly silly and not helpful to me at all. So far the best book I've read for weight loss tips  is "Thin for Life". I am always re reading and underlining ideas  for inspiration.  I thought this book would be just as good, but was wrong.  I do agree with the author though, that to be successful in weight loss,  you must do your own thing. You cannot lose weight and keep it off unless  you personalize it to your own needs. You cannot follow a diet or weight  loss book to the letter and expect to stick with it. save your money and  just glance through this one at the library.... 
 I just received the CD (12/05). Before I bought the CD I read almost all of the reviews and they whetted my appetite to get this CD.  BIG mistake!  I heard it last night and it is aggravating to sit through.  I love music based on the Scott premise but not Scott's!  With the exception of two numbers, I never heard any of it before.  I never saw a cartoon that featured Scott's compositions (and neither did he!).  I love MUSIC FROM A SURPLUS STORE.  I love LEROY ANDERSON music. I love synthesized music whether classical (Walter/Wendy Carlos, Ray Lynch, Hearts Of Space, etc.) and I started listening to this kind of music in the early '60s with SILVER APPLES OF THE MOON, etc.  I had a ton of strange music LPs, not only electronic, as I love mainly instrumental music.  Delirium In HiFI (Elsa Popping) was one of my favorites so I'm qualified to pass judgement on Scott's "music."  Raymond Scott is his own category and you gotta hate music to like his compositions.  The musicians (members of various Quintets) are top notch but they selected the wrong leader to showcase their talents.  I found myself moving from one track to another seconds into each track and sometimes I wondered why there were track separations!  Finally, this is not a fun CD to listen to and I'm definitely not going to play it again.  I will not recommend it and the best thing you can do if you are still interested in auditioning it is to find someone that has a copy and give it a test drive.  You buy it, though, and afterwards you'll wonder why you bothered 
 This a short story, which has then been bulked up with huge amounts of backstory.  And the back story was better than the current stuff.  I read this because of Margaret's awesome reputation. I will some of her other works because this one didn't grab me, I didn't even finish it 
 I was very disappointed in this book, as I expected a book with at least some insights into religion versus science Instead, we are 'treated' to  someone who never found what he wanted to do so became a Jesuit whose main  and only job now at the Vatican seems to be the keeper of meterorites. Much  of the latter part of the book is simply his personal experience in  Antartica or somewhere, totally unrelated to the book's title or presumed  focus (and the reason I bought it. A real waste of time. And the waste of  what was and could have continued to be an important life 
 This book makes a number of absurd mistakes - sometimes even getting things exactly backwards - which someone actually familiar with the particular topic (such as radar) would find laughable 
 If you speak Spanish, you will be dismayed to hear how bland and shapeless his poems sound in English.  Speaking of bland, the singing and music here is dullsville.  With so many great Brazilian singers, why not listen to some old Joao Gilberto, or Joao's daughter Bebel, or Marisa Monte or Caetano Veloso.  If you want the poetry of Neruda, reading it is more satisfying.  This is a terrible combination of music and poetry. (Later comment: I listened to this cd again and I probably had unfair expectations and was unduly harsh.  It's a pretty recording and Souza can sing...it still all kind of sounds the same, but 3 stars instead of 1. 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 i assumed (silly me) that this would be a composit of the OLD music from the original productions from the late 1970's to early 1980's.    my granddaughter was totally bored, and so were the rest of us.  apparently, this is the "upgraded" version.  don't bother to buy if you remember the originals 
 This book is like so many earlier feminist-oriented gender/rape books, I found it hard to dissect the information from the familiar propaganda.  I don't need to be convinced that the gender bias in our culture adds to the instances of rape.  This has been established time and time again.  How about a fresh way of describing and dealing with this 
 The first 6 dragonlance books (Chronicles and Legends Trilogies) remain for me, the greatest works in Fantasy ever written.  The poor rating I give to this volume is due only to the useless commentary that I so hoped would provide insight into the story.    What the authors merely do is provide offhand comments that either repeat themselves or detail things that I found uninteresting.  I was seeking more detail into what Raistlin had experienced in his journey, ie..what actually went on when Soth and Raistlin first encountered each other in Shoiken Grove.  What did Raistlin face when he entered the Abyss and battled the Dark Queen's army.  Why did the mage council simply not kill Raistlin outright.  Why did the Dragonlance Adventures book have such inappropriate stats for the characters involved in this story.  Alas, none of these were answered 
 Wow.  I read this book a few days ago, and definitely have my own opinion on it.  I thought I would come here and see what other folks are saying, and I'm not altogether surprised.  The first thing that continually surprises me when I read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is, in fact, well-written, if not even brilliant.  There is, of course, no accounting for taste.    What disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship (which suggests a lack in either education or practice) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views.  I urge those of you that see Bush as a righteous man to please "read around."  There are, obviously, dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like God and George W. Bush will not even acknowlege, much less discuss, defend, or justify.  To ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed.  While I do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people, I am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts, or at least allows them to be performed, that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose.  Read other books and you will see.   One subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil.  I am not supporting them or denouncing our own, but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others.  Labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting, but that they fight simply to overcome those who "love freedom."  This is from  page 114 of this very book, (a quote from Phyllis Wheatley) "In every human breast, God has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom."  Here's a 'revolutionary' thought: Everybody loves and wants freedom.  If people are fighting they are fighting for freedom, we simply must ask one question: Freedom from what?  Read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question.  Also, see if you can discover, honestly and objectively, the freedoms that we are currently fighting for.  Another huge bother for me in this book is that Kengor refers to Texas as the largest state in the nation.  It's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement.  Another horrific, to my mind, thought is that Bush, and lots of his followers, truly believes that God wants him to be president.  A megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an "I'm on a mission from God" world view scares the hell out of me. 
 I enjoyed the first 2-3 Covington books but this will be the last one I read.    The dialogue is so contrived, they don't sound like real people.  Also, since I've read the previous books, all of the recapping--especially when the characters themselves do it--is tedious and boring.   One reviewer (on the cover of this book) compared Jan Karon's books to Ms. Medlicott's, which is a great disservice to Ms. Karon.  Jan Karon's writing and character development are far superior to the Ladies of Covington books!  I also find it discouraging that the Covington books are labeled by some as Christian fiction, since one of the main characters is having sex out of wedlock and another is married to a man but living with two women friends.  These situations are not what I would endorse as Christian living 
 The author has a warm, inviting style, and her personal anicdotes are very nice to read, but her information just wasn't very useful to me. I was hoping for more of an educational (how to, if you will) style, but even with the firm assertation in the beginning of this book that she IS WICCAN, not Native American, she doesn't really approach the information from either way. People don't like it because they say she thinks she is teaching Native ways, but she isn't. She just could have organized her information better, and settled on which religious approach she was going to write from. I was interested in studying Shamanic practice for quite a while, but have finally become disgusted with what seems to be the general attitude the Native American shamanic community has towards Wicca and Pagans. Irregardless of if you do or do not have Native American ancestry, if you practice Wicca, you're a wanna be not worth the air you breathe. Please 
 This toy is very cute but it stopped working after one week. The handle was also very hard to turn to get the music to play.  This was a real waste of money 
 I've dared to challenge my cinema-going art student friends and uni-mates, amid heated discussions about David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and such, by confessing that I really didn't like Magnolia at all.  I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well-rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.  The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances - but in the end, I really felt Magnolia fell short of something more substantial.  It dragged on way too long, the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and I felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial.  There were twists and diversions that didn't really add anything and overall I felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced.  It didn't really have the sort of message that I couldn't have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic, arty stuff came across as pretentious film-student stuff.  I think PT Anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self-indulgent.  I don't think he's very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray.  With the exception of the performances by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise, I thought this film was terrible 
 Bennett's own logic undermines itself. He is in essence arguing that to be a truly patriotic American, one must check your brains in at the door and unquestioningly accept everything our government tells us. Welcome to the machine.  Our country was founded on the premise that individuals should have the capability to think for themselves and critique those in power. It's time that we rediscovered that to appropriately confront those in power is true American patriotism 
 This was the first Bob Dylan I ever bought.  I remember the reviews being rather poor, but I still wanted to hear it.  Even back when I first got it, I didn't think it was the greatest, but I liked playing it anyway.  That is, until I got other Dylan albums, which were far superior to this.  This is not Dylan's worst (Self Portrait, Dylan, Knocked Out Loaded, and Down in the Groove can qualify for that), but it isn't very good.  There are some great tracks (Every Grain of Sand and the title track), some good (In the Summertime, Heart of Mine, and Lenny Bruce), and some godawful (Trouble, Watered Down Love).  It boggles my mind a bit that some of the tracks from these sessions (which later appeared on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 3) didn't make the final cut.  The songs Angelina and Need a Woman are far superior to anything on this album (especially Angelina, which I think is one of Dylan's most mysterious and beautiful songs).  The song Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar is very good, but it wasn't included on the original vinyl pressing.  It was added years later (and is on this CD).  Some of the lyrics are drivel (especially for Dylan).  Luckily, Dylan's next one, Infidels, is a vast improvement.  So, aside from being my first Dylan album, there's nothing really special or interesting about it.  Just a footnote in the Dylan catalog...     
 Gilligan's Island was a fun 1/2 hour for me when I was a kid when I came home from school, but as an adult, it is painful to watch.  If you have seen one episode, you have seen them all.  Each episode revolves around some outlandish plot to escape the island and is filled with the same lame pratfalls of Gilligan that lost it's charm after the virgin time.    There are better tv sitcoms that deserve to be re-visited, Gilligan's Island is NOT one of them 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 I thought some of the songs performed on this CD were nice, but I am giving it a 2 because there were several tracks with a vocalist who sounded as if he had a cold, or a closespin on his nose! I found it very annoying to listen to. Anyway, I've heard better renditions of all these songs 
 Sure, the retail price for the four CDs together is $240 so $180 sounds like a good value. Except that Amazon is selling the first three CDs at $30 apiece and the fourth at $41 which only adds up to $131. Why in the world would someone pay an extra $50 just to buy all four at once?  The CDs themselves are great - no problem there. I just think someone in the Amazon marketing division went a little wonky with this pricing and no one has caught it.   Seriously - save yourself some dough. Until the price for all four CDs drops below the cost of buying them separately this is NO bargain 
 first off 1 star because you can't give no stars!! THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST AND SILLY HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE . IT REALLY STINKS AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BOTHERED TO PUT IT ON DVD. NOT SCARY,NOT FUNNY, JUST THE WORST!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 First the good points:  This book is quite well-written, and an excellent overview of many competing "therapies" for autistic children.  Both myself and my sister have worked extensively with autistic children, and we have family members who suffer from both autism and Asperger's syndrome.  But....  This book is EXTREMELY biased--and sadly, not altogether true.  The Lovaas method is praised as "recovering" children from autism, and though Mrs. Maurice repeatedly states that her children are "recovered," from the evidence she herself provides, it's fairly clear her children were not "autistic" to begin with.  It seems that while her daughter may have had some mild-to-moderate form of developmental disorder, she was obviously not autistic (and the idea that her daughter "recovered" in a matter of mere months is ludicrous).  Even sillier is the story of her youngest son, who does not seem to have developed any indications of autism beyond being a late talker.  It seems as if Mrs. Maurice found doctors who told her what she wanted to hear, and then became obssesed with "recovering" her children.  Clearly her daughter benefitted from the early intervention, but Maurice's story lacks credibility.  For those who have children with true autism, Mrs. Maurice's story of a "miracle cure" will prove more devastating than encouraging.  (A particularly tragic story of a woman named "Lucille" is appended to the book, who upended her family's life to enroll her autistic son in a Lovaas-based program--partly on Maurice's advice--and whose son has so far made little progress).  There are autistic children who do become very high-functioning, even mainstreamed, but deficits remain.  That Maurice's children "recovered" so fully and rapidly is proof that they were never autistic to begin with.  At her interview with her child's behavioral therapist, she states decisively, "Anne-Marie IS going to recover."  Of course--since she'd already decided in her mind that her daughter was autistic, it was easy enough to then declare her "recovered" a few months later.  Maurice seems not to understand that autism is a "spectrum" disorder, and she accepts as faith that it is a completely neurological disorder.  Much like depression, autism can have either biological or psychological causes, and the root cause is not always so clear.  At one point she notes "Failed bonding is a result of autism, not the cause"--but again, this isn't always true.  Even more biased is her presentation of the various alternative therapies for autism.  She rejects all medication therapy; various nutritional approaches (such as those for food allergies and Vitamin B) are briefly raised and then dismissed.  Her extreme prejudice towards holding therapy belies her own statement that she believe it to have some "real" if "limited" worth.  She paints Dr. Martha Welch as a dangerous flake, a gross libel.  Dr. Welch may well have been a bit New-Agey for her tastes, but I have seen children benefit enormously from it.    Even more dishonestly, she viciously pans Virginia Axline's seminal "play therapy," which has stood the test of time and which, again, I have personally seen the benefits of.  It is true that behavioral therapy has an excellent track record in terms of helping children become higher-functioning, but no one therapy is a "magic bullet."  In my experience, children benefit from an integrated program which includes behavioral, speech, play, and nutritional therapy (and very often also medication, though the author does not explain her animosity toward it.)    Lastly, though I am not indicting the author for being rich, she blithely ignores the fact that the average parents (not working on a Wall Street, not a nonworking wife who has a full-time nanny anyway, not living in a fancy Manhattan prewar co-op, etc.) cannot afford to have this type of intensive treatment brought into their homes, and must instead become advocates for their children within the local school system.  Maurice does supply some valuable information on the appeals process with schools  and HMOs.  But if you are the parent of an autistic child, think again before reading this book.  It will likely hurt your feelings, and what good information it provides is readily available elsewhere.      
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 This book may be useful if you have only a modest amount to lose and know very little about weight loss.  In that case, the advice here -- fill up on vegetables, don't skip meals -- may help you reach your goal.  But, for anyone who has a more serious weight problem, this book may do more harm that good.    Some of the book's advice is so overambitious, it's ludicrous.  For example, the author claims that a good daily exercise goal to shoot for is 20,000 steps of walking, which she notes is about ten miles. She claims this takes about an hour. Just how unrealistic is it to expect dieters to walk 10 miles in an hour?  Very -- it's faster than the WORLD RECORD for race walking.  The book's advice is often contradictory.  Early in the book, the author says that people under the age of 18 should not try to lose weight.  Later on, she says that they should.  At other times, the advice is also lacking in detail. She says one should cut back on fat, but then says eating a little fat with each meal helps stave off hunger.  How much fat is "a little"? She doesn't say.  One section that was very interesting was the part about bariatric surgery.  The descriptions of the surgical procedures and of likely long-term side effects would be quite useful for anyone contemplating this drastic route to weight loss. However, even here the book contradicts itself.  First, the authors says that people undergoing this procedure can expect to lose 30-40% of their starting weight, which would take a 400 lb person down to about 250 lbs; later, she says they can expect to lose 60% of their starting weight -- which would bring a 400 lb person all the way down to 160 pounds.   Perhaps most importantly, the author heavily emphasizes how unhealthy it is to be even slightly overweight, but barely mentions research showing that losing a modest amount -- 10% of starting weight -- has huge health benefits.  This book may leave seriously overweight people thinking that improving their health is hopeless.  In summary, this book may be a useful starting point for people who are just learning how to diet, but is likely to frustrate and discourage anyone with a serious weight problem.   
 This book is a wonderful celebration of the strength and lifetime beauty of the some marvelous women.  Their images and insights give encouragement to women of all ages that "the best is yet to come."  This would be a great book for a discussion group.  I first saw it in my doctor's office.  The best part of the book is that it is real 
 I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.   The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her "supposed insights" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.   The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.   Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the "Mummy" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.   Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb. 
 Like so many others, this movie struck a raw nerve with me regarding the graphic detail that was enacted by then 12 year old Jena Malone.  Although the movie has a point to make about child abuse and sexual abuse, I, as the mother of a 13 year old, can not understand how another mother could stand by and watch her child being filmed in such graphic detail.  I could not watch the whole movie as the car scene was so disturbing I turned it off.  What is the difference between a child being molested, and a child actor who is sitting in the lap of a grown man?  Why are the laws different for Jena?  Yes, these types of movies have a point to make, but sacrificing the innocence of another child is not the way to do it 
 It took so long I had forgotten I had ordered it and almost bought it at a book store! Beyond that, the cover was horribly bent and torn, it was yellow, the spine was nearly shattered from use, and it wasnt even the same edition I ordered! Ugh 
 THE SOUND IS BAD. I HAVE TRIED THIS DVD ON 2 DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 I like languages but, in general, I have little regard for phrase books. Occasionally, though, they can prove useful. This one is less useful than usual.  The title made me think in terms of "just getting by". Since that's about all phrasebooks are good for, it is accurate in this respect. Making out, however, has a different meaning in this title. It refers to making out in the sense of a couple of teenagers in the back seat of a car. This takes up relatively little space in the book; it's just a section toward the end. Most of the book is a garden variety, less comprehensive than most, phrasebook.  All of 6 pages are given over to grammar and teaching the script. The remainder is a compendium of phrases grouped according to topic. Some of the phrases are useful. Most are less so. As a man of the cloth, "I don't like wearing a condom" is not a subject which comes up, so to speak, very often.  This will not teach the language. Phrasebooks are not useful for that. This one will not present much in the way of useful phrases either. 
 The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed.  The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group.  It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda.  As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide.  etc. etc. etc 
 Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field.  I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut.  I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer.  I  do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them  to write.  This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped  it would give me some insight.  I didn't.       The conversations, at  times, are interesting.  But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the  79 pages.  If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and  not whined.  If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted  over 10 bucks 
 I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection) 
 As an "expat housewife relocated to France" (as so delicately stated by another reviewer), I found this book somewhat informative.  It is hard to get past her obsessive romance with the French and their culture.  I think her infatuation with the French makes her writings very biased and not very accurate.  I felt like she was looking down her nose at the rest of us Americans that live here and maybe don't appreciate French cuisine with the same gusto as her.  That's great she loves stinky cheese and blood sausage.  Kudos to her for completely immersing herself into this way of culinary living.  However, globilization really HAS reared its head in France and contrary to what Ms. Welty says, the French DO eat cheese singles, snack on chips and very often eat a sandwich for lunch.  The French are not all the same as she makes it seem.  Sure, they love a good, long, hearty 7 course meal now and then, but in the age where a single income family is practically unheard of, I have yet to meet a family that sits down for the "traditional" home cooked lunch AND dinner everyday as she claims most do.  Most disappointing was her husband's commentary that was put at the end of every chapter.  This guy doesn't do good things for the French image.  He has got to be the most pretentious, arrogant, French man I have ever heard of.  Please, do not think the French all feel this way about us!  He just represents one man...not the entire country!  In summary, this book does clear up some of the culinary differences and a few of her recipes are good.  However, her pretentious tone and frequent generalizations really spoiled it for me 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 My son got this for his birthday.  He used it once, and somehow bubbles got into the inner mechanisms and it stopped working.  Even after removing the batteries and letting it dry out, no dice.  Not sure if there was a leak in the bubble dispenser, or it was just poorly made, but my son only got one use out of it 
 The Sluggers Club is an okay book, but I think it is pretty boring. It has an exciting beginning and ending though. Most baseball finds would enjoy it 
 I got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look. After eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke.We are not overweight people (140-190lb). Very sad that we have to replace them, because we were happy with appearance 
 I did not receive the correct item I sent the item back for a return. The picture shows what I wanted but got something else. So I can say I was disappointed. I received some kind of chamisole instead. 
 Needless to say, this set is missing some of my favorite unsolved murders from the show.  But I found that a lot of those that were included were ones I'd never seen, and there are only a couple segments that I personally don't think should have been included.  The last segment of the set, for example- the one entitled "Campus Calamity"- hardly seems to even rate as a local news item.  It just seems like a segment for a dreadfully slow week at Unsolved Mysteries.  However, the reason I can't strongly recommend this set to anyone but fans is the puzzling poor quality of the picure in many segments.  The most egregious example of this is for one of the most interesting segments, "Friends to the End".  The picture grain is simply atrocious in it's entirety.  I can't understand why the transfer for a dvd of such a recent, highly regarded show wouldn't be utterly pristine.  They can't say they didn't have good source material, right?  Most segments have some incidence of grain and blurring.  Sometimes the picture is about as clear as you would expect.  I've read that the other sets have a similar problem.  But, if that's not wholly important to you...  Some comments on the various segments:  Trailer Terror- Just one of the stories in the set that deals with an apparent police conspiracy and/or police incompetence.  Quite shocking.  Journalists Murder-  This very interesting spot on the apparently staged suicide of journalist Danny Casolaro really gives the set some needed integrity.  This is a well known story to conspiracy buffs.  Backyard Bones- One of the weirder cases; yet in the commentary it's revealed that this one is a little less of a mystery than previously supposed, though far from cut-and-dried.  World Leaders- This one probably doesn't belong here, but most will find it fairly interesting.  Burned Evidence- Another case in which the police are suspect, though not suspected alone.  Appalling.  Plane Crash Sabotage- This one seems a little misplaced; yet there is no denying it's a mystery.  Bordello Murders- One in which in which it can reasonably be assumed that a police officer perpetrated the crime.  Not that he'll ever be brought to justice...  Dakota's Double Death- One of the weirdest murder mysteries I've seen.  You could write a speculative horror story about it.  Zodiac/Unabomber- Did you know there were parallels between these two murderous figures?  Probably the neatest segment.  Two other things that disappoint me: Some of the best segments don't get a commentary (only 1 of 4 do).  Also: Why are there any *solved* mysteries on the disc at all?  That seems like kind of a waste.  Surely, the UFO & ghost sets don't have any "solved" mysteries.  If they put all the solved mysteries on one set, do you think anyone would buy it?  Frankly, I'd just recommend watching the reruns if you want to see these segments, as well as all of the ones that are notably absent.  Send a message to First Look (the company responsible for the sets) that we want a better product than this.  What's the point of buying a dvd that doesn't look as good as the show does on cable itself 
 I'm sorry, but this is horrible. I'm a big JSBX fan, but this CD has bad rhythm and completely unintelligible lyrics. They must have been on... Don't buy it. If you like music that's really weird on purpose, buy Pink  Floyd instead of this. You can get all their other CD's, but please not  this one!  I can't believe other people gave this a 5 star rating. They  must see the world a lot different 
 As noted by other reviewers, these films are not restored from film, but from poor video sources. The clowns in the `documentary' even admit it, if you listen carefully. The part of the commentary that I could stand was poorly prepared and repeating the obvious. Since `The Trial' is the much more interesting film of this double feature, I regret having preordered this release instead of buying the appearantly better other DVD release of `The Trial' .. 
 What a waste of time this flick is!  This has to be one of the worst films ever made by a director with a modicum of talent.  I guess director Peter Bogdanovich was trying to deliver a Valentine to New York and thirties screwball but all you get is ennui.  The story meanders and is outright incoherent.  If you watch this to understand the Dorothy K. Stratten mystique I would direct you to "Galaxina" instead.  Better yet is to see "Star 80", Bob Fosse's account of Stratten's life. 
 I wonder if Russell and Andrea Yates read this book? dont be fooled by the number of positive reviews for this book. I think this simply is an indication taht people who espouse this theology are more likely to be vocal about it than people who think its a bunch of hogwash and prooftexts. 
 I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all 
 I purchased both this title and "The Insider's Guide to Real Estate Investing Loopholes" (same authors).  I have two primary complaints.  The authors talk down to the reader, constantly making snarky comments that imply that if one doesn't act NOW, the reader is lazy, or paralyzed, or is somehow inept when it comes to business.  That's not just annoying -- it's weird, and it made me suspicious of the authors' motives.  That brings me to my second complaint.  The book lacks balance.  I'm not saying that all of the strategies can't work -- just that it requires an ideal set of market conditions for them to work.  We need to see low or declining interest rates, quickly rising tenant incomes, improving neighborhoods, distressed or at least disinterested sellers, few other investors, low insurance costs, and a plethora of service providers (such as roofers) who do great work at a low price very quickly.  I can tell you that we don't have any of those factors at work now.  What we do have, at least in areas like mine, where appreciation has outpaced incomes, is a market turned on its head.  Sellers will not sell because they are sitting on huge profits for the most part, and don't have to sell.  Or, they believe that prices will appreciate at the same ridiculous rate that they did from 2001-2005.  Numerous Dolf-inspired investors have flooded the market and bid prices up beyond all reason.  Workers are in debt and don't have much money for rent.  Neighborhoods where deals are affordable aren't improving, so the idea of refinancing because you painted and put up a new mailbox won't help you.  Easy mortgage money has gotten anyone with a pulse into homes.  Interest rates are rising, not falling.  Insurance is costly and the coverage stinks.  And most importantly, rents do not provide positive cash flow for most small real estate investors.  I know several who actually consider themselves to be successful and the news is not good.  They are carrying their properties, their properties are not carrying them!  I know, it's hard to believe that this is success.  But in the past few years, appreciation has bailed them out.  Put that kind of leverage into effect and you are leveraging a negative, which only means you go broke faster.  A few observations:  First, if making untold riches were this simple and this obvious, then so many people would attempt to do so that it would suck the potential profit from such deals down until the actual profit is more equivalent to the amount of work involved.  (More about this in a moment -- because I believe that this is actually occuring in part due to all of the real estate evangelism going on.)  As they say on Wall Street:  "When enough people find the key to the market, someone changes the lock!"  I believe that most people reading this review are smart enough to know that markets are dynamic.  Outrageous profits bring in a flood of new entrants, dramatically reducing the profit potential.  If a whole bunch of new wannabe real estate tycoons start lining up to bid on properties, then the prices for those properties will rise, as will the price for the money (the financing charges in the form of interest rates).  Even without a lot of new entrants, if enough people start using the same financial techniques of leverage, cost-benefit analysis, or tax strategies, then the advantages to be gained will be reduced commensurately.  Common sense and basic real-world economics dictate that costs will rise and potential profits will fall.  And so it is in the real estate world.  Economies of scale and technological advancements have changed many industries and wiped out others.  The ability for a small business person to get a competitive bid on anything is severely limited, whether you are talking about insurance, waste collection, land, communication services, landscaping, or anything else.  Big players have the advantage in negotiations and will consistently be able to lower their costs below that a single investor.  They can offer their tenants more amenities and constantly remodel and update their units at a far lower cost than you or me.  I can't start a profitable shipbuilding company or TV network, nor can I jump into owning large buidings over which I can spread my costs enough to justify what is increasingly becoming break-even or negative cash flow from tenants.  I am not saying that there will never again be opportunities for small real estate investors to use leverage and tax advantages to make decent money.  Just that, with so many of your fellow investors looking to do the same thing, you are not going to find (DEEP BREATH HERE!): underpriced positive cash-flowing properties in undervalued neighborhoods with great potential on which you can quickly close at a dynamite interest rate that result in quickly-rented units with stable, high-earning tenants who are happy to stick around so you can quickly refinance at "massively increased property valuation" (Dolf's expression) so you can pay yourself and your investors back, raise rents even higher and go on to the next property with similar ideal parameters, plunk 10% down and do the same thing.  And no, I'm not an unmotivated individual who works harder than I have to, doesn't understand the value of money, or doesn't want financial freedom.  We all want that.  In Dolf's world, there are numerous individuals who can't wait to to sell you $100 for $50.  My question is, if he knows how to get people to do that, why he is telling us about it?  I think we all know the answer to this question.  Don't get me wrong:  Eventually, the property marketplace will right itself and investment properties will come up that offer opportunity to even small investors, even with the odds stacked against you.  However, it won't unlock some kind of magical door to riches.  It will simply be one of many investments that helps you build LONG-TERM wealth.  Real estate is just another business that goes through cycles and isn't necessarily any more of a path to fabulous riches than owning a chain of gas stations or making molded plastic products.  By the way, the most successful real estate investment firms in America have had a total return about 23% annually for the past five years through March 31, 2006.  That includes dividends and share price appreciation.  If that's the BEST they can do, (and I'm not saying it's bad...it's actually an amazing performance!), it's  because that's the BEST anyone can hope to do, including you and me.  Remember, these firms use all the leverage they can muster and have tremendous economies of scale, and the smartest tax accountants and attorneys working on their behalf.  We are highly unlikely to see this performance repeated in real estate for the next five years or possibly, ever.  Footnote:  I recently studied single family homes in Broward County and Palm Beach County, Florida.  Over the past thirty-five years, not including taxes of any kind, residential properties have enjoyed an average annual return of 9.25% per year.  Short-run performance tends to regress towards the mean.  Therefore, we are virtually assured that real estate will come nowhere close to its recent performance over the next several years, particularly in a higher-interest rate environment with lots of new supply.  Buyer beware 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 Read this book and see Christian zealotry at its worst.  Let's see, we have two amazingly naive girls who want to help the needy and change the world.  Hey, that's good.  Hummm, well, there just are not enough needy folks here in the US, so let's be world travelers!  Yeah, that's the ticket!  More, let's go where it is illegal to preach our religion! Yes, let's live dangerously!   More still, let's endanger folks who are so poor they consider clean water a gift and let's preach our illegal stuff to them.   These two nitwits are shameful, silly, and - make no mistake - dangerous.  Their selfish acts endangered innocent people - poor, destitute people.  Sadly, when one considers that they were treated as "heroes" upon their rescue (which endangered military personnel), we are in bad shape and things are getting worse.  Thank God that we are not a theocracy ............... yet.      
 is this a cover of Social D's sick boy?  and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs 
 There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first 
 First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call 
 This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.    The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money!  
 This book was written by an academic, and it shows. It's about as much fun reading as a college textbook. Even the title's pretentious. Most of the book is composed of short essays on each episode through season 8. I agreed with only half of the author's opinions. She was particularly harsh with "Birthright" and "Sacrifices" because they didn't sufficiently promote a feminist agenda. The denseness of some of the essays is just exhausting. After criticizing most aspects of a particular episode, the author concludes: "A Hundred Days is built on moments; like a string of pearls, each follows another, each with a different sheen but forming a whole. Ellipsis is a huge factor in the episode--not only in time, but in what remains unsaid. Each moment has significance, and it's on these increments that a story is constructed." Well, OK, then. The author also snarked on Keith Topping's fun "Beyond the Gate" (another unofficial SG-1 episode guide), which was unnecessary. There's an inadequate table of contents and no index, so it's difficult look up a specific episode. After slogging through descriptions rife with terms like "binary opposition," "tropes," "didactic," and "metonymy," I felt the same frustration Jack does when Sam starts to explain her science--just get to the point already 
 out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny.  This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even  trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums,  Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel 
 One of the foundational qualities of the Bible is its clarity (sometimes called perspicuity). That means Scripture's main teachings are plain enough to be understood without the need of special expertise or church-sanctioned interpretations.  The Bible frequently speaks about its own clarity. Psalm 119:130 says, "The unfolding of Thy words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple." The average person who humbly reads the Bible can say, "I have more insight than all my teachers, for Thy testimonies are my meditation" (Psalm 119:99). Psalm 19:7 teaches, "The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."  The idea of hidden codes in the Bible contradicts all of that by limiting accessibility to the real message of the Bible to so-called experts who can decipher the cryptic messages God "hid" in the Scriptures. But such "experts" aren't needed because the Bible contains no hidden codes.  One hidden-code theory works like a common word-search puzzle-hidden messages are supposedly embedded diagonally within the Hebrew text. But that's as foolish as turning your daily newspaper into a word-search puzzle and expecting to find meaningful stories hidden in it. Newspapers aren't written to convey messages in secret code, and neither was the Bible. Both should be read using ordinary rules of language.  Of course there are concepts in the Bible that are hard to understand-even the apostle Peter admitted that (2 Peter 3:15). But the way to discover the meaning of those hard passages is not by seeking out hidden messages, but by engaging in diligent study that accurately handles the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15).  Take heart! The Bible is clear and even the most untrained reader can understand it. God wants you to understand the Bible, and He has provided the Holy Spirit as a guide (John 16:13). After all, "man does not live by bread alone, but...by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD" (Deuteronomy 8:3). 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 Is there anything more destructive to a movement than a sense of historical inevitability?  Just ask the Soviets, every time they screwed up they told themselves don't worry, our triumph over capitalism is inevitable, Marx said so.  I fear in this last election the Dems had a milder case of the same illness, a conviction that demographic changes would benefit them no matter what they did or said.  It didn't work out that way.  I first bought this-- in hardcover, alas-- just before the 2002 elections.  It seemed like a bad joke then, but I started reading it again just before this election, which saw the Republicans take control of the White House, both houses of Congress, a majority of governorships and everything but the Lake Tehachapi Water Authority, apparently.  It proved to be more than a bad joke-- there is a lot of good analysis here, some of which supports their trendlines for the Democratic party gaining ground demographically, but the authors are apparently blind to the fact that every three sentences they are forced to say something like: "Although Reagan did win 84% of the vote in the Democratic stronghold, that was due to the one-time effect of new processed cheese regulations, and the overall trend remains powerfully Democratic."  After a couple of chapters you've heard so many apologies and excuses that it's a bit of a joke-- the relentless upward sweep of the Republicans since 1964 is a series of flukes, while the narrow victories of Bill Clinton-- put into office twice only because Ross Perot ran to his opponent's right, splitting the majority right-- are proof of the dominance of the Democratic party.  Underneath all this there may well be some demographic truth.  But it will take some serious soul-searching on the part of the Democratic party to take advantage of it, and this book offers excuses, not a roadmap 
 For me, this encyclopedia has a  misleading title in that most of the entries deal with vampires or vampire-like creatures. There is some material on werewolves & other shapeshifters and skinwalkers, but I found myself wondering where those 'Other Monsters' were. The author dedicated several pages to the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' television series and the author Anne Rice while only giving a nod to classics such as 'Carmilla' and not even a mention of the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' - and the only mention of Dr. Frankenstein or his monster is an entry for 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. There are also entries for Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley - people who may have been involved in the occult but who were hardly monsters. Noticeably absent, especially in the presence of vampire and monster -portraying actors, is Vincent Price. Overall, I can only recommend this book in good conscience if you're a vampire fan. Otherwise, it will only disappoint 
 Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best 
 I was interested in the gigabeat, since I did not want to have to conform to IPOD.  The reviews were good.  First problem is the battery life is advertised at 12 hours...try 6.  I saw an article that said that 12 would be optimal conditions...my battery drains in 24 hrs if not plugged in.    Next problem...one day, I plugged in and started and all memory seemed to get wiped out...after discussing with Toshiba phone support (very friendly and helpful), the firmware was no longer valid.  Sent back to Toshiba and all was working. Less than a week later now, I just started up again and now all my info is removed again...this is all within a month 
 Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling "Byzantine" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman 
 I returned my Banshee stereo. It sure was loud, however the music seemed to wave in and out.  You cannot charge your iPOD either.  There is no remote.  There is no battery compartment - not portable at all.  There are many other choices for less price.  Save your money and look for something else 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one. 
 This book should has little to do with repairing computers. If you want to know how a monitor works, how to take a digital image, or set up a computer surveillance system it does a good job of expaining this and how the stuff inside the computer works. If you've been around computers a while you probably will know a lot of this.   The book has 20 pages on diagnosing and repairing computers and 25 pages on building one; this is explained very vaguely.  If it didn't cost so much to ship it back, I would return it.  
 I bought this to help me eat right while pregnant.  i have been a vegetarian for years.  i wanted to make sure I was getting the perfect nutrtion for my growing baby.  The book is pretty informative.  It does contain shopping lists and tons of recipes.  I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house.  I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers.  I guess I am just not much of a cook.  I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted.  I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive.  If you love cooking this book is great, if you are looking for simple recipes or info on vegetarian pregnancy, seek out another resource 
 I would very much like to resist the temptation to call him a buffoon, but clearly Mr Pinter was.  His play demonstrates a man so obviously isolated from what he was writing about, that he was writing for the sake of  shocking someone.  That's clearly not the point of literature.  Banish Max,  Ruth, Lenny, Teddy, Joey and that godawful Sam to Hades.  Finally, I'd like  to end with a priceless quote from a rather senile acquaintance of mine,  Michael Cristobal Fletcher, who remarked in a lecture that Teddy is  "basically a nice bloke", to which someone replied "even  though he did sell his wife into prostitution?".  Cristobal was  baffled, morosely 
  Like the last guy said, Nothing Sacred is such a bad@$$ hard rock song it makes you wonder what these guys were thinking when they threw the rest of the album together. There's a few hard rock/metal attempts but they all suck and none of them are effective in the least, with the exception of Nothing Sacred..definitely one-hit wonder status for these guys 
 Not that great which is why it is not selling 
 As a Russian Student at Moscow Lomonsov State University, my whole education is surrounded by Russia, Russians, and most of all history. I love it. But I don't love this book. I've had it for almost three years and still can't get around to finishing it all. It's a big, big book. One of the reason why I love history books so much is because they are a bargain! However that didn't turn me off, I actually was quite happy with the amount of information and the color excepts were fantastic. I can tell the author is enthusiasm for the cultural history because it goes from speaking about traveling musicians to how Peter the Great abhorred the unwesternized ways of Moscow. I mean, it goes from one thing to an completely different topic in only a paragraph on one page, and then picks up back with describing the local music of the small villages. The information is so rich and he wants to describe everything to us at once that the reader can get so overwhelmed and lost that it becomes boring to read. It isn't my first history book and I have so many unexciting textbooks I have to read, but I rather read my law book -- in Cyrillic -- then attempt to actually finish this book. You would think with around 700 pages he would be able to take his time. No doubt, this is for the serious reader and someone who is in need to cite something for their term paper (the index works very well indeed, that's one star) and the major information it gives you that you could hardly find in a text book (that's another star) but as reading you  
 The book is easy to read however, it is very hard to solve the problems. The author does not do a very good job showing which equation's are used. In the example problems the author bring's in values which are constant's  but does not indicate what the values are and the units. It is a very hard  text book to follow. However the derivation of the formulas are done very  well 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 It appears as if Ian has gone out of his way to make this book boring.The material in the book is superb but its presentation is rather poor 
 The characters and plot didn't compel me to get more than 1/4 of the way into the book.  While the tone of the novel is cyber-punkish or noir-ish, that alone wasn't enough to keep me going 
 This was Jule Styne's first "book" musical comedy for Broadway and it is mediocre in the extreme - with the notable exception of three numbers (Bye Bye Baby, A Little Girl From Little Rock and Diamonds Are A  Girl's Best Friend - the latter two  rendered by debuting comedienne Carol  Channing.)  These three numbers and Channing's now classic renditions of  the latter two are the ONLY reason for purchasing this album.   The songs  do not relate to the plot or characters and they are as forgettable as  Channing is not.  The original 14 78-rpm sides have been sonically  restored, but there's nothing to enjoy here except Carol 
 If you're reading this and you haven't read 'The Pelopponesian War" by Thucydides, stop it, drop it and go get that book. "A History of my Times," more appropriately and originally titled, "Hellenica," is the continuation and final conclusion to the "The Pelopponesian War", a history begun by Thucydides. You know a book is going to be bad, when in the introduction, the translator consistently says, "While not very good..." "Although seemingly flat...", "While his other works shine, this lacks..." If you have read "The Pelopponesian War," you are obligated to read this one, as Thucydides leaves the war unfinished midsentence. While I understand that some of Xenophon's works such as his war journals and such are excellent, swashbuckling reads. His "Hellenica" lacks the grace and inquisitive fire that Thucydides work, "The Pelopponesian War" did. It is a flat, dull read, only rewarding because it tightly ties the loose ends in "The Pelopponesian War." Also Xenophon is a staunch Spartan supporter and tends to ignore Athen's resurgence into power 
 I did not find this book particularly good. I did read the entire books, but that at almost 400 pages it was far too long and slow without any benefit from its length. The central characters were somewhat intriguing.   What ruined the book for me were too many inclusions of 20th century slang  terms. Words like "creep" and "the Mob." were used  freely, but back then they would not have been part of the everyday world  view. I also had the mystery solved in the first few pages. I think if the  book was 200 pages and the mystery was less obvious, it would have been  easier to overlook the inclusion of slang.  I think Lynda S. Robinson does  a better job of writing historical mysteries. Her characters are  interesting to the modern reader without being imports from the modern  world 
 One would like to believe that a group of MIT students truly did take Vegas for millions as Ben Mezrich claims. But in a era when diarists and autobiographers are routinely getting caught in lies, it's very difficult to believe this story. First, it reads like a bad pulp novel, filled with every possible B-movie cliche--security room beatings, casino owners waving guns in their faces on Aruban golf courses, swarthy Europeans threatening to kill them if they ever come back to Monte Carlo. Mix in a cast of characters straight out of central casting--the Russian math genius, the bombshell blond, the screwup with a drug problem, the obese nerd, and the charismatic mystery "leader" who hides hundreds of thousands of dollars in laundry baskets all over the greater Boston area. Then add sexual misunderstandings and B-movie "dialogue," and the author's own self-indulgent "visits" to Vegas brothels and casinos to "retrace" the kids' journey, and you get a far-fetched potboiler seemingly untethered to verifiable facts. Why, for example, did Mezrich not interview the kids' nemesis, a Vegas private eye who follows their movements and foils their plans everywhere they go? Why are there no interviews with security guards and casino managers who roughed them up in Vegas, Aruba, and Monte Carlo? How do we can believe that any of these people even existed, and that any of this is true, when Mezrich swallows their tale hook line and sinker? Read this entertaining but ultimally vacuous trifle for what it is--all bluff and fluff.  
 Where is the "Moderate Calvinist" view point?  Geisler's not a Calvinist in anyway but Arminian 
 I admire Nancy Campbell's attempts to counter the present-day view of children as burdens.  It is a tragedy that people sometimes view pregnancy as an evil, or that children are not treated as central in marriage.  I also admire her for pointing out the potentially abortificient nature of some common methods of birth control, including the Pill. This is information which should be available to all Christians.  However, the means she uses to argue against birth control are not always logical or scripturally sound. She takes individual Bible verses out of context at times. Overall, she has an unfortunate pattern of ignoring the cultural context of the Bible: she tries to map the cultural ways of ancient Hebrew culture onto the Church without seeming to realize that the Church, though it is the People of God, is not the SAME KIND of "people" that the nation of Israel was.  To give one prime example: the Hebrews were a hereditary group, and the nation increased primarily through new births. Christianity is not hereditary, however, at least not in so direct a way. Not only do not all children of believers grow up to be Christians, but Christians may come from other sources (evangelism, conversions). Thus, the Church is not dependant on procreation for its increase to the same degree that the nation of Israel was.  This is only one example: elsewhere she talks about economics and lineage as if these issues played out in the twenty-first century in the same way they did in Israel. They do not, of course: in the past, children were an economic gift to a family, not a burden, because they could earn money.  Would Campbell really argue that we should all put our children to work at an early age so that we reap the same economic benefits?  There are other problems with the books' use of Biblical texts, as well. Some texts get repeated multiple times to bear out different points, thus creating a repetitive effect that becomes annoying. Other texts are dropped into the page without any explanation of how they prove the point they are supposed to prove. Sometimes this is due to only a lack of adequate exposition; other times it may be due to her trying to put too much "weight" on a single verse.   Finally, I have to agree with previous posters that Campbell does not really prove that contraception is immoral. All she manages to prove is that children are supposed to be viewed as one of the primary fruits of marriage.  As I said before, this is a worthy goal and I applaud her for it, but given the kinds of arguments she makes, it might have been better if she had stayed with that point 
 I feel that the writing style is a little confusing even though Jensen is a master. I also recommend to integrate the three volumes to one due to the simplicity and vol. 2 just took 182 pages. In addition, the notations  relatively differ from the ones in Peterson's Petri nets 
 This book is most appropriate for someone who has just entered the workforce.  Many of the lessons regarding behavior in the professional world are useful, but not profound.  I was  dissapointed in the section of the book devoted to personal matters.  In general, I would not recommend to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of basic personal financial skills.  
 The unique screen chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of "The African Queen." Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to "True Grit" wouldn't pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project -- he might have improved upon Martha Hyer's routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a blaze of glory with "The Shootist" (1976) 
 Any James Patterson fan has to be completely willing to suspend disbelief:  there are more holes in his story than in one of the knife wound or bullet-riddled corpses killed by the villain, Geoffrey Shafer.    Shafer is a cartoon character walking away from every situation perfectly intact.  Just a few of the issues: How come there was no evidence in his hideaway?  There would have been tons. Stripping the victims to remove their ID.  How ludicrous.  Anybody, including Shafer would know about prints, dental records.  Nina Childs was young and strong. She would have fought back and scratched, bitten and hit him and not just let him beat her to death.  How could Shafer have known about Cross' plans to go to Bermuda? Completely uncredible.  How could he have followed them to Bermuda without anybody finding out?.  FBI could easily have determined who purchased a plane ticket to Bermuda through the British Embassy on the date he went. How come his family couldn't tell he was a drug crazed loonie with all the drugs he popped?  Didn't they ever look at his eyes? How come the family never saw any blood on him? How come nobody was around to see him dump Mr. Odenkirk in the gutter and strip him in a busy neighborhood.  Maybe he did it in the taxi.  Do you know how hard it is to move a 200 lb corpse?  There would have been an ocean of blood and brains in the taxi, impossible to clean up -- not just "dark stains on the upholstery that looked like blood". And a bullet hole in the back window.  How could the cops not have spotted this? What about all of his bloody clothes and shoes?  Why didn't they search his house?  Patsy Hampton would have been too smart to tail a lunatic serial killer by herself.  Her ending up alone with him in the parking garage is completely uncredible.  Shafer's trial is also ridiculous.  They would have considered the blood of multiple victims and other evidence they found in his taxi, house etc. How could the psychiatrist not have noticed the blood on Shafer right away after he killed Patsy?  Doesn't play. And she was a cardboard bimbo too. Why would his wife support him at the trial and then just run away?  His wife was a wooden character with no personality anyway. Why wouldn't Cross have revealed, and testified about, the threatening phone calls from Shafer and the fantasy game playing, at the trial? Who would have kept Christine safe and in secret for a year?  Boy, does that one strain credibility. Oh, and the end game came out of nowhere.  A lame foundation for why Shafer would want to off his partners all of a sudden, after playing The Four Horsemen with them for eight years. The book has as many killings as there are sex scenes in Fanny Hill.  The story would have been MUCH better if some of them had been foiled. I expected someone to foil his killing in Virginia when the dice told him it was the wrong time to kill. The end of the book was sickening, and a cop-out.  Right.  Just a teaser for the next Geoffrey Shafer meets Alex Cross rag.  My guess is Patterson knew all this, but he didn't care because he was too eager to take his royalty checks to the bank.  Now, here is a skilled writer at the top of his craft.  What he knows is just how hard he has to work to get the book to the publisher.  	 This was not a one-star book because the plot and the quality writing definitely kept me interested.  But it scarcely rises above a two.  Next time, please write smarter, not faster 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 "It must now be self-evident that there is a vast gulf between the Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith."  This is Baigent's theme in "The Jesus Papers."  But does he succeed?  Does he provide evidence to prove his assertion, or even lead a careful reader to consider his claim probable?  No.  Not even close.  Mr. Baigent's method is flawed.  For example, he frequently calls into question the reliability of early historical documents, while relying heavily on anecdotal material, which is often relatively late from a historical perspective.  At times this "evidence" exists simply as the word of one person living in the 20th century.  Another problem is that Baigent is guilty of special pleading.  He discredits the New Testament Gospel accounts which are contrary to his beliefs as unreliable, but then quotes from the gospels when they help establish his point.  Often it is apparent that Mr. Baigent has left behind the realm of historical facts and entered the realm of speculation because he pauses in his narrative to ask questions such as "Could it be...?", "Is it perhaps possible that...?", etc.  But, once he has asked the questions, his answers to his own speculations are considered proven true, and he addresses them accordingly through the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, I don't have the space here to document his countless speculations, errors, and distortions.  Here are just a few.  Perhaps the single most outrageous claim in the book is the assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion.  However, Jesus' death by crucifixion is so widely accepted that virtually no skeptic continues to entertain this possibility.  The event of his death is affirmed by Christian and non-Christian sources, as well as by the general expertise the Romans possessed in this manner of execution.  Baigent comments that Jesus, if he died on the cross, would have died more quickly than expected.  He neglects, however, to mention that Jesus first endured being severely beaten with a three-lash whip with pieces of bone or metal on the ends.  This whip tore the flesh of the skeletal muscles and set the stage for circulatory shock.  Following the scourging that Jesus received, he was probably in serious to critical condition prior to his crucifixion.  During the crucifixion, he sustained five additional serious wounds, including the wounds caused by the nails and the spear in His side, which almost certainly pierced one lung and the heart.  According to a 1986 article entitled "On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ" which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association, "Clearly, the weight of the historical and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead before the wound to His side was inflicted and supports the traditional view that the spear, thrust between His right ribs, probably perforated not only the right lung but also the pericardium and heart and thereby ensured his death.  Accordingly, interpretations based on the assumption that Jesus did not die on the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge."  In addition to the medical evidence, the death (and resurrection) of Jesus is evidenced by the behavior and experiences of the disciples.  It is nearly unanimously accepted among historical scholars (including such skeptics as "Jesus Seminar" members Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan) that Jesus' disciples, following his crucifixion, were initially discouraged and despondent but shortly afterward had multiple experiences that they believed were actual appearances of the risen Jesus.  Additionally, due to these experiences, the disciples' lives were completely transformed, to the extent that they were willing to die for their belief that they had seen the resurrected Jesus.  It is utterly nonsensical to suggest that this level of belief and commitment could have been inspired by their experience of a badly wounded, bloodied, extremely sick Jesus barely clinging to life.  This scenario could explain their belief that they had seen him alive, but not their claim to have seen him resurrected.  Rather than relying on early historical documents to support his claim, Mr. Baigent's assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion is based largely on the suggestion of one 20th century man, who claimed to have learned it directly from another man, who is supposed to have seen an elusive document making this claim.  This story will only convince the gullible.  By comparison, a surprising number of ancient historical texts (which are not elusive) record the death of Jesus, including a number of highly respected, primitive creeds that predate the New Testament, the Gospel narratives themselves, at least ten non-Christian texts, and several noncanonical early Christian sources.  In contrast to the evidence presented by Baigent, these sources provide multiple early evidences for the event of the death of Jesus by crucifixion.    Similar arguments can be made to refute other assertions made by Mr. Baigent, including Jesus' denial that he was the son of God, the relative reliability of the Gnostic Gospels, the supposedly lost years of Jesus in Egypt, the claim that Christianity was essentially the creation of Paul, and many others.    In chapter 13, Mr. Baigent laments what he refers to as the lack of "pure historians" in the field of biblical scholarship.  It seems we are justified in assuming that he would categorize himself in this manner, yet his haphazard acceptance and rejection of various data disqualifies him as a scholar.  Hardly objective, his sole test for evidence is whether it supports to his own view. 
 Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that.  And this was the Michael Glenny translation 
 Why were the streets in this book given names each combining two states? Florizona, for instance. Was that supposed to be funny? It was simply annoying, as was this entire book. The characters, with perhaps the exception of Boyd, were bloodless, lifeless. I had no sense that they existed beyong the moments when they appeared in the story. I couldn't wait to finish the book, not because there was any mystery to it, but because I wanted to be finished with it. I never warmed up to Ben or anyone else. 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
 Many love the Quincunx, and more power to them; I only hope to help the book find the right reader. I was obviously the wrong one.  The book is indeed a reprise of Dickens, good and bad.   The bad: I found it verbose in the extreme. Palliser would never write one word when a hundred would do instead. This habit becomes especially irritating as he dwells on the squalor to which he dooms his main characters. He seems to enjoy torturing them at extravagent length; the book makes "Angela's Ashes" feel like "Annie" by comparison. As you flip forward looking for relief, you will find none.  Its plot is transparent and convoluted at the same time. You will quickly solve the basic mystery in the first hundred pages, but it will take you hours of note-taking to pin down the actual details, if you ever do. And like many nineteeth-century novels, the plot is often driven forward by the naive stupidity of its characters. Watching the John's mother foolishly walk into one legal or financial landmine after another, you may wish you could enter into the book to strangle the poor, brainless woman, putting a quicker end to her misery, and yours.  If you enjoy all the cliches of nineteenth-century British literature--futile court cases stretching over generations, the injustice of the law, extremes of social inequality, the hypocrisy and selfishness of the landed classes--then this book is for you. It sure wasn't for me 
 First of all, the track listing is wrong from what appears on the Amazon site as of 6-14-2006. It's not even close.  Second, there are no demos on this. Am I missing something?? I preordered this to get the demos and all we have are live recordings. The sound on this is awful, very similar to the Stooges live recordings. If your familar with those, you know what I mean. I would have given it one star, but it is still a interesting listen, as I love The New York Dolls. I'm shocked they would release this the way it sounds. It appears to be a attempt to make money without putting a dime in cleaning up the sound on this. The Vancouver show is the only decent recording on this release 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 The original Five Love Languages was insightful, had a variety of examples and provided a good amount of psychological and Christian theory and application.  This book is supposed to be for singles, but almost every example has to do with dating couples--people I don't really consider single.  Rarely does it talk about regular friendship--and when it does, it's guy-girl friendships.  I was hoping to get some insight into my same-sex friendships, family relationships and guy-girl non-romantic friendships, but this book falls horribly short of that.  Get the original copy and just use a little imagination and brain-power to apply it to your single life.  You'll save the time, money and frustration 
 While I can not speak for the book, I challenge another reviewers comments about the Author's restaraunt in Denver.  Do not eat there.  The service was beyond poor, it was lousy.  The staff was rude.  Plan on waiting over an hour to get in (assuming they do not cross out your name like they did ours).  You will have to wait another 30 minutes, once seated, to get drinks or place a food order.  It will take another hour to get the food.  Hopefully, the Author does not encourage this type of behavior in his book. On a positive note, the food was good 
 This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as "The Cat In The Hat" and "The Grinch".  My daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation.  We give this video a thumbs down 
  I read this book for a project two years ago. I wasn't about to finish this book and had to move to another one. First off, this book lacks emotion. This character is so boring. She doesn't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me, a book without emotion is just unreadable. I hated this book, but I don't like most Scott O'Dell books. Just go read another book 
 I bought this safe less than six months ago, and here I am, searching for another safe box again.  At first, the key was stuck, and after many, many tries, I manage to loosen up the key and use it.  Now, I am using just security codes.  And whenever I enter the codes, it does not open or close on first, second attempts.  It opens after I keep trying.  Pretty much, it's not reliable.  It can not handle daily use, and over time wear and tear.  I have changed the batery twice.  And I only had it for less than six months 
 The only good pixies song is where is my mind. I heard this on the fight club movie. I thought it was a great song so i listened to this cd. It sucked. DOn't listen to i 
 If you haven't read anything on e-commerce at all, or if you're a total newbie, the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business. For someone who is already in the business or has already done some research, this book merely repeats a lot of well-known tips. Even then, some of the tips, like in section on affiliate programs, are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic.  As for the first part of the book where Allen demonstrates how he could earn $24k in one day, I find it totally unrealistic and it certainly won't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has Robert Allen's background to begin with. Even then, this sort of strategy won't cut it with today's wise and cynical netizens anymore. 
 This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible.  And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth.  I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them.  I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up!  What a waste of money.  Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned.  This product is a joke 
 Sorry, but I've seen much better dog movies.  My son begged for this movie, based on the cute dogs on the cover.  I don't remember anyone laughing at the pitful jokes, even the kids didn't laugh.  The kids enjoyed the movie, but I wish we had only paid a $3 rental fee 
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital. I was very disappointed with this book 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 I feel this book hurts the message that using alternatives to traditional medicine should be explored. This is one of many examples throughtout the book. On page 22 "In real numbers, this means that for every 1,000 women using one of these drugs, 300 will eventually develop breast cancer from the HRT itself." This sounds very scary but is flat out wrong. A 30% increase in risk is not a 30% risk as this book implies. In real numbers this means that instead of 100 women out of 1000 developing breast cancer 130 women out of 1000 would develop breast cancer on HRT. Not to mention that a lot of studies do not show such a high increase in risk. How can anyone trust the assertions of this book if in the first 22 pages there are such blatant untruths 
 Do not buy this CD, it's terrible.  One of the biggest mistakes I ever made is buying this CD...it is now a coaster 
 I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time.  It was just that bad.  I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it.  It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel.  It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry.  I almost feel dumber for having read this.  Is this really what women RELATE to?  If so, that is so sad?  I found every character in this book just sad.  Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love.  C'mon!  Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown.  F 
 Take basic baby Wicca. Add dragon images. Stir it all together like paint or a bad mocha. End of book.  Dungeons & Dragons literally has a better draconic cosmology. Any skilled practitioner of an established occult system could cast better spells with a D&D book and their pre-existing discipline.  Avoid this book, unless you simply wish to add to your established collection of "all books that include dragons". The second star is because it does have some cute pictures, and details that could be added to a fantasy roleplaying game 
 I wanted to read the book before watching the film. I have heard how inspirational the film is. The book should be, but is too full of excuses and bragging. When Chris Gardner eventually started to make a sucessful career for himself, he sent his son away to live with the mother who abandoned him. Not very inspirational. I would not recommend this book 
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 The price of this collection was originally $36.86 dollars, why did you increase the cost by $10 dollars 
 Some of the advice in this book is great, especially on suggestions for enjoying meals socially without feeling like a freak. However, based on the title and the author's condition, it's easy to assume that the only foods recommended in the book are gluten-free, and that's not true. Several of the recipes and purchased-food recommendations are wheat-free, but not gluten-free, and are NOT clearly identified as such. I found the tone to be rather snobbishly superior, as well- perhaps a nice book for those in the caviar-eating set, but not written for the unprivileged who can not expect to be waited on hand and foot or to be able to afford all the specialty foods the author considers necessities 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today.  I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews.  When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it!  LOL I'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it. : 
 This is one of those books where all the best parts can be found on the book jacket!  I was intrigued by the book jacket description of the Swap Shop Show:  "If you've got something you're itching to sell, something  you mighta never woulda bought no way, then give us a call," but this  idea isn't expanded upon in the text.  Instead, this seems to be another in  a series of recent books where the authors seem to believe a series of  quirky characters alone a great novel make.  Not so.  Readers want  characters they can get to know, characters who grow and change throughout  the book, not a series of semi-related vignettes about cardboard cutouts of  people.  I particularly found McCorkle unable to handle the parallel story  lines well.  Perhaps the plot ties together in the end (I just couldn't get  that far, I really tried!), but the impression I got was of jerking back  and forth between stories that may have stood better on their own.  For  examples of successful books employing the parallel-lives technique, see  Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full* or Michelle Huneven's *Round Rock.*  I've  gathered in reading reviews that McCorkle is being hailed as a great new  Southern author; I found no Southern flavor at all in this book.  These  silly characters could have lived anywhere.  I guess I'll stick to Rita Mae  Brown when I want a taste of the South 
 My feelings are very mixed on the live performance by 2Pac. But in the end, I feel it is a CD that should be avoided unless you absolutely need everything issued under 2Pac's name.   The sound quality is terrible; it would not rate well if being issued as a bootleg. The CD starts off with a Live Medley, but drops in about the middle of California Love. Even the most idiotic bootlegger would not make such a mistake.  If you decide to continue listening, it is probably because there is a dearth of live material by 2Pac that has found its way to CD. But because of that, why would something of such poor quality be the best for a commercial release?   And at the end of the 40 or so minutes, it becomes obvious...Suge Knight was trying one more time to cash in on 2Pac's legacy before his label became totally insignificant.  The CD does not have the Amaru logo on it, meaning that Afeni Shakur did not approve the release. But Knight's name is written in bold letters anywhere it can fit.  After taking it all in, Knight should have done 2Pac's fans a favor and just made an appeal for donations on the Internet.   
 THERE WAS NO DOUBT I WASN'T WARNED BEFORE PURCHASING THIS, WHAT I WAS GETTING.  IT'S SARCASTIC, PARTS ARE FUNNY, BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME BY FINISHING THE BOOK. HOWEVER, HIS BOOK ABOUT THE WOLF & 3 PIGS WAS MUCH MORE CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 Completely fails to discuss the most fantastic and least logical idea promulgated withing the last 200 years, that life in all of its variation evolved from a series of random accidents.  As for criticism of the aquatic ape theory, it's far more logical than other "mainstream" theories and most scientists have ran from this theory without even attmepting to evaluate it. After all, it was written by a woman in a man's profession so why should it be taken seriously 
 I cant imagine any one accepting this unbelievable story line. It's garbage, probably one of if not the worst I've ever read. I made it through 30-40 pages before it ended up in the trash.  So much for this author, he may have had a winner or two but from this point on he's on my "do not buy list"  I gave it a one star because there was nothing lower 
 I have read Ralph Kimball's Tool Kit as well as Nicholas Galemmo's Mastering Data Warehouse Design books recently - both are excellent for techno-functional professionals. This book reminds me of a textbook they made you read to have an overview of EDP about 30 years ago.. 
 I found "The Forever War" a forever let-down. Considering all the hype and the Hugo and Nebula awards, I would have expected much better.  The main complaint is the irrelevant ending.  We get to know and care about characters, and follow their thorny path along the plot, wonder where they go, and who they will become at the end of the story, and then !BLAM-O!  We get an ending--a sappy, car crash, too pat ending--that had nothing to do with the previous 34 chapters. In business, we would call this fraud; in law, breach of contract.  This slipshod ending is either do to Haldeman's artistic ability, or it is a reflection of his worldview.  It cannot be the first--Haldeman has that rare flair to mix science with narrative, which makes for top notch sci-fi.  (His use of time dilation is a masterstroke) Therefore I think it comes from his worldview, which, like most people of his generation, was hastily generalized by the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's.   To paraphrase Jack London, I got the feeling that his generalizations (like many of his generation) were made between the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon, and he had failed to revise them since then.  So is this a critique of Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers" or a critique of Nam?  I go back and forth with this novel.  It does serve to temper Heinlein's idealism--the "if men were angels" problem--but it also serves to normalize (or at least desensitize) madcap behavior.  In this way, the book is a less funny "Catch-22" or a cosmic "Caine Mutiny."  Of course Heinlein, as a non-combat servicemen, knew how sailors talked and drank and did AHEM, but his book is clearly didactic, while Haldeman's is merely descriptive.  Even so, I felt manipulated.  All the career servicemen were jingoistic warmongers; all the conscripted NCOs were morally pure victims.  And calling some of the aliens "teddy bears" was cheap saccharine.  Additionally, there is the prepubescent glee in transforming Heinlein's juvie into an adult novel--complete with adult situations, adult language, and rampant adultery.  The chapters (especially the earlier ones) were formulaic:  1.	They are given new orders that do not make any sense. 2.	Something goes wrong with the irrational orders. 3.	S.N.A.F.U. 4.	Mandella and a female NCO have AHEM.  The characters had no motivation, just passive shoulder shrugging. In this sense they are not protagonists, just placeholders who use sex as escape.  In turn, the genetically altered post-humans become homosexual, so even that one release is removed.  Unlike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or Galahad, once Mandella becomes chaste, he never became interesting.  "My strength is as the strength of ten/Because my heart is pure."  Even so, Haldeman doe illustrate some important flaws with conscription, casual drug use, casual sex, government solipotence, government deception.  (Keeping in mind that all of these go hand-in-hand). Furthermore, the book may have been helpful in the post-Vietnam era, as a release and a reaffirmation of what just happened.  If it is, then the book looses it's relevancy in the current conflagration. There is no miscommunication and no misunderstanding the terrorists. 
 Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details 
 As a biologist by education and interest I had such high hopes. I must disclose, however, that I only made it halfway thru this fairy tale, as I had little hope of not throwing more good time after bad. Nonsense! 
 It's not just that this book is written horribly (it's nothing but extreme excerpts from people who've obviously made therapy their personal hobby).  It's not just that this book fails to offer actual constructive ideas about dealing with trust issues (although it does explain, ad nauseum, all the ways you might see trust issues).  The real problem is that it sounds like the most old-school, formulaic psycho-babble you could possible imagine.  In a nutshell, here's what this book will tell you:  1.  it's all because of your parents and 2.  it's all because of your gender.  Helpful?  NO!  I really have no idea where all the good reviews on this book are coming from.  Seriously, if I didn't have such extreme trust issues, I'd wonder if the author didn't pay a couple of his friends to drop Amazon a note.. 
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 This is a dual disc with a nearly standard resoultion mix (16bit@48KHz) deliberately published by SOny (the creator with Philips of the SACD!) to infringe the Dual Disc reputation. Dual Disc itself is not good or bad: can have up to 24bit@192KHz in stereo mode and 24bit@96KHz in multichannel mode. The system is garbage in-garbage out: if you put garbage in (16 bit resolution) you get garbage out (16 bit resolution. If you wish to enjoy Dual Disc / DVD-A go elsewhere: PCM is superior to DSD (you'll hardly listen the difference if the recording is well done, though. The Miles Davis is outstanding, of cours 
 I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.    One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".    I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.  This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.   
 I never liked this version of this album. It has too many extra songs that just didn't sound right to me.  I love the original version of C.H.H. The one with the black and white cover and it has the men in the far background walking.  I have that one in cassette and i'm waiting for the CD to come in the mail.  
 I saw this movie 'cause I love horror, and I love Halle. But this movie just sucked 
 For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.  This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.   Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.   Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).   I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.  The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.   Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.   Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?) 
 The shortcomings of Doniger's general Indological scholarship have been detailed by Michael Witzel and Rajiv Malhotra. This book suffers from the same flaws. The translations are idiosyncratic, and she is obsessed with finding sex, even in situations that none is called for 
 Nail Art is a great idea and the book has many cute and creative nail projects. However, we have found that it is very hard to duplicate the designs in the book. My daughter, age 10, can't do it herself. I also have a hard time. Then, when you finally get something you like, the polish peels right off. Peel-off polish is a fantastic concept, but it would be better if it at least lasted  a few hours. We love the concept, but I rated it a 2 because it really isn't usable. It's also expensive, so I feel it is a waste of your money. 
 The format of this book makes it real hard to read and detracts greatly from the content. Your eyes have to dart from one side of a page to the other and back again then to the middle.  The content is important but on the edge of the spectrum which makes it even more difficult to read at times with the far fetched concepts. I'm not a big fan of this one 
 I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 The item is not my concern; I still have not even received it 
 I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.  Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.  The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me. 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 The quality of the recording on the Audio Series is very poor. It distracted from the message. I was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book, but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons. Tape 2 of 3 was a recording of someone besides Tommy Tenney 
 I expected this book to be more than a workbook to supplement another textbook.  I was looking for something which actually provided content on Building, Measuring and Managing Brand Equity.  Maybe I misread the description of this book.  I was actually looking for the text of the main book in paperback format 
 Ordered this because it was suggested by Amazon as a book that might be of interest. This because I am so very fond of David Petersen's writing. Kerasote can't hold a candle to Petersen! He does not enlarge his subject to include any of the larger insights or issues, of which there are many imbedded in the subject of man and nature. From Melville to Petersen, we have struggled to describe and comprehend our relationship to society and nature. Kerasote adds little to the discussion 
 It is a fact that the human race originated in Africa. It is also a fact that civilization originated in the Middle East. So what 
 Okay, this is positively one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This movie is nothing but plotless nudity, violence, etc. etc. etc.  Okay okay, maybe that's your thing.  If so, then I suppose you'll love this movie.  But after I got about half way through it, it dawned on me that nothing was going to happen but more of the same.  I figured the good guys would end up winning out in the end and maybe the ending would be okay, but by the time I stopped the movie, I just didn't care and wanted to watch something else.  Bottom line, if you love plotless movies, violence and nudity, go for it.  But if you like a story with a plotline, stay away 
 Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.  Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.   
 I thought "I am Legend" was a real snooze - pretty boring actually. I also thought it wasn't very well thought out. Matheson poses some questions throughout the story but never answers them. So you never really know how the plague starts or why. You never fully understand how it spread and how the main character ends up where he is. Then you never understand why the woman het meets is the way she is. Then the ending is sort of like "oh well, it's about time to wrap this up - I know, let's just kill off the main character, that'll do." I was very disappointed. I tried the next story and found it to be even more disappointing and so I stopped reading the book 
 I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).  This refers to the CD version.  I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.      I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?)   It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "integrity" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much.   
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 While the book has some great ideas and questions our assumptions about how we interact with babies, some ideas of this approach seem odd.  Such as seeing the act of burping your baby as hitting?  Or that rocking your baby is inappropriate?  I very much agree with another reviewer who said this book is written in a "know-it-all" tone, too.  I only tolerate that tone when there is research to back it up.     
 A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.  
 New Rule:  Stop confusing cruelty with honesty.  -Bill Maher thinks it's his job to tell people the "ugly" truth. But truth that doesn't help make things better is really cruelty gift-wrapped.  Telling people their religions are bogus is not helpful. He says we don't need a savior or a religion or a God, but everyday people are on their hands and knees begging for one. I guess if I had been born a white man in America and never faced any hardships or heartaches, I wouldn't need God either. Furthermore, everybody has religion. It's just that all of our religions aren't in churches. Some people's religions are drugs or sex or pain or alcohol or anything else that we use to help fill that void in our hearts. What's YOUR religion?  It's also funny how Bill Maher ISN'T a Democrat, yet most of his fans are. Hmmm, ever heard the saying, you are what you attract? Libertarianism is only liberalism by a different name. Compare the two and find they agree 95% of the time.  The bottom line is Bill Maher is an arrogant man who thinks he's right about everything and that the majority of America is stupid. Well if America is so stupid, why should we have a democratic system where the stupid have influence? Why not have an oligarchy where only Cornell graduates make the decisions? Better yet, why don't we have a dictatorship with Maher as our leader considering he's the only one with any real intelligence.  He's an immoral man who thinks he's moral because he confuses it with ethics. Ethics is how fairly you treat people. Morality is Godly obedience. Morality says it's wrong to be a pros-ti-tute because our bodies are sacred. Ethics says it's wrong for a pros-ti-tute to t-i-e her John to the b-e-d then steal his wallet. 
 Although Vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher, it is not enough to research well; one must also be a writer, and Vestal's embarrassing attempts to mimic Bridger's speech is a travesty.  From inane, trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction, it is clear that Vestal needed a much stronger editor.  Recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research 
 Dont buy this DVD!  Surrender Cinema has a unfortunate knack of claiming "Director's Cut" on it's DVDs when in fact they are no such thing. This film is rather heavily censored.  All the other reviews of this are apparently from pople who  don't realize this sad fact.  Sorry you wasted your money because many scenes/takes have been cut out of the US version, despite the fact it claims "Directors Cut".  Be weary... you're being had my friends. Sad thing is, I rate the "real" director's cut version 5 stars all the way 
 No joke, I've heard multiple tapes of events he's spoken at (as well as attended one) and he openly states this movie bites.  Those rating 3, 4 or lm*o 5 stars are "Fan Boys".  Don't get me wrong, I like S.King's stuff (It, Misery, Pet Sematary for example) but this one is to be avoided 
 The book is supposed to be great...so long as you can find accessories to it.  And that is a hassle--no books for kindergardeners to find anywhere [...] What was the point of spending [...] to purchase the station if there are no books to use it with?  
 Even before I read The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience, my experience in the church had made me suspect that Evangelical Christians weren't particularly moral people. And the first chapter of Sider's book, "The Depth of the Scandal", goes a long way toward confirming my suspicions. Sider quotes statistics that paint a damning picture of Evangelicals, including their high rate of divorce, their appalling tendency toward abuse, and their disappointing attachment to money.  But even though I'm skeptical about the morality of Western Christians, I still have hope. Despite the Church's history of disappointing behavior, I still think Jesus had it right, and I still believe God has the power to turn sinners into saints. So after reading the first sad chapter, I hoped that Sider would share some bright examples, some lighthouses of Christian community and Christian morality.  I was disappointed.  Sider spends the rest of the book spinning his wheels, treating us to a dull 100 pages in which he insists that right doctrine, church discipline and small groups will turn the church around.  Now when it comes to contrasting the wealth of Christians with the poverty of the world at large, Sider is a refreshing respite from the ambivalence of most Evangelical preachers. In a particularly barbed passage, Sider writes, "Not one evangelical pastor in ten comes even close to talking as much about the poor as the Bible does."  But these bright spots are overshadowed by Sider's preoccupation with ineffective solutions and his odd pet issues, which pop up up so predictably that one begins to suspect that odd pet issues are a prerequisite to being an evangelical. Legislation is suggested as a way to create a more Christian nation. A biblical worldview is equated with traditional evangelical doctrine. The enlightenment, post-modernism, evolutionary theory and the occult are all fingered as hastening the downfall of Christian morality. And in one of the book's saddest passages, the racism that Sider decries is practically assumed:  Our people, especially congregational leaders, need to see poverty firsthand. Mission trips, either across town to spend a weekend with an African American or Latino congregation or to another country in Africa or Latin America, can be powerful change agents. (italics mine) Sider would have ended up with a much better book if he had spent more time trying to understand the problem, and less time trying to mold his pet issues into a generic, whole-church solution. Instead, he spends the last three-quarters of the book chipping away at his own credibility, and by the book's end, the interesting and useful ideas in his first chapter have disappeared into a mess of orthodoxy and unlikely solutions 
 I have been reading Instyle magazine for a few years now.  The first thing I always turn to in each issue is the Party Guide.  As far back as 2002 I started tearing out the Party Guides, putting them in plastic sheet protectors and filing them in a binder to make my own cookbook.  I flipped thru this book in the bookstore and it was exactly what I expected - Party Guides from 2003(Apr, Dec), 2004(Jan, Apr, Sept, Oct) and 2005(Apr, May, July, Sept) reprinted in a book.  There were a couple that I didn't recognize, but I have different versions of the theme from other years.  What I really wish Instyle would do is release another Special Issue on Entertaining like the one they did for the 2000 Holiday season.  I refer to that one alot 
 I had the entire story figured out by about page 10 and I'm not usually very good at guessing plots. This was extremely predictable. The characters were okay, but not great. The little girl, Bernadette, is by far the best character in the book.  Not really worth the time or money to read 
 i'm sorry, but i couldn't even finish this book. i bought it used only because i thought oh, virginia is so famous! she must be wonderful! but was astonished at the lack of human thought that showed up, the lack of sense. i really had no idea of what was happening, even though i made it to pg. 100. jacob just runs on and on about sophocles, about greek philosophy--oh he's so deep. deep enough to make you regret getting this book 
 Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who "invented" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has. The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.   
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 If you like reading about a rat, and Anthony Tate stroking his ego for 400 pages of text, you mite like this book 
 Reviewer Santteresa was totally correct. This is another incoherent nightmare from a bad revisionist author with a good publicist. The author does his usual rewriting of history. He often ignores the sources we have, and reinterprets them along his own inane version of political correctness. On one page he makes the most bigoted and incorrect statement one could imagine. "He said that the blood of the Gauls who sacked Rome in 390bc proudly ran in his veins. First, that proves his dismissive attitude towards the builders of western civilization. Second, the Irish have NOTHING whatever in common with the "Italian Celts-Gauls who started the wars with the Roman Republic!" As for his New Age version of Christianity. "How could the author, or anyone else for that matter put themselves in the minds or hearts of the apostles Peter or Paul? PLEASE, don't waste your time or money 
 This is a horrible product.  The pieces won't stay together. It would be very difficult for a child to put this together without constant adult supervision. The product has VERY poor engineering and quality control. 
 I found this book too much focused on "Mission statements" "values" and "vision", which I would expect is your entrepreneural common sense. It includes very little about actually preparing statements or plans. There is only one sample plan at the end for a winery. I didn't find any information on approaching investors.  I returned this book and bought Nolo's book instead 
 I was VERY unhappy with my book purchase. When I recieved it the first thing I noticed was a VERY unpleasant odor coming from the book. I thought it would go away but it did not. It was one of the most disgusting and vulgar smells I have ever smelt. I could not even read the book without getting nausious. I asked for a replacement and they said there was nothing they could do and that is was probaly just the ink. I tried everything to get the smell out but ended up throwing it away and buying another one. Very dissatisfied customer 
 I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.  Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem 
 This was my first time reading a book by Hansen, and frankly I was not impressed. The book is about a Colorado rancher who leaves for Mexico after the suicide of his son. There are so many different characters to keep track of, it is hard to keep it straight. There is also much information that just does not need to be there, for example references to the book "To Kill a Mockingbird". The worst of it all just about half way through the whole story is retold from a different viewpoint, I was not exactly ecstatic about the change. On the other hand, there were a few instances of great descriptions, that is what gave this book the two stars. Overall you would not have wasted your couple of dollars or $0.74 if purchased used 
 As I am not referenced in the book, do not have the same surname as the author and did not contribute to the work, I am less impressed with 'Crossroads' than the other reviewers.  In complete agreement with the sentiment that there is little quality information on Hecate, I purchased this book before it was reviewed, but would not recommend anyone else to do the same.   It gave a muddled account of the known history of this dark goddess, confusing speculation with fact and giving no information I had not discovered elsewhere. Confusing witchcraft with wicca and christian concepts, the ceremonial focus of the rituals dedicated to Hecate AND Hermes and the contradictions inherent in the work left me disappointed.  The second chapter on how certain individuals had discovered Hecate was interesting but not enough to justify the cost of the book.  Grammatical errors, sweeping generalisations and narrow referencing did little to improve my opinion. I found the book to be well-intentioned, but at times slightly confused.  There are some great websites out there giving you the same information and additional background (e.g. Hecate's Cauldron) for those with an interest in witchcraft rather than wicca. Unfortunately, instead of expanding my knowledge on the subject, this book left me with nothing but a feeling I had wasted my money 
 This item was purchased as a gift and I was very unhappy when I received the item. The box it came in was very bent up and the top of the box would not even close properly. The flashlight was missing the cord to hang it from and it was hard to get to work after following the directions. I would not buy this product again 
 see through.  I don't wear it because it is so thin it is see thru.  maybe a darker color would of been better but this powder blue sucked 
 I fell in love with the "Anne of Green Gables" movies when I was a little girl because of they were such lovely interpretations of the L.M. Montgomery books. Meagan Follows IS Anne Shirley. When I found out that a third installment of the series was coming out, I could not wait. However, what I received left a very bad taste in my mouth. "Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story" was horrible! The story was terrible and did not live up to the previous installments that drew you in to the story. With this film, I really didn't care about the characters the way I had in the past. The only thing I did care about was the fact that Anne and Gil were FINALLY together, but was still disappointed by their rushed wedding - something I had been waiting for for a very long time. I don't think that we, as fans, had the opportunity to really enjoy their wedding the way we had always imagined we would. I also hated the fact that the character of Jack and his son, in a way, came between Anne and Gil. Sometimes I felt like Anne was cheating on Gil with her interactions with Jack. I wanted to see Anne and Gil have their own children and raise them in the wonderfully heartwarming way they were raised, not with all of the melodrama of WWI.  I truly wish that a better ending to an extraodinary series could have been made, but I guess I'll make do with the first two movies. I can't say enough great things about those films!   The only reason I am giving this film one star - I would like to give it zero - is because some of the original cast is back. It was great to see Anne, Gil, and Dianna once again!  If you are a fan of "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea" (aka "Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel"), don't bother purchasing this last installment. Although I'm sure you will want to see what happened to all of your favorite characters, your hopes will certainly be dashed and disappointed by a poor story and poor dialogue 
 I have been a fan of Patti Austin for years now but what (...) is this? It stinks big time. It's nothing but forgettable elevator R&B Jazz that I really dislike. Another shock is the use of poor language in Playing Around. How could such an amazing diva sink to such a (...)state? I,m not necessarily turning my back in her this time but I am very dissapointed with this album. Hey, at least I have a coaster to use now. This one's worth passing up. Better luck next time Patti and make it more memorable please 
 I read Shogun before and it's binding is falling apart as it was an hand me down. I really expected more... I somewhat expected the characters to be engaging and somewhat realistic. I was left unconvinced by his characterizations of British, American and even Japanese. I actually found the Japanese characters more believable than the "Gai-Jins". The novel is in my mind a failure and the history of the era seem also faulty in it's interpretation. I think that even the names of the Japanese characters are totally false in historical terms from what I can find in history books 
 This book does have some nice pictures, but I don't like the way some of the animals are named, for example calf instead of cow, kitten instead of cat....  I think very young children find it easier to say  cat, cow instead of kitten and calf.  There were too many of these types of identifiying names.  I'd stick with a book that has the basic names and work from there as my child gets older 
 In a quest to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I followed this recipe with enthusiasm and excitement.  When I served them, the expression on everybody's face was more than I needed to know, they were absolutely the most disgusting chocolate chip cookies I had ever tasted!  Not only did the batches of cookies go in the garbage, so did the book.  
 This is the first time I read J.L. Borges. The stories, somehow disturb me. Some are confusing, but all of them attract the reader because the are so well written and are full of memorable sentences. If you want to have a reference in latinamerican narrative you have to read Borges 
 I am a big fan of Woody Allen and I presume that I will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies.  Prior to viewing "What's New Pussycat?", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie.  However, "What's New Pussycat?" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie.  What is wrong with this movie is just about everything.  The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up.  We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees.  Peter O'Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women.  He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous.  He calls all his femine friends "pussycat" which gets old after a while.  He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates.  He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers.  Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with.  He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times.  Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture.  I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3.  With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10.  In "What's New Pussycat?", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes.  This overlong look into the problems that O'Toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick.  I take that back; there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey.  Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O'Toole's mistresses.  An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track.  (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track).  This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind.  After all, we have some top talent in Allen, Sellers and O'toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset (or the side of a building, or a mud puddle, or something meant to be funny).  I was glad to be done with the movie.  Woody Allen is a great talent.  Peter Sellers was a great talent.  Peter O'Toole was a great talent.  Watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made 
 I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet. 
 Its pretty poor quality, however, as shakey as this item is, its still hase not fallen apart..  so it gets a two 
 This is a mix of good, bad, and annoying  Good: the author really does know a lot about modeling (except data modeling, see "Bad") and gives good explanations and examples of many aspects of modeling at many stages in the development process. If you can plough through his 350+ pages, you will have found many stimulating and practical concepts and some good advice on implementing them.   A very good chapter is Chapter 29 - a discussion of how to implement Agile Modeling - or really, any agile practice - in a usually hostile world. Some battle scars showing here!   I also like that he does not consider the UML the be-all and end-all of modeling tools. Like him, I've found good use for the trusty old DFD (Data Flow Diagram) of the 70's, where appropriate.   And his overall message - that the agile approach can extend to your design and modeling task, not just code, and the implications for minimizing the documentation effort - is very strong.  I find his reference to quick diagrams "on the back of a napkin" a bit overdone. Sure, the quick informal diagram is excellent, but paper napkins are not the best medium!  Hand-drawn on a piece of paper, or a card, sure...how often are you discussing models in a bar - if you are, which kind of models are they..IT problems or "IT girls"..? ok, ok, end of PC violation...  Whiteboard and digital camera can certainly be used much more than they are. But the overall point is excellent: that when you are documenting (and he has some difficulty separating out "modeling" from "documenting" and acknowledges the problem) you are not creating the end-product, and there is a cost for that.  "Travel light" - yes. As Einstein said "Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler."   Bad: his data model example is terrible. What's with adding surrogate keys to every table? This is a pernicious practice that has become all too common from people who never learned relational theory and try to fit relational into the object model. A giveaway is that he calls his "identity" columns "persistent object identifiers."  Yes, sometimes they are necessary or useful, but in general the natural key is way better. In his Customer table, there is a customer number - but it's not the primary key, a pesky OID is! He himself acknowledges that this may give performance problems, or at least not be optimal. It implies more indexing and triggers...oh well, enough already. Just don't let RDBMS gurus like Fabian Pascal or Joe Celko see that chapter.   Slightly annoying: A few little niggles about English usage etc - by now you would think that any publisher's editor would know that "supersede" has no "c" in it, and that you can't be "reticent to" something - the word is "reluctant. Odd. On the other hand, thank goodness for someone who understands why it's "co-located" not the bizarre "collocated" that I see far too often.   Really annoying: Basically, Einstein's phrase above could have replaced about half the book. It's incredibly repetitious, and also over-organized, over-conceptualized, over-categorized, generally over-inflated. We need a discipline of Agile Communication! An end to ListMania! A thoroughgoing refactoring of the contents is in order. His four Parts and thirty Chapters contain massive redundancy. The matching of agile modeling precepts, in finest detail, to the equally excruciating detail of the RUP, is really an unnecessary exercise. We don't have TIME for this!   As someone else said, a short White Paper could have replaced the entire book.  Hence the two stars, good though some of the material is 
 This is one of the worst movies ever!!! It is so formulaic and boring. I can't believe the other comments recommending this movie. Dean Cain has NO charisma. I couldn't have cared what happened to him. If you want to see a real movie, get Layer Cake!! 
 It's very true that Bennett's prose is full of wonderful, vivid and often ironic commentary.  This book gives you a great sense of place to the "five towns" (based on the six towns that would become Stoke-on-Trent) from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth.  Detail is exactly right for time and place.  That makes it a rather interesting read.  However, there's next to no forward motion to this book. Two sisters lead divergent lives-- the beautiful one runs off with a hapless commercial traveler to Paris.  The dutiful one stays home, manages the shop, and marries the clerk.  But that's about it for drama.  Both sisters grow older, have some not very interesting stuff happen to them, then meet up again after a long time and end their lives together.  OK, Sophia, the beautiful one, does survive the siege of Paris, and become a manager/proprietress of a well-run pension. But somehow even this lacks drama.  Bennett is often praised for how well he wrote his women characters.  I disagree.  They are well observed it's true, and some of his projections about what they might feel-- when Constance, the dutiful one, faces "empty nest syndrome" so mournfull, for example-- are accurate.  But he imagines no real complexity for them.  Both women are extraordinarily passive in most ways.  The men in the book occupy far less time but manage to seem more human.  Compare and contrast JANE EYRE:  on the surface a rather prim, direct governess-- but as Bronte writes her, she has a passionate, vibrant beating heart.  In Bennett's world, women don't particularly long for sex nor care about it, nor think much about attachment at all.   I think it's very telling that Bennett was inspired by the sight of an older woman in a restaurant.  It was not a woman he knew, but a woman he saw.  He imagined everything else about her.  If the time and place is enough to draw you in, then this book certainly does have that, as the 600-something pages sprawl about 50 years.  But if you like a good narrative, apart from "people get older," look elsewhere.  The writing is very good, but although Bennett's often compared to Balzac and Zola, he lacks their punch-- and I also think, essentially lacks their heart 
 This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more 
 I purchased this book in hopes to have a reference guide for Iptables/Netfilter or even CheckPoint, but was sadly misled. The book covers only theory of how to build a firewall, while sighting no practical examples. It covers protocols, ports, and common types of security threats, but again gives no practical examples of how to write chains, tables or rules to prevent these attacks. If your a newbie to system administration you will learn quite a bit from this book, but if your a system admin such as I am looking for a reference guide THIS IS NOT I 
 As Mr. Lincoln once said, " People who like this sort of thing, will find this the sort of thing they like".  My wife, a fan and American Studies major, loved it. I on the other hand found myself wishing that Patrick O'Brian were still alive.  The first chapter is the best section of the book, but was basically meaningless since I do not believe that baseball embodies Mystical American Goodness.  You will like this book if you are a Delillo fan, or believe that the literary critics know something that you don't.  If not, life is short, find something else 
 I haven't received my subscription to Sunset magazine yet.  I can't review the actual magazine, but I can say they are very slow at getting new orders out 
 Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price 
 Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes.  The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche.  Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it.  Not a bad film, just not a good one 
 In a table of cable types early in the book, he lists cat 3 but not cat 5.  Otherwise, has a surprising amount of useful information, presented in a sometimes disorganized way 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I had high hopes for this series after reading the website.  Light His/Her Fire is flaunted as a replacement for marriage counselling.  If an audio cassette could fix every marriage, every marriage would be perfect.  The women's tapes suggest that the wife (or girlfriend) should give and give and forgive.  Although these are ideal attributes of a loving wife, each situation can be different and each husband is definitely different.  I listened to the women's tapes, but could not get my husband to listen to the men's tapes.  I was afraid to listen to the men's tapes for fear that I would resent him even more.  We finally saw a counsellor, who helped us a lot.  Our biggest help was from seeing our pastor.  He knew us better than the counsellor, so he was able to talk to US, not the typical wife and husband with problems.  I would not recommend buying this set at full price - it's a waste of money and could cause a divorce for spending that much without the spouse's consent.  A better relationship book is "Men are Like Waffles, Women are Like Spaghetti" 
 I recommend reading John Caddock's review in Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society, Vol. 10, #19 before purchasing this book.  According to Caddock, Manning places experientially based learning above scriptural truths instead of using God's Word as sideboards to understanding.  Caddock labels Manning's "contemplative spirituality" as dangerous.  I would tend to agree 
 I'm a new dad and received this title as a gift from a friend--thinking I might see "myself" in the book. My wife and I live and work in the Bay Area (the setting for the book), both hold down jobs (cost of living is outrageous here) and often feel utterly overwhelmed by trying integrate a new child into our lives and still make ends meet. I would give anything to have nothing more to do for an entire year than schleep my child down to Royal Grounds in the BabyBjorn every morning to people-watch and then go home to watch SportsCenter and eat PBJs. After a few chapters I wondered: "When does this guy go to work? And who's paying for those dinners at Chez Panisse?" This is not my reality at all nor of any parent I know. And that peeing in a cup business is just gross. 
 I have used these books for about ohh... 4 years now, and since I have started using them my standerdized test scores have droped from just above avrage to well below avrage... I do not believe anyone should use them 
 The recording mechanics on this CD were terrible, painful feedback at low volume. There seemed to be no theme to this CD,it was a waste of money 
 Not a single photo ! Just a few sketches and a lot of talk. Save your money 
 Very underwhelming. If you knew *nothing*, this might be a mediocre starting point, but there are so many other great resources on thyroid disease.  You deserve better than this book.  Like is short.   "Thyroid Power" or "Fat, Fuzzy, or Frazzled", Mary Shomon's books and similar books are *crammed* with helpful scientific information.  Also "Mood cure" is a great book worth checking out. 
 I was drawn to this book by reading the back cover.  How could anything revolving the story about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce be anything but good.  I didn't even mind the battle between christian and pagan religions.  It just seemed that whenever the Templars got in trouble they pulled out their Celtic stone, said some prayers and all was well.  I was given the second book and will attempt to slog my way through it as I travel, however, I am so far not impressed 57 pages into it.  I wish that the execution of this story and plot could have been done better as the idea was fantastic.  I enjoyed some of the historical points of the book, but as written in earlier reviews they were repeated entirely too many times!  I wouldn't buy this book if your looking for a fun, romping tale of the Knights Templar.  Could have been much better 
 I bought this book expecting it to be as wonderful as French Chic by fashion writer Suzanne Somer (unfortunately out of print) or A Year of Style by Frederic Fekkai.  Unfortunately, this book is filled with dated clothing and very little substance to explain the French fashion mystique.  However, there are two other great books that are keepers.  The first is Frederic Fekkai: A Year of Style.  The famous French stylist does an excellent job of showing you how to be beautiful with easy and simple ideas to use throughout the year. The second book is A Guide to Elegance: For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions by Geneviere Antonine Dariaux.  Madame Genevieve Antoine Dariaux, former directrice for Nina Ricci shares her extensive expertise on creating the classic French look 
 This book and every other book on self help topics are endless rephrasings of Jesus statement - " Ask and you shall receive ". Why we read these books? Because we are in need. And IF WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OUR NEED IS THIS SAME NEED WE SHALL RECEIVE. We are always what we are conscious of. That's so simple like that. When I AM conscious of being rich, I AM rich in that very moment. In SPIRIT and so, IN TRUTH, I AM rich. That's all. The proof that I am rich is my total joy and gratefulness. Money in my bank account will materialize soon after, but, first, money must be a fact in spirit. The same with health, relationships, etc. Try this: suppose you are feeling depressed and anxious. Be conscious you are the most happiest person in the world. Right now. Feel  happy beyond your wildest dreams. Not that you will be, but that YOU ARE NOW. And you are. That's all. So, feel you are rich right now. And you are. Apparent money will appear soon in your bank. Ask IS receive. But asking in the conscious of the need is receive the... need - the very thing one is conscious of. Each new book you read about materializing your desires is a proof that you are conscious of your needs and that is your asking and what you receive. This is so simple that you need to be as a little child to believe 
  Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary. I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.   Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.   
 I didn't know what to expect from this CD. But my first reaction was, especially when the first piece was Bach, that it was one of those hooked-on baroque music productions. Other compositions were interesting but these techno arranged classicals were mediocre at best. It was a bit 'cheesy'. However, if you rarely listen to instrumental music, you just might enjoy this CD 
 BORING.  I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book 
 Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad.   I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this.   Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 This book reads like a period piece, with about as much connection with current reality as a Victorian book of manners--except, of course, it is rude and abraisive.  Even in its heyday, the Manifesto was a measure of wheat in a mountain of techno-pyscho-babble, quasi-Marxian, what-we really-need-is-to-just-sit-around-and-rap chaff.  Now that the Internet is largely a tool to make customer service and contact even more difficult that before (ever try to use the "knowledge base" of most companies?) it look even quainter.  All I could think of was Webvan and the mass of uneconomic ventures that these and like fantasies spawned.  Don't bother.  Read David Ogilvy instead 
 This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego 
  i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star. 
 Sandford has done his best to be "fair" to the insufferable and untalented Paul McC.   And yet he bends over backwards (or maybe forwards) to say nice things about the even less talented Linda and even seems to have a soft spot for Heather Mills (Milks) McCartney, who has become a spokesman for IHOP recently.     When will somebody come along and really tell the truth about this bozo?   
 I finished this book fairly quickly, and I came away from it feeling like I had a decent overview of the atmosphere in America during 1968, but that I had not learned anything other than the basic facts of what went on.  In  my opinion, Kaiser fails to go in-depth enough into any one subject (except  the McCarthy campaign) to give the reader a true understanding of what it  must have felt like to be there.  I was born in 1982, so I was not there,  and I still feel like I lack an understanding of the attitudes and events  of the time.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the title is  misleading.  This book is not about music or the counterculture or really  even  the shaping of a generation.  It is about the presedential campiagn  of 1968, and specifically the McCarthy campaign.  If someone wanted a more  of a cultural account that is specific and goes in depth into the feelings  and conflicting spirits that characterized that turbulent year, I would  recommend they look elsewhere, as I will 
 After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 everyone who has rated this film over 1-star is involved in the making of this crappy movie. Click on the link to see their other reviews... where are they?!!  this movie is absolutely terrible. If you can handle more than ten minutes of it, you're a tougher man than m 
 They sent me wrong lens cover and said I ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since I got copy.......poor customer service all around..... 
 this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american 
 The books makes one wonder what happened to the editor. It rambles, it's melodramatic and I simply couldn't force myself to finish it 
 As an avid reader I am always looking for a new "great read". I love books about England and therefore, was excited to start reading this book. Alas, the title is misleading, there is nothing "Great" about this book. It just plain stinks. There should be a monetary reward for anyone who can wade through this muck. It is poorly conceived, more poorly written and will bore you to tears. Don't waste your time or money on this stinker 
 The desciption does not mention that the product is not to be used with URL coated lenses, which is a serious omission given that many or even most eyeglass lenses are coated 
 Great subject; poor execution. Starr is so determined to prove his point that people have the capacity to determine their historical decisions that he forces the facts of his arugment to fit his theory. There are some perfect moments of pure contradiction here. My favorite is the chapter on radio, where he concedes that maybe the technical limitations of media determines the process of their deployment in society, only to dismiss it with an offhand, "of course that can't be the case." The book is also hobbled by a limp wrist embrace of American exceptionalism, as though the geographic, social and class context of America weren't enough to account for difference between the deployment of technology in America and Europe. No, it HAS to be the genius of our political institutions. There are at least three great stories here: How the aesthetic conventions of media determine historical consicousness (a la McLuhan), the role of media in price revolutions, and how media is used as a tool in class and ethnic competition. But Starr misses all of them either because he has an agenda when he gets to the facts, or because doing political history is easy, and economic history hard. Either way, lame. For bourgeois historians only. If you're a media professional, pass 
 I saw a bit of an interview with the author on Book TV and got this. I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.  My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from.   I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously

  The  book is more like a treatise for a  doctorate. It is probably suitable for  college credits in Mystery Shopping  but definitely not recommmended for a newbie. There is nothing SIMPLE about its content I found it overwhelming.  
 Wow.  I thought because OK Computer was such a good album this book would probably be pretty good.   But then I read it.  The writing is so stale and unemotional that the author is unable to actually articulate what the album means to anyone.  Instead, she uses chords and stupid bpm graphs to talk about the songs and othing about their emotional weight.  Plain and simple, This book SUCKED don't waste your money on it.  Buy the one on Let it Be by the Replacemnts instead 
 Oh my...I have owned this book since before I even moved to California.  I'm glad I didn't let this book's terrible quality stop me from moving to the mineral wonderland that is California.  The problem with this book is that it is just small scale maps of california with freaking NUMBERS plopped all over some map.  Ok, thanks a LOT for the number 14 (QUARTZ =) over Quartz Hill in Palmdale...yes, it IS made out of Quartz...massive white quartz.  The ONLY way this book is of ANY use is if you were to use it in conjunction with other maps and even then, there are scores of better works to choose from on the subject.  Don't waste your time 
 ahhh I see your battery is dying.  Be forewarned.  I'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  I mean really how old is your phone?  Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  The Li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)  why hasn't yours lasted that long... oh because your phone sucks.  you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby.  Why?  have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running?  it is cooking its internal electronics, your ear, and the battery.  when you get a new phone - the new one will only have a 90day warranty.  T-mobile will charge you for shipping.  you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone.  aren't these costs adding up for you yet 
 Yeah so my dad got me the first book when I was like...15. I successively bought each book as it was printed, and loved them all.  Despite the poor reviews I don't necessarily feel the last one was slow moving, at least not any more or any less than the first three.  Cherryh's lyrical gift is rivalled in the fantasy realm only by Guy Gavriel Kay, who does a SLIGHTLY clearer job with  creating "visible" imagery.  The premise is great, the language is great, the dialogue and characters are great, each having unique personalities.  I'm 23 now and I've read the series again and again, hoping to find something I missed.  But unlike any other conclusion I have ever seen, it doesn't actually end anything, it's not even a cliff hanger.  The details of dialogue and interaction seem to have dribbled off and failed at the final page, with a slight nod in the direction of an ending in a cryptic letter from Tristen to Cefwyn. Sadly, though the writing is mostly gorgeous, I can't recommend it to anyone.  For analytical poetry I read Dylan Thomas or Edmund Spenser.  Art, entertainment, whatever it may be, give me a solid ending 
 There is a good core message in this book about the "right" way to eat... and you'll read it over and over and over again. This way waaaay more information than I needed and could honestly have been covered in a pamphlet. Check it out at the library 
 I bought this book from a traditional brick & mortar store, big mistake, I should have come here first to read the reviews!   First Ms. Talbott starts with a basic idea,  place your largest piece of furniture in front of the  architechtual focal point of the room.  For the average person this is going to be the fireplace or large windows.  If you look at Ms. Talbott's drawings she completely ignores her own advice, unless of course the architechtual focal point of the room is a corner (as shown on the cover of the book).  It generally isn't and when a page later you realize she placed it this way because she places the TV on that corner (contrary to her own advice of not making the TV the focal point of any room) you realize why she did this.  I found this annoying, she contradicted herself twice.   I realize the drawings are really just to give you an idea and everyone's home is going to be different, but no one has an architechtual focal point in a corner, more than likely it's going to be on that long wall or the wall opposite.  So what should you take from this?  Place your largest piece of furniture in front of your architectual focal point and start from there. There I've saved you $15 bucks.  As for the rest of the book it all seemed kind of commen sense to me (and anyone who watches HGTV), grouping art on a wall, following the architectual line of a wall with your art,layering accessories, and rearranging furniture in other rooms of the house e.g. bedrooms, which her advice boiled down to ignore focal points and place the bed where it will fit uh-duh 
 We need a one-volume history of European Integration, but not this five hundred page panegyric to...Margaret Thatcher?  In Gillingham's funhouse, Thatcher is the key figure in European Integration, receiving more attention than any of the individuals who actually tried to integrate Europe, most of whom are dismissed, often in very personal terms.  European integration indeed disappears from the book sometimes for sixty pages at a time while the author reviews political developments of right-wing governments in...New Zealand?  A very distorted understanding of European integration 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.  
 Unless you are a child of an alcoholic or grew up in this type of environment, I would not recommend this book. There are other types of dysfunctional families but they are not discussed in as much detail as alcoholics 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 I bought a few of these on Amazon thinking that it would be nice as gifts. I tried one at home first, since I hate breaking out the rice cooker to make rice for 1 person.   I followed the directions, and put it in the microwave. I ended up with hard undercooked rice, and a mess in my microwave. The water boiled over and went everywhere, and since it is rice water, it was starchy and hard to clean. Now I have 2 unopened boxes waiting for the Salvation Army. What a waste.. 
 It kills me to say this but its true, I did find it dissapointing. I loved the previous two books (the first one particuarly) but this one has so many pics that make me cringe and a lot of the recipes are almost identical to ones in previous books. Also there seems to be lots of versions of different things so you might have 3 potato salads recipes for example. I've tried a few recipes from this and they have been lacking on the taste side. Also its true too many are from other people.  Go out and buy how it all vegan instead (if you don't have it already).  Edited to add: not as bad I thought i've since tried the borscht and the lentil and quinoa stew and they both rock.  
 "Children of the Corn" had some potential: a "corn" cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in Nebraska. Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as "Alan Smithee," the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear. This Anchor Bay DVD is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound, though this is not the director's cut. 
 Anytime you overlook Molly Hatchet & Blackfoot when your talking Southern Rock, you overlook a major portion of the hard drivin, butt thumpin down south style 
 This entire series of "Incredibly Easy" books should be called "Incredibly Boring"!  I've found all of them to be useless in keeping my attention or in helping me to remember.  There is nothing memorable about anything in these books 
 The pan doesn't have a non-stick coating so the rice sticks (go figure). Not a bad brand from what I hear - I just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating 
 I wasn't too impressed about this book as many other reviewers were. The only positive thing I can say about this book is for its style. Obviously, Leo Tolstoy is well-known for his novel epics, WAR AND PEACE, and ANNA KARENINA, and also for his short stories (some which I've read and enjoyed). But from reading this book I didn't really see that brilliant storyteller. The book is more like a biography about a fictional character and his death than an actual story. Of course we as the reader get the universal ideas of death (such as "better him than me" attitude, "Why do i deserve to die this way God?" etc.), and as someone who has recently overcome the lost of a family member, I can relate. But to me I found this book boring and pointless to read (thank goodness it was a NOVELLA!). I don't really see how other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I mean it was a well-written book and all, but nothing worth bragging about, and it's definitely NOT Tolstoy's best work. 
 Andre Norton and Rosemary Edghill's _Leopard in Exile_ is the sequel to _The Shadow of Albion_, which I thought was rather entertaining. Sadly, _Leopard in Exile_ is not. The world's magical structure is poorly worked out; it's a mishmash of elements from British faery lore, Native American beliefs, Satanistic black magic, and even Arthurian legend (the Holy Grail). The plot is absurdly contrived, the alternate history unconvincing (why would the American colonies under the Stuarts be more friendly to the native Americans than they were under Hanoverian rule?), and the characters poorly fleshed out. There's almost nothing of the relationship between Wessex and Sarah which was forged in the first book, just a lot of agonizing about how much they love each other, with very little interaction between them which shows rather than tells. Wessex's desperate search for Sarah, who has gone to the New World to help her friend Meriel, is a driving force behind much of the plot, but as there seems to be no depth to their relationship, it's next to impossible to feel any urgency about the search.  And worst of all, the narrative includes footnotes, which are very difficult to use effectively in fiction without distracting the reader from the flow of the action; here, they are overly self-conscious, frequently patronizing (the note explaining the bill which abolished slavery in Britain and its dominions ends "Aren't you glad I'm here to tell you these things?"), often useless (defining a recaumier as "A couch to you", when it's clear from the context anyway), and generally aggravating. Do we really need a reference to a web site about jambalaya when it's served to one of the characters? Surely not. I cannot imagine what the authors (or their editor) could have been thinking to include these idiotic, distracting notes.  I still think _The Shadow of Albion_ was worth reading, but by all means, avoid the sequel. (Hey, and I didn't even mention the gratuitous Star Wars reference or the meaningless appearance of a character from one of Edghill's other books - duly noted in the footnotes, of course). 
 Sorry, I have to disagree with the favorable reviews about this movie. The character development was not good, the editing in some scenes poor, and the action was...sloppy. I really tried to like the movie because I'm a big fan of Chanbarra film, but Ronin Gai will never be placed in my 'must have' catagory. It does not possess the quality or class of any Akira Kurosawa samurai epic. 
 This book is way too technical for the average photographer looking to get started using infrared film. Too many charts that only confuse and don't translate to in the field shooting. The images are also poorly composed and  not creative. A waste of money 
 At 624 pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestle's book does contain some good information, it doesn't live up to it's bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book (a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently) and Nestle's odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the book's practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weil's Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative. 
 I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting.. 
 If you are a teenager or student in your early 20s and are fascinated with the big mysterious world of I-Banking, this book is for you. It starts from ground zero and provides a cursory explanation of what investment banking is, along with some guidance on career paths in the field.  If you are anyone else, forget it. As I struggled to maintain interest, I couldn't help but be reminded of a scene from the movie "Back to School", where Paxton Whitehead plays a B-school professor lecturing his class on how to start a business and Rodney Dangerfield plays a veteran businessman with no formal education. As Whitehead's character is pontificating about the nuances of how global interest rates affect the construction costs that a hypnothetical business will incur, Dangerfield's character can't help but blurt out "Why in the world would you build when you can rent in this market for half a buck a square foot and let someone else have the headaches of property management?". It quickly becomes apparent that the real-world experience of Dangerfield's character is far more useful than the off-topic theoretical knowledge of the professor. This author reminds me of Whitehead's character: Thoroughly vetted in academia and obviously having zero experience in the real world, and thus having zero useful real-world insight to share with his readers.  The most-cited references in the chapter bibliographies are the annual reports of the big I-banks, and the rest of the book is written at the same naieve, glossy-overview level.  In summary, if you want to know what it's like to serve in the Navy, you can get yourself a copy of the Navy's glossy brochure on what Navy careers are supposed to be like, or you can find a vet who's been in the Navy to tell you what it's really like. Reading this book is like reading the Navy's glossy brochure. 
 THE MOVIE KICK@SS!!!! HOWEVER, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD... STICK WITH PREVIOUS 1 Disc Set DVD... It's exactly same DVD except... Disc 2 contains M:I:III Trailer and WE-LOVE-TOM-CRUISE STUFF... A BIG WASTE!! 
 This is the first review I have ever taken the time to leave, I feel that strongly about this album.  I don't buy many CDs but when Incubus came out with their new one I knew I had to have it.  Make Yourself and Morning View are 2 of my all-time favorites and can listen to them every day.  I read the other reviews ahead of time and it seemed like I would be assured of liking Crow as much as the others.  I was shocked to be so disappointed the first time I listened to it after liking the previous 2 albums so much.  After Megalomaniac I wanted to skip through most of the rest.  The Incubus sound has certainly changed on this release but that is not the problem.  It is terribly boring with nothing to hook you in to most songs.  No catchy beats or melodies. They all just seem to drone on to me, nothing that you want to sing to or get stuck in your head.  Other than the opening track there was not one song I wanted to hear again.  Obviously I am in the minority since there are a lot of reviews which average 4 stars but to me this is just a really diappointing effort from what used to be my favorite band. 
 This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier: 1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion. 2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top. I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them. On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of. 
 Oh boy. I wish I didn't have to finish every book. It is just a pet peeve of mine. However, I couldn't get into this book. I see no clear theme. I know everyone was horrified at 9/11, however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse. What happens to all the characters? One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over 
 Though the instrumental performance is adequate, I was quite disappointed with the choral performance in the requiem.  The group's diction is not together, several of the soloists are weak, and the overall balance of choir and orchestra is not even 
 OK, John Mayer, whoop-whoop; I saw him on "Austin City Limits" awhile back, and I (AND my Wife, too!) thought it was Nelson Mandela's step-son, Dave Matthews.  And now, he's gone and 86'd Jessica ("What...ME worry?") Simpson, too.  "Fifteen Munutes of Fame," Johnny...OK, all THAT aside: I don't know who Mayer is (ahem) "cozy" with, because, like Johnny Lang and the aforementioned Matthews, he HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY.  And, again: all THAT aside, how did this @#$% manage to get the Who's bass player and Keef's drummer to provide the thythm section for this mess?  Save your money,or go buy Tony Joe White's newest CD 
 The first and second editions are much different, but the search for Principles of Human Evolution yields only the first, and way outdated edition (published six years before the second edition).  Amazon needs to do something about this 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all!  Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow. Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line.  Kids will love it 
 It would be hard to come up with a more brain-dead characterization of the peoples of the world than to lump them into "us", Americans, and "them", all the other peoples of the world.  Yet Churchill and Chomsky and most others who mistake their anti-Americanism for leftism consistently start from that mindlessly provincial premise.  Are the folks who hate us the Australians?  Well, no.  Our British allies?  Well, not them either.  The Chinese, many of whom are so eager to get green cards to study or live here?  Those I met were often conscious that Chinese prosperity is founded upon US willingness to open its markets to their goods.  In sharp contrast to European protectionism.  How about the Indians, for whom holders of US citizenship or greencard status are almost a new subcaste for marital matchmaking?  The Canadians hate us, do they?  Though it is hard for anyone to tell us apart?  Perhaps the Greeks, Poles, Italians, and Irish hate us, which is why they eagerly tell American tourists about their cousins in Baltimore or Chicago?  Surely the Russians, Ukrainians, and inhabitants of other former Soviet countries hate us?  Except for attributing their freedoms and the beginnings of their new prosperity to our victory over the Soviet Union?  How about the Filipinos - surely they must despise us for ruling them as a colony?  Well no.  They learn in school that the US without violence or even prompting made the Philippines independent in 1935 and rescued them from Japanese occupation during WWII, and they too, often have relatives in the US.  Surely the Thais, must hate us - but no, their story is much the same as the Chinese.  And on and on, around the world.    The Arabs surely must hate us.  Except for the Shi'ite majority of Iraqis who recognize that we have just freed them from decades of bloody Baathist suppression of their religion and folkways.  And the Lebanese must hate us, except for those who love their country and are delighted with American support for driving the decades-old Syrian military occupation out of their country.  But Churchill and Chomsky are right that there are those who do hate us.  Palestinians and Egyptians danced in the streets when they learned that 3,000 Americans died in New York on 9-11.  The attackers themselves were Saudis and products of the Wahhabbi system of religious bigotry and xenophobia which passes for education and news in that country.    The "they" who hate us, when examined, turn out to be not the whole world, not the whole Muslim world, and not even the whole Arab world, but only the most racist, bigoted, and xenophobic portions of it.  And those are the people whom Ward Churchill and Noam Chomsky and their supporters identify with 
 I'm giving it two stars, though it may deserve one more, to balance out the rave reviews by others.  Take warning, this book is not what it appears to be.  The cover looks appealing, the subtitle is misleading.  There are better books to help you "discover greater creativity and artistic confidence."  (One is Paint Happy by Cristina Acosta.)  This book is mostly about keeping artistic track of your travels throughout the world in the form of a creative journal.  It does also include ideas for making business meetings more entertaining--i.e., by drawing your colleagues--but many of those ideas may not appeal to  stay-at-home or housewife types of people (which I am).  About half of the activities are less exotic, but there were too many exotic or really boring ones for my taste.  The book is not set up very well.  The chapter titles are clear enough, but the pages are sort of mushy looking.  It is not easy to tell at a glance if the page is a project page or a sample of other peoples' art page; it doesn't seem to have many projects.  The main media used in the book were drawing and watercolor.  The collage section was kind of nice.  Most of the projects are for pages in your creative journal, not for paintings you might want to hang up somewhere, but she does show you how to develop some the ideas into paintings, which is nice.  All in all though, this book just didn't appeal to me.  It should have been crammed full of fun ideas and it wasn't.  My advice is to look through the book completely before you buy it because it is an expense and it takes up space 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 Doesn't address this model.  Just higher-end ones.  Waste of money 
 This is a shorter, much simplified version of the original story that was published by Pantheon books in 1983.  I'm not sure what the point was in making a simplified version, since the complete story of Cornelius was my son's favorite when he was 3 years old.  I'd skip this version and go with the original 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 This film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, Pride and Prejudice.  It represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and Austen novels; however, it is not great in terms of adaptation.  If you love Pride and Prejudice and have never seen this film, skip it.  It will only anger you.  If you're studying film adaptation of Austen novels, you MUST see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards.  AND--it's Laurence Olivier, afterall 
 I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this.  The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each.  It's not a deal at all.  If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it.  Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these.  Why would I want more than one copy of a movie 
 It has been my experience over the past several years of buying and reading White Wolf's various World of Darkness books, that the core rulebooks get most of the talent that White Wolf possesses on its staff.  They have by far the best artwork, and more importantly, best editing.  They are finely balanced and intricate, as well as always thought-provoking.  They are written as stand alones, which brings me to the White Wolf supplement books like Guide to the Camarilla.  The supplement books from White Wolf are usually not even close to the quality standard of the core books.  This is true in the case of Guide to the Camarilla.  This book is essentially a catch-all for much of the miscellaneous material from earlier editions of Vampire the Masquerade that failed to make it into the Revised core rulebook.  I do not find that the material in this Guide adds much of anything to the Camarilla material in the core book, which is very well presented.  In fact, it undoes much of what the Revised rules tried to do to re-make the game as a more streamlined and elegant roleplayer.  More is not necessarily better, and that maxim is certainly true of this supplement 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 Let's face it: When you want to get started you don't sit down, read through 800 pages, then get to it.  What you really do is read a little, skimming what you really need to get started. When you need to know something, you look it up.  There's the rub.  Unfortunately, ALL of these books suffer from the problem of having a very bad index.  I know the index spans many pages, however, I have seldom found ANYTHING I wanted by looking it up under the obvious heading.  For that matter, often the subject is not to be found anywhere in the index at all.  Which means it either isn't covered in the book, or it can not be found easily.  The "9 in 1" books thing sounds good, until you realize that there is not necessarily an integrated approach to really teaching the whole of Access and the relationship between its parts.  The real problem is that Access is layered on top of 3 'languages' (VB, SQL, and Macros) and has different ways of getting things done for its three main parts (Queries, Forms, and Reports).  (And VB even supports 2 different object models, DAO and ADO.) It is often unlclear how all these different areas interact.  They can interact together easily, but why is a function spelled one way in an expression, a different way in VB and again different in SQL?  There ought to be a cross reference table translating between them.  Or when can you nest aggregate functions and when can't you?  Much of what Access is secretly doing is translating your groupings and expressions into SQL with Unions and inner/outer-joins or what not.  None of this inner working is explained, leaving you clueless when Access refuses to do what it thinks you want to do.  Yes, Access is a confusing product owing to the way different parts were cobbled together.  But it can also be very easy to do certain things, like turning a report's groupings inside out.  Some of these things are explained in this book, but most are not.  A comprehensive index would be a start, but they would of course need the text to go with it.  You'll have better luck finding specific information by searching on the internet.  I have found many great and helpful web sites, but I still haven't found any one book on MS Access that comes close to really explaining it properly.  And none with an even decent index.  It sounds great to read on a book's jacket that it will cover VB or XML or web stuff, but the important stuff is often overlooked. 
 As a big fan of the 20 or so L. M. Montgomery books I've read and re-read, I was so excited to finally find a copy of this book. But when I started reading it I was really disappointed. I know this book was published posthumously and wondered if maybe she hadn't had time to polish the stories in it. Basically, I found it boring; one or two stories I couldn't even bother to finish, and others I've never re-read. None of the stories were wholly satisfying; each lacked something of the charm and entertainment of her previous short stories; those that started well ended flat.  Another reviewer mentioned that they didn't find L.M. Montgomery's previous short stories satisfying, but I enjoyed the style of those earlier ones, which is perhaps why I didn't like these; they really have a different flavour to her other stories, although she still includes a number of her common themes 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 I bought this because a few people had put it in their Amazon lists.  I just didn't like it at all.  It is one of those albums where you play it, and you don't take notice of it until the CD stops playing.  It is very old and the music is simplistic.  Cool cover though 
 This book is a good reference to have on the shelf. I would not recommend reading it or buying it unless you have nothing else to do 
 I'm surprised that such a shallow, heavy-handed book was considered publishable.  From the start, the book pounds the reader with the main character's "double life" without a trace of grace or subtilty.  It reads like "young adult" fiction, except that it doesn't have any likable characters.  The one interesting result of reading this book is to see how such a potentially interesting topic like bigamy can be so boring when addressed by an incompetent writer 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 This verse summarizes the spiritual condition of Mr. Conehead.  1Jo 4:20  If anyone says "I love God" and yet hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar, because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.  Mr. Cone uses Christianity as his platform to spew hate against white people.  Sad. 
 The two stars go in honor of the questions asked early in the book, which do suggest many useful things to include in your statement.  Very quickly, however, the book takes a one-way street that only the extreme cases can follow.  The example essays include people who have escaped the communist regime of Cuba, been haunted by the Russian KGB, lived in a car, and an Olympic Skier.  If you do have an extreme tear-jerker for the academy, buy this book--but that is the only style of essay discussed.  If you happen to be among the average applicants, though, and you trying to get an edge, this may not be the right place to look.  I am applying to Public Health school, and found more useful info in a book on getting into Law schools.  I would suggest checking out the Degree of Difference Series over this book 
 I picked up a bargain copy of this at a bookstore and was glad I hadn't paid full price for it. The topic is interesting to me as I love eating at fine-dining restaurants, but this book was not a worthwhile exploration of that topic. I was hoping for the kind of insider scoop on restaurant operations you get from, say, Anthony Bourdain's books. Instead, this is all about how you, the lowly restaurant-going peasant, should suck up to hosts, waiters and chefs because what they do is soooo cool and you are soooo not worthy of their time and effort. I kept thinking of the term "scenester" when I read this - someone who is so interested in getting into the "hot" place du jour that they'll do anything short of humiliating themselves to get inside. The whole tone of the book is fawning towards chefs and restaurant owners/personnel and there's not really a lot of "insider" information here that you couldn't figure out for yourself. And the book is overcomplimentary towards restaurant people in the extreme. Shaw's book makes it seem like if a restaurant treats a customer poorly, it's obviously the customer's fault because fine restaurants run by celebrated chefs are pinnacles of perfection and couldn't possibly do anything wrong. It seemed to me like Shaw mainly wrote this book to give props to his chef friends and get accolades from people in the business for writing a book that made them look so good, and therefore get nsider access to even more chefs/restaurateurs (and free gourmet meals, of course). I don't think there was an honest intention here to give any kind of real "inside" story.  I agree with the reviewer who said this book is a lot like the discourse you'll find on eGullet, pretentious and self-righteously obsessed with details the average person could care less about. I couldn't even finish reading this. Another book for the charity pile, although frankly I feel bad about inflicting this on anyone else 
 If you know anything about Marilyn, you will be annoyed by this movie.  Many of the details are incorrect including costumes and Marilyn's appearance in earlier films. They had Marilyn as a platinum blonde in "Don't Bother to Knock" and "Asphalt Jungle." Wrong-she was blonde, but not platinum just yet!  It is unfortunate that this movie will be a first look at Marilyn for some people.  She is misrepresented as a person with multiple personalities and as an IV drug user. The one star is for Ashley Judd, Mira Sorvino however, doesn't look or sound anything like Marilyn.  
 i'm a little confused as to the book description. it says "This condition is world wide due to exposure of chemicals and toxins." does the author try to prove trans people are like teenage mutant ninja turtles 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green.  STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuf 
 I was very disappointed in the content of Dr. Rosenfelds book on alternative health.  It is clear to me that the millions of Chiropractic patients are more educated about Chiropractic than Dr. Rosenfeld himself.   With 66,000 licensed Chiropractors in the United States alone, the terms "alternative" have an ever-changing meaning.  I would not recommend this book to anyone searching for non-biased information on Chiropractic, or other "alternatives" 
 This "simplification" book was written by a woman whose idea of simplifying is driving a BMW and getting her exercise by taking walks on the beach.  That is unless she is walking in the park, then she will let her dog sniff for a while and then leave him in a hot parked car to finish her "brisk" one mile walk herself.  The entire first half of the book seems to be talking you into "getting started" simplifying your life.  If I needed talked into it, I wouldn't have bought the book now would I?  Also during this time, she states that you must do whatever it takes to free up time to "start" this process including lying to your boss by using sick days when you are obviously not sick.  Apparently, marriage is also not a sacred thing to Ms. St. James as there were several references to it being possibly beneficial to dump your mate or your spouse due to incompatibility in the simplification area.  Yes, she used the word ..... DUMP!  To curtail your spending habits, she suggests keeping a 30 day list with you and when you see something you want, don't buy it right away but write it down on your list along with the day's date.  If you look at your list 30 days from then and still want it, then it's okay to buy it.  My advice?  Forget the list ...... wait a month.  If you can't remember wanting it, you didn't really need it in the first place!  Most disturbing was her obvious disregard for others.  Here's her advice on declining an invitation to a party or other social function:  "There'll be enough people who show up because they want to be there, so you don't need to feel YOU have to.  Of course, if no one shows up at all, perhaps it's an indication that the gathering wasn't necessary in the first place."  Here's her advice for turning down a neighbor's invitation for coffee:  "Put your foot down and keep putting it down until they get the picture. 'Blanche, I'm starting a new project next week and won't be able to do coffee with you for a while.  I'll give you a call when my schedule frees up.'  When Blanche shows up anyway, be firm and persistent.  'Blanche, maybe I didn't make myself clear the other day, but remember I'm starting my new schedule today.  I don't have time to visit now.  I'll call you later.'"  What happens, Ms. St. James, if Blanche is an old woman who lived for that daily companionship?  For just a half hour or so of your time to know that someone cared?  Her advice for staying in touch by phone is to inform everyone you know to leave messages on machines rather than picking up the phone and actually talking to each other ..... that would apparently be a waste of time (think of it as audio E-mail she says).  There is also a frightening letter included in the book from a 14 year old boy who was obviously searching for the meaning of life and battling depression and the advice he got from one of her books was to "look inside himself for strength and to get in touch with his inner self."  She informs us that she is an avid reader and has an extensive book collection which I would hazard a guess doesn't contain a Bible!      
 The idea of a quantum computer is quite fascinating. Since a colleague of mine studied quantum computing at Oxford, I thought I might read up on the subject. My expectations were that "The Quest" would be something that would get the lay reader up to speed. I don't mind being stretched a bit (I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering), but the book was just way too over the top for any not intimately familiar with quantum physics. The book contains a lot of interesting information, but it is sandwiched between some very difficult concepts and nomenclature. Remember, "know your audience . . . 
 Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I saw Jessica Hagedorn speak at the 92nd street Y, which is where I recieved her book. Once I began to read the book I became absorbed into her book. Jessica Hagedorn does a good job at describing the essence of the bohemian/ punk rock culture. My only problem was that the book became really confusing once in the middle. The beginning of the book was straight forward and easy to read, but once Rocky becomes pregnant , the whole book seems confusing. The book became really boring once it got to a certain point, and I became really dissapointed 
 The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best. 
 anybody who is a true 2pac fan will understand that this album would leave 2pac rolling around in his grave. 2pac would never have worked with artists like eminem or elton john and what is even more sickening is the clear distortion of his voice to fit in with eminems beats. These are not songs that 2pac would have ever produced himself, does not even have a familiar 2pac feel or vibe. Anyone purchasing this album is only making eminem richer and defaming 2pac's legacy as far as I am concerned. People who disagree should listen to 2pac's original albums and then understand what i am talking about. This album is an embarassment to somebody as great as 2pac 
 This collection of 100 or so newspaper columns is probably the worst material I have read of Thompson's. First of all, it starts OK, but then turns into a liberal rant for the last half of the book. In almost all cases, Thompson's wild and repeated predictions about the fall of Republicans never come to pass. In fact, not one of them came true.  It is a shame that a man with such insidious ability to write from the gut would allow himself to slide into the dark, slimy Left side of politics, all the while failing to report-much less admit-that the Left was as much if not more corrupt than the Right.  I would pass this tome of incoherent bloviating. His other works are far superior to this wasted cache of paper 
 Thought it would be great, but actually scared my dog and when he got over his fear he was unable to get near enough to play with it. Needless to say he did not get enjoyment out of it. Can't recomend 
 We thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement. Our favorite part was when her grandmother came over. Our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer 
 Your body and you control what goes in your mouth.  Your choice how you take care of it.  Your great grandparents were pretty smart.  Lived a long time and the doctor was never around nor was he needed. 
 There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow.  Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it 
 While the original film was great and is one of my all-time favcorites, this sequel in no way comes up to the same standards of humor or storyline.  In fact, it comes off as a blatant attempt to squeeze a few more dollars off of the original films followers.  You don't need to believe me. Try renting it before you put down hard-earned cash on this wannabe...     
 This man is like Michael Bay.  Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies.  The man is a joke 
 This is a review of the audio book version.  This has to be the worst self- help audio book I've bought.  I thought this was going to be a reading of the book, but instead the author rambles on and on - apparently paraphrasing the book.  I guess its supposed sound like a friend talking to you but I kept getting annoyed at the author repeating herself two or three times.  And where were the 100 tips?  I guess the were in there, but I couldn't listen to more than a couple tapes.  Don't waste your money... there are MUCH better books out there that give you useful, concrete steps for uncluttering and simplifying your life 
 I was expected more model of the book but the whole book only teached one model 
 Awesome table of contents.  Gives you a smattering of everything.  A special strength is the section on Arcnet, the hot technology of 1979, that some of us are still using.  However the book doesn't really get you up to speed in anything in particular.  You'll still need to dive into deeper waters like those in Charles E. Spurgeon's _Ethernet: The Definitive Guide,_ Thomas Maufer's _IP Fundamentals: What Everyone Needs To Know About Addressing & Routing,_ and Rich Seifert's _The Switch Book._  Does not cover Windows XP 
 This book was a HUGE disappointment. The author has some kind of strange obession with Norma Shearer. He makes numerous idiot statments. He refers to all of the other major movie stars (such as Clara Bow, Jean Harlow, Myna Loy) as just minor background players...umm NOOO. This man obviously knows very little about cinema. I kept waiting and waiting throughout the book for him to stop talking and praising Norma Shearer, but he never did. Yes, Norma Shearer was a good actress but she was not God's gift to earth, so stop with the worshipping. Unless you are a die heart Shearer fan, DO NOT buy this book, you will be disappointed. 
 An official Library Weekly book review.  EXCERPT: If you are like most people, you are struggling, without much success, to get the yield back into your savings. The places to which you are turning are not producing much relief.  RATING:  2 of 5  REVIEW: The 16% Solution is supposed to be a guide on how to invest in tax liens; however, as you turn the pages, you find that it seems to cut back and forth with fictional characters and then law-based jargon. There is an attempt by the author to deliver a point, which is commendable, but there are many parts of the book that needs editing.  While this is an acceptable guide to investing in tax lien certificates, it would not be a first pick.  OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.

 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.  Rennie Petersen  PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul) 
 This was a disappointment obviously generated to cash in on Franken's previous blockbuster on Fat Idiot and Notorious Bush Water Carrier Limbaugh. I struggled through about thirty pages before I started feeling scammed. Then again, the title hints at why this book is so spare and uninteresting 
 This "book" is 30 pages of general information about Hashimoto's, and a couple of vague pages on diet, all of which is easily available on the web. The poor writing, lack of content, and the 80 pages of worksheets in the back of the "book" were disappointing. This information should be published as a pamphlet, not a book. Don't waste your money here, just Google "hashimotos. 
 This is a very angrily written book.  It is hard to take it too seriously even when there are some segments of truth.  Author has an axe to grind 
 This book is, quite simply, not much of anything. The story-telling is flat and uninteresting.  The plot was predictable, the characters one-dimensional. I thought about considering it as a book for young readers, but "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" it isn't. Entirely forgettable.  Not destined to be a classic 
 A this book is a horrendous confusion of second hand opinion on reading rate.  As with good learning ability, the more strategies and accurate knowledge you have about reading, the better you will become.  However, this book twists pseudoscience and misleads the reader at almost every turn.  The term reading, involves at least 5 seperate rates which have different goals (Memorising, learning, Rauding(normal reading rate for good comprehension), skimming, and scanning).  The author uses only the word "reading" to account for all of them.  He claims that you can read at a breakneck speed with full comprehension.  However, even an inexperienced reader would class that as skimming, and reasonably expect a severely reduced comprehension level.  Reading research (and common sense) will back this up.  Skimming is useful at sometimes, when comprehension is not important.  However, the author seems to be encouraging the blanket application of skimming, thereby training possibly the worst kind of reading habit possible:  Single track ignorance.  The exercises and tests given are not reading comprehension tests.  They are a combibation of skimming and general knowledge tests.  A very cheap confidence trick.  Find a good book on reading skills, and some good books you like reading. Victo 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 My 3-year-old loves this book, so I bought him a new copy to replace his tattered old one. I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch. I bought him another version that had other little blue engine stories, and it was a big hit. 
 I bought this unit a few years back.  Worthless at best!  I wish someone - even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units.  I called their customer service - who said, "Good Luck" as their best solution.  The problem is - Aluminum cools off too fast.  It will NOT retain heat.  I wish I could locate a Cast Iron Krumkake!  Do they make them anymore?  eBay - HELP!! 
 I feel that Day Tader II is really a rip-off as it basically just reguritates most of the material found in volume one. THIS is typical Bernstein -- the goal is dollars from book sales, not educating the reader. Mr. Bernstein does not respect his readers, and this is the sad part because he obviously is a highly intelligent man who probably could contribute a lot to the field of daytrading education if he weren't so needy and greedy. I wouldn't go so far as to call him "Jake the Snake", but I do think he should put more care into the content of his books 
 This piece of politically correct rubbish is what kept Martin Scorsese from having Goodfellas honored with a Best Picture Oscar?  Unbelieveable 
 Myself, my peers, and my teaching assistant for my math class equally agree that this book isn't that great.  Topics have few examples, if none at all, and can be hard to follow. It only has one color ink, black; and with all the text so close together with nearly the same font and size it's hard to find key equations from previous chapters.  This may be the best book out there for advanced calculus, but it desperately needs to be revised and reorganized 
 This hybrid of hip-hop Tarantino and Hong Kong action films is for the most part a pathetic exercise.  Director Che Kirk-Wong has a decent knack for staging action sequences but can't overcome the script's lame comedy.  Mark Wahlberg's performance is a definite high point because he manages to escape this film dignity intact.  Low point is Elliott Gould(How the mighty have fallen.  You're not in "M*A*S*H*" anymore, Elliott.) throwing up on Lou Diamond Phillips.  Christina Applegate plays Wahlberg's Jewish American Princess fiancee(!).  The casting agents couldn't find authentic ethnic types for the role?  Oh well, their better off for it 
 This book was NOT FUNNY.  Anybody who compares it to Woody Allen is hurting Woody!  He wrote about his imagined friendship with President Kennedy; not funny.  The Hansen's Christmas letter each year was not funny.  Even the discussion of Martha Stewart's vagina was not funny.  The book looked like it was trying too hard and totally missed the mark. The title could have been really funny and wasn't.  I bought it in the aiport and had a long plane ride and was really psyched to read it.  The book was lousy from beginning to end and I don't even recall anything funny in the entire book.  Don't waste your money.  See the show, but don't bother with such a lame book. I would have given it NO STARS, but the system wouldn't let me 
 I love the Walk Away the Pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite.  It's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me 
 This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on "Surrender" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex.  "I Like" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose 
 This is one of the worst children's games I ever played.  There are caterpillars to move around, but they don't really go anywhere, and it's so simple that even my 3 year old is completely bored with it.  Buy any other game but this one 
 After having seen this movie, I understand why Europeans, Arabs and everybody else hates Americans... There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.  The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.  Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building. Everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself.  It's a miracle to us, how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining - the movie is bad, pretending it to be a satyre doesn't make it any better 
 I usually consider myself pretty accepting of different vocal styles, and since I'm a massive fan of death metal I have grown accustomed to moronic and uninspired lyrics...but this is too much even for me.  I bought this album after hearing the song "Cleansation," which I thought was very good.  The rest of the songs fell flat.  I tried listening to this album multiple times since I had heard SO much praise of it, but it was a chore to sit through.  When I hear the vocalist screaming "I...HATE.....EVERYONE!" repeatedly, it just doesn't get much dumber.  It's clearly a ploy to try to win over some of those pre-teen boys rebelling against their parents, by tapping into that pseudo-angst that you hear so much in bands like Slipknot.  Frankly I cannot stomach music that is clearly marketed towards 13 year olds, as it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone past that age...or to 13 year olds who are able to sense maturity in music and lyrics.  Beyond that, the vocals themselves would be much more suited for a nu-metal band.  The music itself here is decent, especially considering the atrocious roadrunner roster that we have to compare it to.  However, overall the songwriting is not memorable, and the vocals just ruin the entire sound.  This is basically a watered down version of extreme metal.  While it may be very useful for getting some slipknot fans listening to some better stuff (what i think of as extreme metal "training wheels"), if you are already into the scene you are better off looking right past this release.    Sorry to slam this, but I was told REPEATEDLY that this was the album of 2004...and I've never been more disgusted.  
 Very disappointed with this last release looks like Tiesto has lost his touch. Only 3 good songs, the rest are ok nothing really stands out. Get them on itunes instead I was really looking to this release I have listened to it at least 30 times hoping it will grow on me and it does not. Tiesto if you are reading this please go back to your old style it was magical this CD is not please stay a legend 
 I got this on an Amazon special for $34.79. For the money the features seemed very competitive. The product description says "fits 9 to 13 inch arms" My arm measures exactly 13 inches. There is a "OK" mark on arm cuff which states "Index must be in Ok range". My 13 inch arm falls 2 1/4 inches into the "Select Larger Cuff" range. In all fairness, if you mail in your register receipt and the UPC code off the box, Samsung does include a coupon for a "Free" larger cuff for $11.95 (USA ) $21.95 (Overseas) shipping and 4 to 6 weeks delivery.

 I would have to agree with both the positive AND negative comments about this version of Mozart's Die Zauberflote. All the technical and production comments are accurate enough,but also,(and more importantly),1)This opera is written in German and I'm a big believer in performing great operatic works not only in their entirety,but also in their original language, 2)AND most importantly for myself,the opera is intended to be a comedy;yes,but a BLACK COMEDY! This production turns it into a FARCE,(which is why children probably love it so much).If the kiddies saw this opera as intended,(regardless of choice of language),they would probably go running and screaming to dive under their beds and shake! The evil Queen really IS EVIL! More like in Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' than say, Jareth in 'The Labyrinth',(as a reference only). I think one is able to get a little more comfortable with Bergman's Queen than Mozart intended. 'Nough said 
 I heard stories about Michelle Branch before trying out her music. And i was electrified to find out that there is still a young, honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up. First off all, i'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners' opinion, so yup...criticism is welcomed. I'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too. Basically, my main influences are Bon Jovi, the Goo Goo Dolls and ELO. I'm a 17-year-old male.  Hotel Paper is one big step for michelle. She evidentally matured  her music between "Spirit Room" and this. Michelle is pretty much at the state where she can't really make big steps on her own. And that's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream. Like the fact that she wrote so many catchy, boring and good-to-sell singles that won't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side. Although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she CAN write decent music.(Tuesday Morning, Drop in the Ocean, Hotel Paper)  Some peeps are saying how Michelle isn't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist. I agree. IMO, many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal. Even a noob guitarist like me could tell. But afterall, it's pop, so that's inevitable. But she could do MUCH MUCH better than that. Her lyrics are ok since she doesn't write no emo nor punk junk, but a lot of complaining and childish relationships. Most are ok though.  What i'm saying is, she most definetly has her own style...but sadly, it's surpressed at an extent where it's irritating and  makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on Michelle's music. Nevertheless, just because Michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the "guitar", doesn't mean you gotta try her music out. But sadly, that's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted. I believe it's more about how you like the music.  I can't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future. But to me, it seems like she's throwing those away for popularity. One good example is, as prolly you've already heard...the posing for a men's magazine named M----. Whatever she was thinking, it really crushed my impressions on michelle...the cute musical lady she used to be....And the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend.  Michelle IS talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists, but let's get real here...she has a long way to go. She most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i'll be listening to her matured and true music. Afterall, IMO, it's only the matter of time before she surpasses Amanda Marshall on my list.  I really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to.  "Tuesday Morning" 3.5/5 "Hotel Paper" 4/5 The rest are just mediocre 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It's very hard to clean.  It's loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you 
 I was not impressed with this book at all. The book jumps around WAY too much and going on just the original band members interviews for his information, rather than doing other research and interviewing other people that were in the band and close to the band, the book comes off as more of a homage to Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath lineup. The book spends WAY too long talking about the orginial lineup (which is about 3/4 of the book) and downplaying (and trashing) the history of the band after Osbourne had left. The is none more evident in the chapter entitled "Changing Horses in the Middle Of a Dream" where Rosen tries to explain the split with Ozzy (which he doesn't explain really at all) and the hiring of Ronnie James Dio, which he rips apart and blasts at every given chance. The constant Dio bashing too, which starts from sentence one after the mention of his name, got old very quickly and Rosen's constant references to how Black Sabbath sounded like with him (like Dio's previous bands Elf and Rainbow) is just plain insulting to those who are also fans of the post-Ozzy Black Sabbath eras. I had to go back to the cover of the book a few times while reading that chapter to see if the book had, in fact, been written by Sharon Osbourne, since the venom in his words sounds a lot like something that she would say.  Rosen offers WAY too many opinions and not enough facts. His ommitting almost the entire post-Geezer Butler/Bill Ward eras almost misleads the reader to thinking that there was no Black Sabbath past the Ozzy and Dio eras, which I have found actually more interesting to read about than the days with Ozzy. The time that Ian Gillan was in the band was barely skirted over and some other important people involved with the band (post-Ozzy) were hardly mentioned at all. Also, almost relying completely on Bill Ward for information during the the period when Ozzy left the band and when Dio joined was not the best thing to do, since Ward spent most of that time in a substance-abused fog and his memory is not the best about that period (he even admits not remembering recording 99% of "Heaven And Hell").  With the foreward also written by Ozzy Osbourne, it also leads me to believe that the Osbourne camp had some say in the content of the book, or that Rosen is simply just a over-sensitive Ozzy Osbourne fan and needs to defend him at every given chance. This book comes off like a fans' guide to the band and not an actual biography. Rosen comes off as being the biggest Ozzy-led Black Sabbath fan on the face of the planet and just too biased to them. Not worth the money, if you are planning on buying it, but worth a look, if you by, some chance, find it in a local libary somewhere. Skip it, if you plan on buying it, though. BTW... there are MANY better books on Black Sabbath than this!!!! This narrow-minded homage is almost insulting 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 How he gets away with it I will never understand.Orson Welles was a Clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms.(that's what you do when you can't make art)Don't worry,there is always Rossellini,Fellini,Renoir,Bergman,Dreyer... ... 
 Shark Attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage.  The movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver.  The most interesting part is all the shark footage...  The best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten, the shark clearly shown with a hook in it's mouth being pulled towards a boat.  This of course has nothing at all to do with the plot.  So where did this hook come from?  It was probably I was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie 
 This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a  chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the  director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so  terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that  such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only  hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes 
 Though it is an upper-level undergraduate physics text/low-level graduate physics text, it's readability and usability would be greatly improved were the author to keep consistent notation.  I don't really understand how a quantum mechanics book that can pass for a graduate level text doesn't have a Clebsch-Gordan table in it, but overall it's pretty user-friendly otherwise 
 The concept of the title sounded great since, like most golfers, I tend to think too much. But actually the book gives you very little more than it's title. Basically, it's message is "forget about it' AND GO SEE A PGA PRO. There is really no substance here 
 My primary complaint with this book was its predictability.  Less than halfway through, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I wasn't wrong.  So it was just a matter of slogging through the rest to get to the end.  I also wasn't overly amused by most of the so-called witticisms and amusing one-liners of several characters.  It wasn't endearing, only annoying.    All in all, pretty disappointing 
 Someone else picked SOW for class because they used it in homeschooling.  If you don't know, or don't care, about history, and want to breeze from one snippet to another, this may be for you.  Otherwise, think about other choices.  Without maps or pictures, this book is like a self-published typescript, truly "dumbed down."      Looking through the juvenile sections of the library I find so many up to date history books, with maps, pictures, material from original sources, and well written text (without the "!" gaa-gaa style of SOW).  The time could be better spent.    I am not a fan of textbooks.  The current ones are beautiful and have all the CDs, tests, and everything with them, but they are very expensive and grow tiresome, flogging the same format and style throughout, without the passion or enthusiasm authors of topic books bring.    If you are a home schooler, go to the library.  Do a survey, make up a list and a timeline.  Then begin.  If you are in a school, and have a teacher who likes (or even doesn't loathe) history, please don't make them waste time with this.      I do, by the way, have a classical education, not Christian, but classical, with all those dead white guys, languages, and museums, even travel.  SOW does make some attempt to balance American dn European with material from other countries, but it never ties together.  There is no "encounter" or sense of how this fits together, of the sameness and difference.  It's just sort of "told."    Although I'm weaker in non-Western stuff, I did that as well, and read my share of Japanese, Indian, Chinese, and middle eastern history, philosophy, and literature.  Have a go at it.  Trust yourself and the kids to think.      
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 I was so disappointed with this book, and am surprised at the number of fabulous reviews it received.  Every page demanded that I revel in my "feminist roots."  For any would-be stay at home moms interested in supporting their husbands by keeping house, fixing dinner, and doing laundry in addition to taking care of the kids--this is not the book for you.  It encourages you to not "give in" to the stereotypes and does not acknowledge that there may in fact be jobs just for dads and jobs just for moms.  I know this is not a popular view, maybe I'm the only one around who thinks this.  Your husband, however, may not be overjoyed if you take this book to heart!!!  Also, for any mothers seeking a more spiritual path to staying at home, this book advocated TOTAL CONTROL by you in your decisions--really letting your own self-interests direct your routine instead of those around you or giving up those self-interests in pursuit of a higher calling.  Even though I consider myself to be a feminist in many ways, this book was TOO MUCH 
 If you want information on how/when to use reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, etc), and when not to use them, this book won't help you whatsoever. It explains what reflexive pronouns are, but says nothing about usage 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 Cute but, at bedtime, the slightest movement sets it off, waking up baby. As a result, it's going in the pool next time around 
 This is the worst romance I have read in ages and ages. The heroine is perfect- like Jo in Little Women. She can do all and be all. Independent, head-strong, beautiful ofcourse. And the guy she picks- tall, handsome, loyal, perfectly patient with all of Elizabeth's ("don't call me Bessie!") prickliness. "don't call me Bessie" is what she constantly says to all the family members- quite repetitive. And that is another reason this book is really poor. So much repetition. In the first few chapters the author says the same things over and over and over again- How the Uncle took the first two daughters to court to find their husbands. How Elizabeth doesn't really want to go. They say it to each other, they say it again.  Spare yourself. And if you must read it, get it from the library. This is not a book you'll want to pay for or keep or lend to a friend. Want a good historical romance? Try The Queen's Fool by Phillipa Gregory. Now that is a complicated plot with lots of surprises. And the heroine isn't quite perfect.. 
 I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight.  Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books.  He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for?  Do I care if things go well?  The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself.  I miss the old spark. 
 As someone who has been in Eckankar even longer than Mr.Johnson was,I can attest to how many of the 'facts' he changed,left out or plain misrepresented in his righteous quest for the 'truth'.I was around during many of the events he describes,and whatever doesn't fit his agenda,(i.e.makes Eckankar look bad),he simply leaves out.This is not a book of serious research,but a polemic written by someone who was angry at being disciplined by his teacher,and interested only in gathering his own following,with HIM as the teacher 
 I bought this book for the Amazon.com web services section.  While the information she provided was interesting, it was out of date.  She talks about the Amazon.com Product ID and Amazon now uses an Access Id and Secret Access Id.  Didn't look at the other Google, eBay, PayPal, etc. service 
 **SPOILERS** Fortunately, I only paid about fifty cents for this book.  The writer begins by bashing the original by Leroux, but then does no better with his own book.  It is filled with poorly fleshed-out charachters and plots, and contains an unbearable amount of unbelievable and ridiculous scenes and coincidences.  I want to know more about the night Pierre was conceived.  I think it's just a little "too swell" that Raoul became impotent early in life.  And come on, I mean, what a terrible ending...Raoul (who can't speak/understand English very well) suddenly speaks to his son in English during a very tender, intimate moment?  And then, Pierre, who has grown up with Raoul for 12 years, just up and leaves him for Erik (his biological father)?  If I found out after all these years that my own dad was not my biological parent, I'd pretty hard-pressed to just decide to stay in a foreign country with my sudden "real" dad.  C'mon Mr. Forsyth.  Give us readers some credit.  Personally, I'd like to read a version where Erik DOES find love, but with someone other than Christine.  Maybe I'll write it myself:)  Read if you must folks, but beware.    
 Given the rave reviews for this book, I was surprised by the lack of content and value. The book's message is a truism: only you are responsible for your own happiness. It goes on to encourage you to ask for what you want. These aren't bad assertions but they're more complicated to implement than this book would have you believe. The content is structured like an article in a woman's magazine: it uses a bulletized format with basic questions to ask yourself like "What do you enjoy" followed by inane suggestions like "Decorate your office". Cloying and without substance, this book fails to answer many core questions. What if your boss declines your request? What motivates an organization? How do you make lateral moves? Where are the examples of individuals who reengineered their work situation and how exactly they did it ? Granted, too many employees don't understand the work relationship or how to work an organization. But this is not the book that will address those issues. If you're still determined to read this book, my copy is up for sale on Amazon's used site 
 I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner. 
 I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.   I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.    I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.       
 Its all fine to give players every option ever thought of to create characters but it makes no sense in not balancing the game for playability when it comes to being a gamemaster.  Like a good producer/director/screenwrite all n one, the gamemaster must create a world , an adventure, all the villains, npcs and monsters and make the game fun for the players.  In order to do that the GM must know all the rules and be up on ever character type put in front of him.  that's not to say it is impossible just very tedious for the gamemaster who must make the game enjoyable for ALL the players.  There are many more problems, Bad presentation...the background noise and artwork are not that good on the eyes so those of us that have to get out magnifying glasses to try and read the gm guide an player's handbook will have a harder time of it.  IN any event, I think it is poorer quality than ALL the previous versions of the game.  I have gm'd for 17 years and I am truly disappointed 
 I previously wrote a pretty harsh review of this book after purchasing it last year. In recent times my opinion of it has changed. The book captures TONS of good thoughts , and has excellent still photos. Its very useful, once you get past the fact that there are no video samples included with the book. I would dare to say that if it were to include such video clips on DVD or multimedia CD, it would become an EXCELLENT learning/reference tool for young directors (etc) searching to master their artform.   If only i could edit this review to say 4 1/2 stars!  < please see my old review below>  'Coffee Table Book - More form than function'  Maybe i am being harsh, but the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its readers. Its the prettiest book in the box of ten that i bought last week on Amazon, but its content is suited either for the person with just a passing interest in music videos (like a sunday afternoon coffee guest - "Will she glance at the cosmopolitan or read the Music Video book?" or someone else who has lots time and no specific interest in music videos).   I hardly feel like i am IN the 'minds' of these directors, truly learning from the way they THINK, or other aspects of thier creative story. The book is more like a compilation of 'behind the scenes' glances on 'E' or VH1.   Perhaps including a CD inside the book, with medium resolution copies of all the videos would help a bit. The visual reference would turn each conversation with the directors into a tangible learning experience that anyone with a PC could relate to.   The worst part for me is that most of these videos are of a genre that i dont listen to. I am primarily R&B, Hip-hop, Reggae (Dancehall) by blood and by love. The only people in this book who i listen to are Lauryn Hill and Seal.  I am really disappointed by this book.   Like i said, the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its Audience. I am left to wonder who was the target audience?  <old review ends here> 
 We bought this because the same series had extremely thorough, excellent "The Everything Bible Book" written by a Catholic priest. This "everything" Catholic book is lacking in detail and accuracy and omits Adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. For religious vocations  the authors never mention that today's growing religious orders (priest, sisters,nuns, brothers and consecrated) receiving a multitude of novices are the traditional faithful. There is one mention of World Youth Day which is a 2 decades phenomena, not just an entry for the year 2002 "in Toronto to raise interest in vocations". Under the topic "The call to holiness" is the heading 'the priesthood' which ignores constant church teaching that each person is called to holiness regardless of his or her vocation in life. There's one "E" alert to the effect that many Catholic lay people complain that they are not heard by the upper levels of the church. The fact that Rev. Curran is made an "E" alert under "Catholic Universities" for publicly protesting the Church's unwavering teaching on contraception (which all Christians held to until 1930 with the Anglican Lamberth decision) shows the reader that the authors prefer to highlight heretics rather than actual Catholic doctrine and faith. Can't recall seeing the word 'faith' more than once, nor Blessed Sacrament. Scripture references are rare (maybe 3) and zero references to the current Catechism of the Catholic Church, although a brief mention is made that there exist throughout history 'catechisms'. Regarding women's ordination you will be informed that the topic today is "hotly debated" and many women have been better trained than priests. These examples show that opinions offset details and facts in this book although many details are provided with simple accuracy. There are several errors, unrelated to the fact that both authors are Canadian, such as: "The genuflection is made toward the 'monstrance' which holds the communion bread and wine", a way of honoring Christ's presence in the church. Correction: a monstrance is centrally located on the altar in the church  during Adoration and Benediction and neither devotion is mentioned in this book. What the authors meant was 'Tabernacle' and no explanation is given to which much should have to explain the significance linking the Old Testament holy of holies, manna,the priest Melkezidech and his sacrifice of bread and wine, and the Passover with Christ's New Covenant, Holy Eucharist and Tabernacle. The Catechism of the Catholic Church and "Why do Catholics do That" would be much better books for the topic of all things Catholic. 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 There is a single idea that permeates Koons work. This idea is neither good, nor original, nor indeed - since it has been 70 years since Duchamps "Fountain" - particularly exciting. If there were a "Ladybird book of Modern Art", Jeff's saccharine,  'easyfun' work would be that book.  Koons art-as-commodity schitck would be more convincing if the buying public had to decide. His commodities fail  as commodities - their status as art, is, of course guaranteed, since (see Duchamp) he has told us it is so.  Show me one more Scots Terrier made of flowers and I shall reach for my Uzi in a frenzy of post-modern criticis 
 I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book.  The characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny, droning music.  
 I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest this book to anyone 
 I ordered the Saturday Morning Special gift set and tried the Tui Herbal Shampoo right away.  As with everyone else, no lather and lots of tangles.  After the second wash, I decided to use my Pantene Relaxed and Natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair.  This stuff is a rip off.  On the plus side, it works fabulously on my children's hair. They are bi-racial and have naturally curly hair.  I don't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair.  It just doesn't work 
 I'm disappointed to say this book is just one long 117-page sales letter.  Matt Bacak is a well-known promoter and marketer and this book contains basic snippets of information without really revealing much content. Lots of web site addresses and links to go check out but many of those just promote products. The information that is exposed is pretty old-hat in the Internet arena now, such as "squeeze pages" - there I've just revealed the main "amazing new" concept of the book.  I'd be less harsh on the merits of the book if it was free, but as Matt is taking your hard-earned money then the book needs to be judged more critically.   If you're a real newbie that doesn't know the basics of traffic or lead generation then the book will provide basic concepts. But to its claim to being an "Ultimate Lead Generation Plan" - well that's just marketing hype 
 Total waste of money. Once plugged in it locks up the computer. Got in touch with Seagate, and apart from an e-mail welcoming me to the Seagate "team", I've heard nothing since. TigerDirect, with which I've had good success up to now, will not accept a return - must go through Seagate, so be careful if you buy from Tiger 
 Well.... I was really excited when I found out that 'the official learn-the-dance moves DVD from the creators of the hit film YOU GOT SERVED!' was being release. I didn't particularly enjoy the movie as the acting was terrible and there wasn't much of a storyline...but the dances moves were BANGING! But to be honest when I bought the take it to the streets DVD...I was disappointed. The moves didn't turn out to be so `hot' and me being a quick learner I thought that the routines were too rushed. Out of the whole 54 minutes, the only thing I did enjoy, was watching Omari Grandberry's freestyle (which only lasted about 3 minutes) 
 First, the thesis of The God Code is an intriguing one. I applaud new and creative ideas that attempt to meld science and spirituality. Nonetheless, some aspects of the book I found a bit difficult to get down with. Some of these one could reasonably expect an editor or proofreaders to catch, as accidental typos and incorrect transcriptions do happen. There are several in this text. Without tiring you with a list, let me give one example: on page 16, Braden states Pioneer 10 is almost 11 light years away, and then he writes it took 11 hours to send a signal to it from Earth. Nothing humans are apt to use travels faster than the speed of light, so the existence of any signal that could reduce the amount of time it takes light to travel in one year to the space of only an hour is truly questionable.  At times Braden had to rely on other experts in telling his story. The feedback he received on evolution certainly was not as precise as it could have been. First, even though he treats creationism and evolution as competing theories, it must be noted that a scientific theory is not the same as the way "theory" is used in the vernacular. So although one can refer to creationism "theory" in conversation, to put it in the same sentence with evolutionary theory may mislead some readers who do not beforehand understand the difference between scientific theory and a conjecture. Generally, scientific theory is not only testable, but has more or less passed every test to which it has been subjected. That it may need modification from time to time-or be incomplete-does not place it in the same category as belief or faith or hypothesis or revelation.  Speaking of evolution, yes, the evidence does appear to support it. Braden's questioning of evolutionary premises seems based on a few assumptions that are not even in the theory. For instance, new forms of life do not "descend" from others per se as he suggests the theory claims. Evolution does not proceed in a line, but is rather a motley series of disparate forms resulting from what appears to be almost random motion away from simple beginnings toward forms where more complexity may or may not be present. Increasing complexity is an incidental consequence of natural selection. After all, bacteria still dominate on almost every level. Life appears to seek ways to reproduce itself, period. Sometimes more complex life forms do develop from other life forms (as they secure new niches in which to prosper), but more complexity is not always advantageous.  Another point: even though Braden appears to suggest otherwise, species can and do co-exist, even if one apparently provided the basis for another. There is a huge number of such examples in nature. Further, there is no reason to assume humans should have evolved other species by now simply because our genotype has been around for 160,000 to 200,000 years. Plenty of species have been around essentially unchanged for millions of years, and this is not a problem for the theory of natural selection (for to be more precise, evolution is the fact and natural selection is the corresponding theory).  I found his analysis of the "God code" itself interesting, but not compelling. I do not say that to be disparaging, because I know that the advancement of human knowledge often begins in flights of fancy. However, as Braden takes his logical leaps, some things stand out. Let's just accept for a moment that his conversion of "atomic mass" to what he calls "simple mass" is a logical progression. Given that (and that is a stretch), the atomic mass of oxygen is 15.99, which converts to 16, not 15 as he states. That gives us Z, not V (in the charts he provides). This may not invalidate his argument, depending on the meaning and history of Z, but he doesn't even address Z.  Furthermore, I believe Figure 6.5 needs further development or explication. As it is, it adds nothing to the discussion. I would have found an analysis of the chart in Appendix C much more enlightening (e.g., how the number of atoms in each DNA base relate to the numbers in the God code). Perhaps that is a subject for future writing?  A couple more nit-picks. Throughout the text, he often uses "while" when he actually means "although." I realize new uses for words become more acceptable in writing as people insist continue to use words incorrectly in conversation and informal prose. My favorite example not in this book (and mind you I understand it is simply an example of how language develops and changes) is the ubiquitous current use of "impact" as a verb. For all I know, "while" can now correctly be used in place of "although," but my publication manual still draws a distinction. The other irritant is the man uses way more exclamation points in this book than any school girl would. 
 I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....    2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player 
 This may be the most disorganized book I have ever read, and it contains numerous factual errors to boot, a kiss of death for a supposed history book.  The vignettes come at you with no apparent thought about how one  inter-relates with another.  It is just a jumbled mess of repetitious  incidents randomly presented.  A simple solution would have been to build  each chapter around a port of emigration.  As for factual errors, how about  the Titanic sailing on its maiden voyage from New York City.  Or, on one  page you are told a ship sank but most of its 200 passengers survived.  On  the next page you are told that most died.  And there is no further  explanation or clarification given.  Dates of events are given as one year  in the book, and pages later as another year.  The book is published by  reputable Henry Holt.  Boy, they were totally asleep on this one.  Even if  there are some interesting facts given, how can you trust them in the face  of all the errors.  If you like watching movies to find the mistakes - like  Plan 9 From Outer Space -- then this book is for you.  All other  potential readers, beware 
 Read: "The Austrian-Jewish Mind". 95% of the men reviewed in this volume were Jews. Austria in the early 20th boils down to three strands of history: the fall of the Dual Monarchy, the Jews of Vienna -- and Austrians. You will not find anything about real Austrians in this book. 
 Chose this guidebook over others as much to check out the Frommer's style as to get travel info. Normally I am a Lonely Planet guy, but since I was staying with friends didn't need a lot of in depth descriptions of logistics (lodging, travel etc.). Just looking for a description of some of the attractions.  I found the guide difficult to use. Although I didn't need much in the way of logistical support, there was really very little. There were only about 4 maps in the whole book and they were spaced out all over the place. Virtually no information on specifics for those arriving overland. Worse, the descriptions of the attractions any sense of enthusiasm. Normally when I read a guidebook, I get the sense that sites are over-hyped, but this book almost made me want to skip the city altogether.   I have found Frommers on-line a good source of info and reviews but won't be buying another of their guidebooks in the future 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 Like many conspiracy books, the impact of Garrison's tome depends on the reader having little independent knowledge of the facts of the case.  In this case:  1. Garrison conceals problems with witness testimony.   2. Garrison recounts the testimony of witnesses who were discredited before the Shaw case came to trial, and who were never called to testify precisely because they lacked credibility. He apparently assumes (correctly, in many cases) that readers will not know that these witnesses were discredited.   3. Garrison takes witnesses who appeared rather late in the investigation and has them appear earlier so as to imply a sound basis for his suspicions about David Ferrie, arrest of Clay Shaw, etc.   4. Garrison makes excuses for the failure of his case, claiming sabotage by nefarious Federal authorities, journalists, and governors of states who supposedly refused to extradite witnesses he wanted. He would have had a case, he implies, if sinister forces had not impeded his prosecution.   5. Garrison inflates his own (and his staff's) investigative prowess. Ideas that were the result of crackpot inferences (Shaw as "Bertrand"), or dropped into Garrison's lap by buffs trying to help become the product of painstaking investigation.   6. Garrison conceals his own volatile character, painting himself as a model of self control.   7. Garrison paints a vivid picture of himself in the courtroom during the testimony of Clay Shaw and Charles Spiesel, and when the verdict was read, in spite of the fact that he was absent. Had he told the truth, readers would wonder why he was absent from the most important case he had ever brought.   People who want to believe Garrison doubtless will, but people who are at least a bit skeptical should check the following web page:  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/jimlie.ht 
 The book is poorly written, a umble of unformulated thoughts and half-developped ideas. The author also appears to be biased- not a good point if you want to discover something on your own, without your perception being warped - as the author's apparently was - by a one-sided view 
 If you are trying to learn the solos of the first four Iron Maiden albums (S/T, Killers, Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind), this is not the book for you. This book only has the rhythm guitar. 
 Only about 1/3 of this book is about pirate queens.  The other 2/3 is the author being absorbed with herself.  Why she thinks that her Outward Bound experiences or her opinions about German tourists are of interest to anybody but herself is beyond me.  This is a pity because when she does write about pirate queens it is clear she has done her homework and she tells a good story. Skip this book unless you want to learn how to write history like a Californian 
 this is basically a walkthrough but they dont tell you that i was dissapointed when i finally get it, but thats just me its up tu yo 
 Only my second book by this author and I don't remember the first one.  I am wondering how dumb she thinks her readers are that she has to repeat the same facts over and over and over.  For instance that our hero and heroine were once almost lovers, except she couldn't, but they never got over each other.    That she dresses like an old maid and he is soooo attractive he turns all the girls heads.   He wears an off-white stetson he tips over his piercing gray eyes and he has a hair roughened chest.  I agree with other readers that who done it was not at all hard to guess and I've only read the first 160 pages.  Does anyone ever heed the warning given by other readers to skip this one?    I didn't think so 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 I will agree that this is good source of overall view of the certain aspects of art history--the western side. It's always been quite an amusement for me to see books claiming to be  a History of Art book and only include the WESTERN History of Art. It seems these historians have forgotten just how influential EASTERN art has been in forming these WESTERN artists. The Jansons book is no exception. Quite disappointment, and I wouldn't have had much to complain, if they hadn't started the book with a grand "What is Art?", intending to quite obviously to include all arts.. oops, forgot to do your homework there Jansons 
 This item was advertised as being similar to Matisyahu.  It was an embarrassment to listen to it. 
 Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.  As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly. I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste. As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.  Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..  It is absolutely infuriating 
 Overall, it's disappointing. The book merely scratches the surface on a wide range of topics and therefore is only slightly useful for someone who already knows what processes are or can build a kernel. Still haven't found a replacement for O'reilly's Understanding the Linux Kernel, which has detailed coverage of such topics as processes, scheduling, and memory management. 
 I am a Howard Stern fanatic and a softball fanantic. I couldn't go wrong with this movie, right? Wrong! It is pretty bad. I was disappointed with Artie's project. Gross jokes terrible acting. There are a couple of funny scenes. Wait until it is on sale 
 I bought this book for my son who has never had a lesson but has been self teaching himself for a few years. The things I was disappointed about 1) the singing is so HORRIBLE it is almost impossible to watch.  My son became frustrated with this alone and never wanted to continue...His exact words, "This is LAME."  He wouldn't use it, so I decided to try to learn guitar to keep from wasting my money.  2) The descriptions on the cover are misleading and lead you to believe there is much more advanced instruction than is actually in it...there is little about much of it and then it is not what the instructor leads you to believe it is...for example the jazz chords are not actually what you expect to learn.  3) The instructor uses different fingering techniques than he instructs you to use, so learning it is very hard...part of the advantage of buying a dvd is WATCHING the instructor...which is totally useless if he is doing something different than he instructs you to do.  Also it is hard to keep up with him as his fingering techniques allow him to change chords much more quickly and you are struggling to keep up.  Being frustrated when you are trying to learn is NOT a good way to stay motivated.  My son had to tell me it wasn't me it was the instructor. 4) my son knew ALL of the material in this DVD although he has never had a lesson.  I would recommend this for a very early beginner who had no clue about chords or guitars at all.  Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I did learn a little. I am a complete idiot about guitars but knew a good bit of what was presented just from guitars being in my home.  This is the most elementary information you can imagine 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 Sometimes mentioned as one of the "banned books of the bible", the Book of Jubilees covers the same ground as Genesis and part of Exodus. It's one of the books of the Pseudepigrapha, which means "writings with false superscription", according to the introduction. I found it boring and difficult to read. It shares a similarity with the Oahspe bible in one instance, where Abraham is instructed to kill Isaac by an evil spirit ("prince of the Mastema"), and he doesn't because he realises that it's a spirit and not God communicating with him. It includes fragments of old texts such as the Book of Noah and there's more reference to Enoch than in Genesis.  Overall, I would recommend it only to obsessive or completist students/scholars of the Old Testament 
 This would have been a great book if they had made it into a larger format and made the text legible! The type is so small it's nearly impossible to read. I'm returning it because it's useless to me as-is. 
 What a disappointment!  It sure looks like there's a good mystery in this book somewhere but digging through all the detail and ploding style is just too much.  A great read if you're looking to become an insurance claims adjuster 
 I loved this book. Having read the first two this one mixed in familiar characters just enough to make you feel like you are seeing another part of the community.  The characters were very real to life and shows that misunderstandings happen between people.  The storyline about the husband's family was very interesting and well told. It made me want to visit the area.  All in all - you have a love story, a mystery, and a story of community.  Terrific 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I think there may be a hint of jealousy in this book.  I've often thought of Zizek as the kind of guy who strives to be the rock star of philosophy. Of course, more than ten years after his death, Deleuze is packing more philosophical arenas than Zizek ever will.  This is because, in my humble opinion, Zizek is and always will be a second rate philosopher.  He is the Douglas Coupland of academic philosophy in that, while he is often an interesting read, one always walks away from the book feeling like they've gained nothing but a few perverse ways of stating the obvious.  I will admit, Zizek has a flare for writing, notably, I think in the Ticklish Subject and Welcome to the Desert of the Real.  But this book not only failed to accomplish it's goals but it did so rather uninterestingly.  Somewhere around the end of the first third of the book he quotes Deleuze's famous passage about buggering other philosophers in the behind.  I've always loved the passage and til that point I thought the book was heating up so I had hopes of engaging in an eye-opening debate about Deleuze with both the text and my own preconceptions.  But what I got from that point on was a stream of endless, pretentious comparisions between what most people assume Hegel meant and what Zizek somehow interprets Deleuze to mean.    Basically, it seemed to me like Zizek's project was misguided in that it relied too heavily on a limited interpretation of Deleuze based on Zizek's slight admiration for the Logic of Sense and his disdain for Deleuze's work with Guattari.  Zizek almost comes off as a crying child who wanted ice cream when everyone else wanted cake and couldn't have his way.  He passes over without even the slightest mention the idea that perhaps A Thousand Plateau's truly is a revolutionary text (or radical series of texts - whatever).  He does this because he likes better the ideas he has developed out of the Logic of Sense.    In other words, Zizek is fatalistically attached to the offspring that emerged when Deleuze's logic of sense poked him in the butt.  The joke's on you, Slavoj 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 I am going to return this book and get my money back from the authors. Hey, they offer in writing in the book.   Your best source of what you want is from you. Your best source of information is from recent brides. Know what you want first and then figure out how to make it happen. New brides are more than happy to give advice and tips. Another plus is that new brides still remember how important it is for you to have your own individual wedding. New brides will give recommendations and let you talk out what you want, and then they will get the heck out of your way.   If you are recently engaged then you have probably already started to hear many people tell you how should do things, what they would have done, and their expectations of your big day - all with varying levels of intensity. This book is more of that.   If you really are short of available recent brides to talk to then go ahead and read the book. Keep a saltshaker handy because a few grains are required to digest their advice. These poor authors who are so unpopular with the wedding industry, woe is them. How much do you want to trust a book that so whole-heartedly promoted one gown store and bashed another when their pet store is filing bankruptcy?   Yes, it is true. This book's pet bridal gown store, Discount Bridal Service (DBS), is going out of business, filing bankruptcy, and leaving thousands of brides without dresses. Their least favorite store, David's Bridal, is still in business and still providing dresses to us brides. (Plus you can try on dresses that fit and bring your camera!)  PS - A true source of information are event coordinators of any type. I got great information from hotel Sales Managers and various churches. Even though I was just getting information about room blocks or just inquiring about the wedding ceremony the Sales Managers and church Wedding Coordinators/Alter Guilds had great advice and could give me five recommendations each for photographers, florists, and bakers. This gave me a great start on looking for those kind of vendors. 
 I have significant experience in the embedded world (programming in C and assembler) and now I need to learn the .NET architecture.  Hence my interest in Platt's book.  I suppose different people learn and convey information in different ways, and some will find Platt's approach helpful.  I did not.  Through most of the book I found myself scratching my head trying to figure out what he was getting at, and then disappointed at the end of the chapter that he hadn't really told me much useful information.  I found myself reminded of sitting in University listening to brilliant Professors who are enamored with the funky little quirks and details of some new concept, but are unable (or unwilling) to convey the basics of how it actually works.   Be warned that this book does not deal with .NET v2.0, and most of the code examples on his website will not convert to the new release.  That can be very frustrating.  If you are running the VS2005 beta, you may want to get a different book or hold off until the next version of this one.  On a minor note, I found myself rolling my eyes at the author's constant attempts at humor by referring to other groups of techies as "geeks".  I don't think he was trying to be insulting as much as funny, but still--it comes across as a little lame.  Once or twice is humorous.  Dozens gets simply annoying.   
 The book is nothing more than a large ego trip from one of the most vile man in politics. Limbaugh has recycled his on air rant and raves into text.  There is nothing new here.  How a failed top forty DJ becomes the mouth piece for the republican party speaks a lot about conservatives.  Treat yourself to Viagra instead.  
 Be careful because this book is in Spanish even if you may note this information only enlarging the picture or, as in my case, when you receive the book at your home. Hopefully that might not be too bad a problem due to the repetitive nature of the sayings of the Buddha and my mother language but I would give a word of warning to anyone with a different background 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 Recent players who are good get included, many great players from bygone eras get totally neglected 
 Imagine a textbook without a glossary of terms. A book thatseems to use fancy nomenclature only as a tool to boostthe authors egos. Having strained through this text only by shear interest in Remote, I would advise any academic to look towards the piles of other more appropriatly constructed textbooks concerned with remote. As to the publishers claim that it also concerns itself with GIS applications, yes, but in an obscure and unfriendly manner. Do not consider this book as a textbook choice. It only serves to discredit the  noble and forthright advances of a vital technology 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 this album i found in someone's cd case my friend found and he gave it to me. then i found this i popped it in and i wasn't surpised because it came out in the bad boy era 1998 and i wasn't really feelin this cd but the only songs that i really liked was Wise Guys For Life and Tommy's Theme from the belly soundtrack featuring LOX   
 I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you 
 I was way into the return of the living dead series when i rented this. I started off with number 2 (whcih people here seem to hate for some reason), then was blown away when I saw number 1. I rented number 3 with pretty high expectations. I was expecting a zombie holocaust type situation (even if it was only in one town) along with a descent amount of comedy.   It turns out its a love story. *spoiler* the main character accidently kills his girlfriend in a motorcycle accident. guilt stricken he brings her back with the chemical from previous return films he gets out of his daddys lab. When his gf is brought back she struggles between the urge to eat brains and her love for the main character*/spoiler*. Its an interesting take on the zombie genre, with some good gore.   Its huge flaws are that it never seems to end when it should (it would have gotten another start for being shorter) and for trying to be too serious. The whole 'my daddys a military guy who has a secret lab' thing is done pretty cheesily, along with a lot of other things, yet it tries so hard to be serious. I seriously wasnt expecting that from a 'return' film, I expected my 'return' films to be fun and gruesome. Deffinently rent it tho, if for no other reason than to see the chick who plays a bitchy mom on the OC shove glass into her own boob (yeah, you read that right) 
 The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 I hated this film. I saw the original French film which this is based on and absolutely loved it. This remake is terrible and I gape at Jean Reno agreeing to go through with it. I don't speak French and it's not necessary with the subtitles that come with the original. Don't get this film get the real thing 
 We just bought this for our 3 yr old daughter and the strings don't work as indicated.  We'll see if the replacement will work.  My daughter still thought it was great, but I expect it to work fully for the price 
 I had to read this book because of a school project. This was a terrible book. I hated it from the beginning because it had no plot, story line, or good characters. About halfway through the book, one of the main characters, Mando, just left. it didn't say where or why he left, but Scott O'Dell didn't bring him back in the book. I am a little glad because Mando was just a pain. But unfortuanatly, Zia stayed. She was in every scene and was very boring. If anyone wants to read it, then i hope this helps you... THROW IT AWAY!! 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 This album for sure sounds live.There apparently were no studio touchups.The way a live album is supposed to sound.But the songs selected are for particular tastes only. 
 This book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won't heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy. 
 The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 i bought this cd and was totally disapointed with it no where does it say not by origional artists this is a very bad cd of redone music by even worse artists save your mone 
 They are all identical.  He reminds me very much of TV evangelists.  No advice that is worth your money.  Go buy "We Shall Not Fail: The Inspiring Leadership of Winston Churchill" or "Speak Like Churchill, Stand Like Lincoln: 21 Powerful Secrets of History's Greatest Speakers".  I beg you 
 Overemphasis on sexual material.  Would not have bought the book had I known this. Believe Amazon "missed the boat" in recommending it to the general public.  I am very disappointed 
 PLEASE NOTE: I am reviewing this recording as an *audiophile* and as someone immersed in *historically informed performance*. If either or both of these things puts you in a decidedly different aesthetic camp from mine, then *disregard* the rating I have given it. I do not mean to offend those who love this recording.  I will not argue with those who think this is "magnificent" or "passionate," but I think it is misleading, and even a disservice to people browsing for a recording of this symphony, to call this "essential" and "indispensable" (Amazon) or "the 9th to own" (below). It is a remarkable recording, but I think it would be a shame if someone knew this symphony only or primarily from this recording.  As everyone mentions, this was an historic occasion: the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival, and for some a symbol of Germany's cultural rebirth after the war. It was the last time Furtwängler was at Bayreuth. If one contemplates these things while listening to this recording, it is indeed easy to be swept up by it. I respectfully suggest that knowledge of its context has prompted some to attribute to it a sort of mystical greatness that it really does not possess.  EMI has done what seems like a very respectable job remastering this recording, and it probably sounds as good as it ever will. The peculiar acoustic properties of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus and orchestra pit also give it an interesting character. But this is a live, mono recording from 1951. What makes it special is the sensation of "listening back in time." The recorded sound itself, jumbled and indistinct, cannot even be compared to what can be achieved with modern recording techniques.  As for the performance, Furtwängler may be considered by many to be without peer for his insight into this music, but this is simply not my Beethoven; nor, I believe, is it Beethoven's Beethoven. Furtwängler's "insight" borders on unlistenable in the third movement: 19'32". For me, this kills the performance all on its own. Parts of it actually sound as though they are being played in "slow motion," and sometimes it seems that Furtwängler has slipped into his own private meditation and forgotten he is leading a performance. The cringe-inducing brass section, however heartfelt their efforts, does not help matters.  Collectors and those with an historical interest in the political, social and artistic events surrounding this recording will want to own it, but I think this would be a poor choice for one's first or only recording, legendary though it is.  I highly recommend John Eliot Gardiner's version on Archiv for an articulate, driven, and, in its own way, every bit as passionate alternative to lumbering late Romantic interpretations 
 You can understand the basic principles of this book, but that's about it. The in-depth explanation makes you want to learn about something else 
 It's sooo easy to take a cheap shot and say that Anne Bird wrote this to finance her wine/carpaccio/Disneyland/Xanax habit, but if she did, that's okay.  Catherine Crier wrote a brilliant book about the Peterson case and I doubt all the proceeds are going to charity.  But what to make of this poorly written and not-terribly-well-thought-out book?  First of all, Ms. Bird clearly has some issues with being adopted, though why I don't know--her adoptive parents are loving, supportive, and RICHRICHRICH, as she takes pains to alert us.  I guess she's annoyed that Scott was considered the family "golden boy," though in my experience those kids generally end up worse than their siblings.  (My spouse has an acquaintance whose mother also considered him the "golden boy" and who could do no wrong--she even defended him when he put his own brother in the hospital.  He'll probably end up in court one day and his mother will be there pulling a Jackie Peterson).  But Ms. Bird just LOVES everybody when she first meets them, although she makes sure to tell us "I know it seems as if I liked everybody indiscriminately, but I'm actually not that way" (not a direct quote, obviously).  She thinks some aspects of Jackie Peterson's behavior is creepy--though it struck me that Mrs. Peterson was probably just awkward in the situation, who wouldn't be?--but nonetheless she and the Petersons go on trips to Disneyland, the shore, fancy restaurants, etc.  She proclaims that she and Laci are practically soul sisters though they meet about four times and only rarely talk on the phone.  Despite Ms. Bird's avowal that the purpose of her book is to "get justice for Laci and Conner" (this was accomplished at the trial, Anne!) Laci is a cardboard character who likes flowers, shopping, and complains about her aching back.    There are some interesting tidbits about Scott and the rest of the Peterson clan, which saves the book from a 1-star rating.  We already knew about his porn channels, of course, but the pattern of silly lies (like claiming he and Laci were going to name the baby "California"--Anne hilariously writes "I didn't know what to make of that"), going out boozing with Anne while the search is going on, Jackie's defense of Scott's lies to Amber Frey with "Well, he's been all those places!"--if it weren't for the fact that a woman and her unborn baby are dead, these people would make wonderful Springer or Maury guests.  This includes Ms. Bird, who sits watching "Murder, She Wrote," neglecting her kids and jeopardizing her marriage because "He's my brother."  I'd argue that her adoptive siblings are her "brothers," but I guess she feels differently.  Her "33 reasons" are pretty ludicrous (Laci was almost certainly NOT killed in the pool) consisting primarily of such insights that Scott Peterson was at Cal Poly when Kristen Smart disappeared (again, almost certainly not a connection), Scott making "flirtinis" for the babysitter and getting into the Mile-High club (again, chilling details, but not dispositive).  She also "reads" guilt into a tale Scott weaved for her regarding a children's cemetery that he and Laci supposedly stumbled on and a vision that Scott had of Laci.  Again, Scott's guilty--but these stories don't really tell us much that we don't get in Catherine Crier's far superior book.       As for dissembling, Anne Bird proves she's not above it herself.  We are asked to believe that upon hearing Laci is dead, her three-year-old son takes his crib mattress and tries to drag it outside saying, "I'm going to put this outside for Aunt Laci for when she falls down from the heavens."  PLEASE!  Also, for all her talk about believing Scott to be innocent at first, she seems curiously eager to get involved in the case.  She had absolutely no useful information to give either the defense or the prosecution (seems like she tried one, then the other) and when she failed to get her sufficient 15 minutes of fame, she hitches her wagon to Gloria Allred and peddles her stories in this book.  If you can borrow a friend's copy or check it out of the library, it's a fun read if you were a Peterson trial junkie (which probably includes most of the country). Again, stories of the wildly dysfunctional Petersons would be funnier if Laci and Connor weren't horribly dead...but Anne's working out her "adoptee" issues, so I guess it's all right.  Uhhh-huhhh.....       
 Although I knew this movie might not fit my expectations, I still ordered all three parts in a box from British amazon, much because of its cult status among horror fans. Actually I wanted to watch this since I was a boy. And I was right as well as many reviewers (I mean about expectations) - "It's Alive" appeared to be rather boring and not scary at all. The only pluses I saw in it are great work by John P. Ryan (I always adored him) and that nostalgic feeling I got while watching. And by nostalgic I mean the epoch of 70s itself shown in the film, and the way movie was shot. Nowdays we used to see monsters from the first minutes on screen, and in "It's Alive" we get to see the evil baby just closer to the end.  Anyway I think the film lacks some brutality and real horror, maybe they'll come up with something more infernal in the sequel which is being planned, as I heard.  But in general "It's Alive" is quite OK for a low budget movie that doesn't claim to be a masterpiece of horror genre. Buy it if you like old cheesy horror films, especially those which became legends a long time ago.  
 I am amazed at the positive reviews I have read about this book. Unfortunately, I took their advice and bought it.  The book tries to follow the approach of teaching by example by developing compiler/interpreter components and utilities in C++. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a computer program printout, and rapidly becomes too boring to follow.  There is very little theoretical background to the concepts behind creating compilers and interpreters. Attemping to learn from the C++ code will rapidly confirm that the code is of very poor quality, and seems to be a bodged conversion from C rather than a native C++ development.  Avoid this book at all costs. It is especially dangerous for C++ novices as following the code will teach bad practices and lead you to believe that C++ is just C with classes. It is useless for experienced C++ programmers who wish to learn about compiler/interpreter programming techniques 
 If you grew up loving David Crosby and all that you thought he stood for, and do not want to hear tirades on the rights to bear arms and how Indian tribal sovereignty is a threat to the American democracy, don't read this book. If you don't want to read ignorant comparisons of the discrimimation of the Irish with the cultural genocide of the American Indians, don't read this book. If you don't want the credibility of the timbers of your musical roots shaken to the core, don't read this book 
 This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book 
 One of the exciting possibilities in visiting Italy is always the hope of finding a local artisan making one-of-a-kind handcrafted items.  Thus, it was with great hope that I ordered Ms. Morelli's book, expecting she had trod the out of the way streets to find undiscovered talent.  Not so.  While the title is Made in Italy, the book really could have been Made on Google.  There is little info that one could not find through a Google search, or just walking around the main piazze of the towns listed.  And there is much needless fillers: how many times have you yearned to buy a $36,000 gondola in Venice?  Or need to be told where to purchase prosciutto di Parma or parmigiano reggiano?  You can go to any local supermarket in Italy or the US. This book might be helpful to someone who has NEVER been to Italy as an overview of each region.  For anyone else, it's another case of a person and a publisher trying to make a quick buck on people's love of Italy.  For shame on them 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 Historically inaccurate, a painfully rushed third act, and not up to the high standards set by Philippa Gregory's other Tudor novels. It reads like something written by a well-intentioned romance author. What amazed me was the author's decision to write a Katharine of Aragon that bore absolutely no resemblance to the historical figure. I've found all her previous Tudor character studies to be incredibly believeable(notwithstanding Elizabeth I's excessive randiness in The Virgin's Lover). Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII himself, all seem to come alive. Why then is Katharine of Aragon groping her husband on her wedding night, dressing in the Tudor equivalent of a naughty negligee, and seducing her father-in-law for the sake of politics?  This "racy" view is completely at odds with every historical source which portrays Catalina de Aragon as a intensely religious, reserved woman who would never repeatedly perjure herself. For a rigorously devoted Roman Catholic to live such a lie her entire life (to say nothing of the sexual politics she is depicted as playing) would be live a life of sin. There is nothing in the historical record to ever suggest Katharine would choose that path.   If Philippa Gregory wants to write a purely fictitious re-imagining of Katharine of Aragon, that's fine (I've always wanted more exploration of what her life might have been like if Prince Arthur hadn't died). But to claim this character is based on fact is both laughable and insulting to all authors who strive for historical accuracy 
 This was a light weight and I ended up just flipping through it. If you are intersted in this topic I suggest you read Dr. Phil's book entitled, Love Smart. It is practical, helpful, and you will walk aways from it with tools to move forward in the area of relationship. This book, Love Will Find You, is a lot of air 
 I am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by FAR the most one-sided book I've ever read.  It wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of Aileen Wuornos.  He has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular.  He made Ms. Wuornos out to be someone she wasn't.  She had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about.  Again, it wasn't worth the $.  I actually threw my copy of this away 
 I should have known, with a Dedication, Acknowledgments, an Introduction, and 5 epigraphs before Chapter One even begins, that this book was in trouble. Some nuggets of interesting information are buried in awkward writing, and terrible editing. P. 43, last line, is missing the word "he." On p. 41 the author is off by 50 million people as to the current U.S. population. On p. 104, President Eisenhower did not begin his second term until Jan. 1957, not Jan. 1956.    In an amateurish manner, the author tries to relate then-current events with the arc of Armstrong's life. In the process he butchers the former, drawing away from the wonder of the latter. More errors: on p. 223, he gets the directions of downtown Chicago all wrong: the Conrad Hilton hotel is not off Lincoln Park, but Grant Park. On p. 247 the author goes so far as to blame the Apollo 13 disaster on Jim Lovell: not even Hollywood took things that far!    On p. 279, the author should realize that the mini-van saved Chrysler, not Neil Armstrong's advertising campaign! And on p. 288, President "Reagan" is spelled "Regan," and in reciting the Challenger speech, the author misses the key passage of one of the great presidential speeches of history: "slipping the bonds of earth . . .""     Don't waste your time with this book. I listened to the author on C-SPAN2's book notes a few weeks back, and it is apparent from his shallow comments why this is such a weak effort. I just wish I had seen the show BEFORE I wasted the $ on this book 
 Let me explain the situation.  We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball.  Sound familiar?  Probably not.  I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept.  Recomendation?  I have none.  I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film 
 Reading the reviews on Amazon.com about "The Third Eye" I wonder if many of them were written by the same person.  I am suspicious.  "The Third Eye" is mildly entertaining, but if it is not true, then it does affect my perception of it.  I am sorry.  I could have written as good a book, since I have read lots about Tibet, but not been there in this body.  The theology chapter "Tibetan Beliefs" is patently ludicrous.  I know enough about Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism, to spot this as a quaint concoction by a Christian (or formerly Christian) Westerner.  I was also offended by the forceful assertion that there *IS* a GOD (italics his), and that it doesn't matter what we call Him.  God is a fact.  Smells pretty fishy to me.  Then he "explains" what Om Mani Padme Hum means.   "Hail to Man's Overself!"  WHAAAATT???  Is that Nietzsche or who?    I was not impressed by the advice in the book on how to relax.  Imagine falling off a cliff and laying there all sprawled and lack-jawed from your SPLAT onto the Earth.  Come on!    This is pure fiction and not even good fiction 
 I came to this film with the attitude of enjoying a bit of ridiculous 'camp'.  Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman sporting Nawlins accents?  I couldn't pass that up.  Well, even with the right attitude coming in, it was at times painful.  Emma's dialect coach should have been shot; Alan did better, at least he sounded like he was aiming at a southern accent, but he tends to drawl a bit anyhow so maybe it was easier for him.  However, Emma and Alan are only supporting characters.  The main characters are not terrible or anything, but really not that compelling.  Oh, the plot.  The film does have a good plot, and it could have been interesting, but nonetheless I found it a bit plodding.  And as others, have noted, the editting is so weak it's comical.  Oh actually there is a quite memorable scene: the cunnilingus scene in a meat locker.  Wow, that was...um...unusual.  Well, Emma and Alan fans will no doubt watch it, but save it for a slow mid-week night.  Actually, any Emma fans with a sense of humor should definitely watch this at some point.  Emma is obviously having a good time, and seeing her dangle a cigarette while tailing on roller blades is something else.  It just you might not want to choose this as a film to watch with friends, unless you want to expose the depths to which you will descend to watch Emma or Alan on the screen.  Addendum: Alan plays a good character here.  It's a nice lite break if you've been working through his films where he often plays morally ambiguous (or not so ambiguous) characters in films that explore difficult themes

 If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it 
 I bought the vacuum because of the good reviews on several sites.  I, however, found the vacuum to be very lacking in performance.  It didn't pick up well at all.  It is EXTREMELY heavy and therefore hard to push around.  I was completely unsatisfied and am shipping it back.  Amazon, on the other hand, was amazing.  They had the UPS come to my house to pick it up and didn't charge me shipping for the return 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 teenage vegans and vegetarians aren't stupid people. if i had read this befor i had gone vegan, i probably wouldn't have... there are so many other great books out there with better information. try anne marie colbin's "food and healing.&quot 
 The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in Mail-in-Rebate. Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode, SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode. How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode?  In my experience with SanDisk, I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50% of the time with SanDisk. I think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies. Don't trust it! 
 For such a serious subject matter, I was surprised and even curious that the author's bio or expertise is regulated to the back of the paperback book in one sentence. The other two sentences are related to media appearance and praise. (Choosing not to Google her, I read the book anyways).  note: the quotes are from the book.  On page 35 and 150 a bookmercial was introduced for another of the author's book instead of discussions on why the subject matter would be a trait or characteristic of a controlling person.   On page 71-74 two separate stories explaining a concept "defining .. were a way of connecting". The stories did not indicated how long a "stranger" had to be in your presence before such a concept could be triggered. If these people were at the same convention that the author attended, how long was the presentation, did she see them at the convention, did she talk to those two people in a question and answer session, or were they just the fans?  At what point does the switch get triggered in the stranger's action for them to feel comfortable in crossing the "psychic boundary".  on page 165 I think the author missed an opportunity to share a control type situation outside a "couple or parent relationship". ie "I'm your therapist. You should follow my advice." IMHO Lea was also attracting people into her life who wanted to control her in addition to her relationship with Vic.    Lastly, on page 288-290 you can participate in a survey geared for "Spell bound" issues for the Patricia Evans, Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute.  There isn't any background on what the Insitutes does or is even mentioned in the book.  IMHO I would not recommend this book to anyone. I can see why many readers would feel a connection with the book.  There are several stories that a person would relate to if they were in a controlling relationship, but I step back and think about how can a person get pointers on when the control activity begins to occur. Do you have to wait several years or  decades to figure out that the relationship has a problem in it. I think there are always warning signals. ie on p 29 when "Ted ... was beside himself." 
 My daughter loves Little Einsteins, but we were dissapointed in this item.  She doesn't pay much attention to it 
 I used to own a cassette of "Stangers In the Night" way back in the 70's. What an amazing concert in terms of vocals & riffs. This compilation is a critical review by a bunch of guys I've never even heard about - What a let down. I had hoped that this would contain the entire footage of the concert. Its Audio & video are terrible. Please checkout other concerts of UFO which are available, I'm sure they would be better 
 The other reviewers were right! Thank God I only borrowed the book from the public library. Had I bought it I would have demanded a refund.  Is this really Evanovich writing? Or is it mostly Hughes? I find it hard to believe that she can write this bad after reading the Plum series.  Max is ultra rich, established right away in the first chapter who thinks he knows everything there is to know. As for his car Muffin... I'm not so sure what to say about a menopausal car.  Jamie sounds dumb, like a flat character trying to find dimension.  The story, plot, etc. leaves much to be desired. Good thing they put a limit as to how low your rating can get or this would be a negative 
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 Lewis was an eloquent and thoughtful explorer of his own experience. Several biographers have written biographies that honor Lewis while filling in some of the details of his life Lewis was more reticent about revealing.  This book is a shoddily written and seemingly unedited canonization of Lewis that reminds us on virtually every page how superior in intellect, work habits and character he is to everyone else in his orbit. Given his private and respectful nature, it's not hard to imagine that Lewis would have found this book disgusting for the way in which Gresham pillories his beloved brother, adopted family and some colleagues, all to set off Lewis in a better light. Yet there are contradictory moments such as when Gresham mentions that due to his age, depression over Joy's death, health problems and work away from home, Lewis was an absent and indifferent step-parent.  This book adds nothing to Lewis biography, no insight into his writings, and it contains no reference or notes. Though the book convinces one of Gresham's admiration for Lewis, its fulsomeness reminds one of nothing so much as blatant exploitation 
 This book is for all you liberal feminists out there.  Don't buy it if you really want a good read.  It's great as a door stop, though 
 I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a non-realistic cutsie book to pass the time.  The book starts with a good premise: what the elaborate ritual of college admissions really tells about a person and who he or she is.  However, the story gets lost with odd twists, turns, and irrelevant plot lines.  This poorly written maze of a book about nothing isn't exactly written for teens as it heavily focuses on the emotions of the stress of parents sending their children away.  There are some mildly amusing parts as Dylan goes through various college interviews.  However, most of these situations are cliché and predictable.  The more unintentional amusing parts of this book is watching the author, James Finney Boylan, attempt to create characters that talk like modern day teenagers.  Someone should tell this guy no one calls each other "dickweed" or "dude" in every sentence.  Another thing that is annoying is that he writes like he is still in junior high.  One may notice he shifts from the narrator talking in first person to third person at various points.  He also used convoluted vocabulary in an attempt to add some sort of depth to the writing.  So if you are really bored, there may be some humorous things in this book to read, mostly unintentional 
 This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate.  His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book 
 There seem to be a lot of readers who enjoy Pavel's style of 'writing', or at least, are easily convinced by the prose of his ads. Of course, it's hard to separate the ads from the books, which are loaded with ads themselves. I'm convinced that all one needs to -know- about stretching can be put into one small pamphlet. Actually, Pavel proves this in his first book by putting in a pamphlet's worth of info , and filling the rest with blank spaces, un-humorous anecdotes, too-big pics, and ads! I bet even -he- was surprised that the public was willing to keep buying the same info over and over , each time for ten time what it's worth. Amazing.   
 Rev. Dyson  dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern America. I found the chapter concerning Dr. King's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening, but I found the Rev. Dyson handing out alibis for King's adultery disappointing. Equally mind blowing is Dyson's using overblown language to assail the King family's efforts to control their loved one's image. I wonder why there are hard feelings, since Dexter and Coretta King talked to him for this book. This is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels, but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter 
 I'm another Stephen Hunter fan who was deeply disappointed by this one -- my guess is that Hunter wrote it on autopilot, as an exercise in self-indulgence.  It's predictable, plays on a silly "seven against Thebes" allusion, and even has an uneducated Mississipi black guy say, "I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."  If you're new to Hunter, try POINT OF IMPACT, which would be a strong candidate, for me, to be ranked the best thriller ever written. 
 I purchased this book, hoping it would examine the _ancient_ Egyptian source of the ideas within the Corpus Hermeticum. But, in that respect this book is entitled in a misleading manner. The author is a researcher for the Center for _Greek_ and _Roman_ Antiquity of the National _Hellenic_ Research Foundation in _Athens_. And, as the name of his foundation clearly implies, his academic zeal begins and ends with Greece and Rome.  Yes, everyone knows that the Corpus Hermeticum we now have was written by Greeks. But, my interest is in discovering the Kemetian source those Greeks worked from to come up with their Corpus Hermeticum. Alas, this book was no help.  
 What a disgrace to John Carpenter. The original "Halloween" was the greatest horror movie ever made. How could this stupid, unimaginative, confusing mess be allowed to share the name "Halloween"? Who is responsible for this travesty of taste? Who wrote this story, a first grader? This movie has the dumbest ending I have ever seen. How could this terrible movie have made it into theatres? Doesn't someone screen movies? Someone needs to be held accountable for this and needs to be punished very severely 
 Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.   Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.   Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.   Alterman tells us that "when it bleeds, it leads". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on.   
 I thought these lights would be just what I was looking for, but I was a bit disappointed at their lack of brightness; they just don't light the tank enough to show it off.  I have a 40 gallon tank and purchased one of these for each side.  It comes with two clips to hold the light.  The clips can be attached to the outside of the tank with double sided tape (included) or to the wall or other surface with screws (also included).  I placed mine in the existing hoods next to the florescent bulbs.  I think the soft, blue light is rather nice, but inadequate. 
 Neither the Amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. I have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'Songs for Swinging Lovers' - Frank Sinatra or Beethoven's Opera Fidelio - conductor Otto Klemperer (Testament Label). The material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings. I did not hear anything outstanding on this CD to make me overlook the 'mono' factor.   Is this some great jazz masterpiece, recorded live in Carnegie Hall by two giants of Jazz? I personally don't think so. Somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then Elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old.  With small jazz bands, I like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis.  Examples: 'Sunday at the Village Vanguard - Bill Evans Trio' or 'New York Reunion - McCoy Tyner Quartet'. I wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording. This material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados. It may have been hasty but after one listen I decided to sell this CD and I have no regrets other than buying it in the first place. 
 The subject was interesting to me but the author is not easy to read.  Her sentence structure is often convoluted, I found myself having to reread many sentences to grasp the meaning.  She also refers to people,dates and places in such a way that it is difficult to keep track of what is going on.  Finally, her perspective is very sympathetic to MS, its obvious the author is a feminist 
 Got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall, I need to purchase a $4.00 part and pay $5.00 shipping and taxes.  Now all the specs say wall mountable, not wall mountable with an extra purchase!  Ok, $8-10 isn't going to break me, but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall!  So, since I can't mount it on the wall, I haven't used it yet!  Have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in... 
 I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.  Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.  They are horrid to wear, I oredered size small for all colours, and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.  DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.  You've got to be con artist to sell these things 
 Okay, I got hooked on MiGo mugs a few years ago because they keep my coffee hot. They are suberb for that purpose. However this new version has a lid that apparently requires a special tool to remove. I used a butter knife. How convenient! Perhaps next time they could pencil in a lip to make it easier to remove! 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 I can't describe how disappointed I was in this book.  I read some of the other reviews and was so excited when I got it for Christmas.  But, my exitement quickly faded.  I thought the book was way too chatty, and I hated the guy-o-meter.  I'm sticking with Cooking Light for healthy cooking 
 i don't understand why anyone would want to buy these sets when you can buy all the seasons for just a little more money!!!! 
 I have been a long time fan of Grafton's since her first "A" book and have read every one since that. I even travelled far and wide , toting my three-year-old to go to a book signing and meet her in person.  But...what happened? Is she running out of material or trying to find a way to quickly reach her book quota? I kept wondering what happened to the Kinsey I fell in love with in A through M. She's become dull, boring and so damn well...good. Where's the Kinsey that had gumption, broke the rules and dusted her banister with her underwear? Not only was there no clean ending, no closure or case solved but the plot was boring and predictable. With this, we had to put up with two old bickering men.  Sue, please oh please bring back the old "fun" Kinsey that we all miss! Get her drunk, give her a believeable love interest and bring back the action and suspense that we know you're capable of 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I teach drama/theater in a low income public school. I bought the book because my school has very few resources and I thought this might be useful. As it turned out the book was hardly used during my first year teaching. My biggest problem with this book is that it is not very user friendly for a teacher who just wants to add some fun to a class but not a complex game. In other words the book needs to make the games simpler so the kids can pick them up faster and have more fun. This might not be problem for teachers in high school as your students might be more mature and able to handle more complex games. But for middle school teachers tread lightly. Also if you have a bunch of behavior problems in your class then forgot about it. In my experience I found the worse the behavior the better they were at spoiling fun classroom games. Be warned 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Usually when one writes a negative review, Amazon readers say the review was not helpful.  Also, Amazon tends to make their "spotlight reviews" the good ones.  This book is a decidedly mixed bag.  On the positive side: the author clearly identifies the schtick of famous comedians; he has made up exercises to "practice" the steps one needs to take to be "funny;" he makes good comments about how to be a writer or comedian in the public spotlight.  So this is a technically competent book.  Yet little of the humor in the book is actually funny, or at least to my taste funny.  I never thought Jack E. Leonard was funny, I detested Don Rickles' aggressive and demeaning "humor;" Rodney Dangerfield was significantly depressed so I always felt sick when I heard his jokes; Jackie Gleason was a self-involved fat turkey who did not like women, etc., etc.  Yet we can see where Helitzer's favorite comics come from: his theory is that humor "is about superiority."    So much for irony, understatement, significant pauses, or just treating people to something funny 
 I, too, wish I could get my money and time back...even though it only took me 3 hours to read it over 2 days. I laughed 4 times in the whole book. I just expected more from Larry. The last couple chapters were the funniest, and the part about Easter made me laugh out loud...but the rest was just crude. I can take crudeness but the CONSTANT mention of the "t" word for breasts was annoying. I've always hated that word and this just sealed it. I really enjoy watching Larry's cable specials but this book was just a disappointment 
 Iowa workshop anthology with a few other usual suspects as well as other signs of nepotism.  How sad.  Shuffle the pages and look at the cards: you've got only one suit 
  I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.  But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!! 
 I became disappointed in the book from the first chapter and it got worse.  This book does not help.  It does urge you to belong to a church group and to pattern your job search using the Bible.  There are questions at the end of each chapter but there is no guidance as to what to do with your answers.  I urge anyone on a job hunt to aviod this drivel.  It wasted my time and should not waste yours 
 the script is garbage...as if they made it up as they were going along ( the amount of production goofs prove it).....even a golf ball knows you can stop a train by killing the power to the third rail...the subway chase scene ?...catching a train on a motorcycle ?...the two trains ramming at high speed ? ugh hello !!!this movie was a complete waste of time and to be avoided at all costs......if your into trains by any means, dig into the archives and discover "the taking of pelham one two three 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 page 289 tells us we will be re-incarnated. I never read that in the Bible 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 The train does not autostop as advertised. My two year old forgets to turn it off (not that he could) and it just runs and runs until the battery dies 
 This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic "leak stopper", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak.  
 Eisenman dissects the Casa Del Fascio as a pathologist would examine a corpse.  In simplistic diagrams the building's parts are duly chronicled in uninspired prose. One is left with the impression that he has examined a piece of graph paper with coordinates and alignments. That the building represented human endeavor, or embodied cultural aspirations seems lost on Eisenman in this humdrum attempt at scholarship.   Knowing the nihilistic, anti-human qualities of Eisenman's superficial approach to design, and the ever-mutable "logic" in his work, this is no surprise. He lacks any intuitive understanding of space or scale and a lifetime of pretentious writing has not equipped him for the serious task at hand. Ever since Eisenman indulged himself placing columns in the middle of a client's dining table, he has gotten away with his preposterous intellectual gimmickry, passing it off as "challenging", the stock-in-trade excuse for ridiculous and contrived design. [Interestingly, when it came to his own apartment, Eisenman handed off the work to another firm who produced a fairly cozy design.  This hypocrisy shows a lack of sincerity in his unrefined speculations, and no thinking person should ever take Eisenman seriously again.]  This lowbrow rhetoric has served as a handy tool for the mediocre academic whose primary audience is susceptible students. But Eisenman's shaky credibility is rapidly and thankfully waning, the result of absurd quasi-intellectual hypotheses which produced crude buildings, no single one of which has achieved enduring respect.  Revisionist histories already marginalize him as a sideshow huckster, an irritating distraction from more meaningful debates developing elsewhere.  Worried about this legacy, and trying to curtail a widening flow of criticism about his crumbling oeuvre, the Terragni book supposedly was his pitch to more lasting fame.  But this bumbling attempt at scholarship fails as a serious academic study more rapidly than his buildings failed as credible works of architecture.   Eisenman never understood the crucial difference between diagrams and buildings.  This lethargic and unperceptive book offers tedious quantities of them in lieu of keenly observed criticism.  For an exercise that occupied some 40 years of his life, there's very little to show for it.  Ill equipped for incisive inquiry, he offers one-dimensional reporting.  For Eisenman, the dubious theorist who's act endorsed nihilism and alienation as though they were virtues, history will probably deny this sad and foolish man a favorable mention.   Reading this rather desperate attempt to reinvent himself as a historian, one is tempted to feel sorry for him looking back on a wasted career.  But considering the lack of sincerity in Eisenman's work and his disregard for our shared environment, sympathy is hardly a suitable reason to bother with this inept dissertation today. 
 The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint.  The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system.  My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.    This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first. 
 I don't get the positive reviews.  This author rehashes information that is in all of your basic finance books.  This would make a good magazine article, but it's a waste of 400 pages.  I'll save you $20 and give you the entire book here: 1. Mututal funds are usually ran in the interest of the company, not yours. 2. It's really hard to beat the market. 3. All of the fees and soft-dollaring reduce your investment returns greatly.  But you probably already knew this 
 I hoped I could leave the theatre, but I was hoping it would get better. Here let me put it this way: 3-D sucked Plot sucked Actors sucked Movie sucked PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!! 
 I must admit that I find Christine Feehan's "Dark" desires deeply disturbing in many ways, and this book, along with _Dark Secret_, is the most disturbing. I was happy when rape stopped being such an essential part of romance novels; I still remember reading Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers' novels when I was young and being freaked out by how often the heroine ended up falling in love with the man who had raped her. But Feehan's books have returned us to those dark days, when sexy heroes force themselves on young and innocent heroines, who then blame themselves for tempting the heroes beyond reason - just as Savannah not only excuses Gregori for raping her, but actually blames herself for wanting some choice and freedom in her life. Frankly, the whole doomed Carpathian species/lifemate thing seems like an excuse to indulge in the misogynist fantasies that say that men can't control their sexuality and that women like to be raped. It is possible to write sexy paranormal romance/erotica that doesn't indulge in the most retrogade gender stereotypes around. Try Emma Holly. 
 We should all be for Mr. Ravi Batri.  By selling enough copies of this book and its sequel ("Surviving the Great Depression of 1990"), he singlehandedly prevented worldwide economic collapse 
 This disc lacks imagination. They sound Creed like but they are a wee bit softer. I dont like this music anymore but when I did I failed to realize that Kutless lacks meaning in their songs. I mean look at the titles Down, Away, Tonight. Not that these songs are confusing metaphors like some Christian rocker"s songs are. These songs lack depth and creativity. And the music sounds like any other band out today.   I would stay away from this. Listen to Creed instea 
 I bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries. I was surely mistaken. The raspberries are coated with sugar, and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears! GROSS 
 Mens, wat zingt deze sufgeneukte parkiet vals. Negeren!  Probeer eens echte muziek 
 This isn't a kids book at all. The message behind it is one of choice, making reference to a woman's right to choose through horton and the planet. I don't care what your views on abortion are (anti or pro), you shouldn't let young children read and decyfer the hidden meaning. Dr. Seuss was a nut job and a child corrupter, don't support his work.  
 "I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, after 2 weeks, the round thing on top of the watch came off.  The seller says it has to be sent to repair..and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back. I am so embarassed of the poor quality gift I chose and can't belive they will not replace it ..with an apology...their answer is just not acceptable." But there is nothing else I can do but write this review, I have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews I read I was happy with the gift..but now ...I am so disapointe 
 The odering process was easy and came in a timely fashion.  I am very satisfie 
 The disapearance of USSR was terrible for Tom Clancy - it deprived Jack Ryan of real evil enemy so the author had to invent some new ones. After going through the Japanese and the Arabs he couldn't find nothing better than... vegetarians!!!  This whole book is a pathetic joke! Good Lord, when I think that once I actually DIDN't sleep for 48 hours because I couldn't stop reading "The Cardinal of Kremlin". Mr Clancy Sir  you were so great in the past - what happened? Now every next of your books is simply worse than the previous... And just to be clear - politically I am as much on the right (Republican) side than you, so this is not just the hostility of a political enemy but a sincere disappointment of a former fan Could you try to write something good once more? In memory of good old times? Please? 
 I bought this a while back and began finding problems with it right away.  1) The trimmer cannot operate on A/C power alone.  This means you can't plug it into the wall and use it.  Instead, you have to charge the battery, then unplug it to use it.  2) About 2 weeks after I bought it, the beard trimmer attachment broke.  The little tabs that hold it at different lengths snapped off so you can only use it on the shortest setting, and you have to hold the attachment on with your hand so it won't slide off.  Clearly, I'm not the only one who this has happened to.  3) The nose trimmer has very dull blades. I don't normally use a nose trimmer nor do I really need one, but I have a cheap one that I got in my Christmas stocking that I've used a few times.  Out of curiosity, I tried the attachment that came with this trimmer and was introduced to a new kind of pain.  It was pulling at the hairs but not cutting them.  I contacted the a representative at Norelco to see if I they would send me a replacement beard attachment or if I could purchase just that attachment.  They directed me to their service centers who wanted $10 for just that attachment.  Including shipping, it would have cost me almost what I payed for the whole set.  My advice:  pay a little more for something sturdier.  That's what I plan on doing 
 My wife is an accomplished cook. Like another reviewer from Va - She could not get the Monkey Bread and a few other Recipes to work. She only prepares food from 'scratch' and is very well versed in technique. The book is beautiful but!! 
 Hey, look at my review title, I'm playing the historical race card too! Before we compare our pesky scorned eurocentric models and archetypes to Afrocentric 'black/negroid' models and archetypes, let us look at the basic 'historical/cultural' facts. First, the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Carthaginians which inhabitated the northern fringe of Africa and Asia, and did influence the Hellenes,  were Semitic/Hamitic peoples....NOT negroid....Eventually the black Nubians did rule over a later Ancient Egypt for a time, but this was past the cultural mingling  stages between the Hamitic Egyptians and the Ancient Hellenes.  Minoan Crete knew of the Egyptians. Crete never depicted the Egyptians with black/negroid features. If anything, they bore a slight resemblance to the Minoans.  This guy's farfetched theories do not add up, they are riddled with obvious contradictions and totally bogus assumptions.  Athena is Semitic before she is black. Though she had braided hair in some depictions, she was not dark in complexion or ample in the facial features. A straight nose, not a wide nose.  Better yet she was neither Semitic, or black...but Greek. Seeing it is the Ancient Greeks who worshipped her....NOT the Semites or blacks.            
 Although this book is supposed to be helpful guide, the author manages to group most Latinos into one large culture to discuss. As another reviewer states, when the author is not writing about Latinos in general, she seems to know and write more about Mexican culture. I am looking for a guide that would help me plan a wedding with Cuban traditions, and though this book is not insightful in that area, I did find the section on how to format an invitation in the traditional "Y" layout helpful. If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have not bought it and only taken notes on the invitation area. I would not recommend this book, yet unfortunately, it is the only book I know of that makes an effort to write about Latino weddings 
 One month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine. My car's engine sounds better. Don't waste your money. I called Sharp and they say is the fan. Great, maybe I should remove it and use ice cubes 
 I could never get this book. It took my twenty years of reading the Divided Self to fully understand this author. This book was also titled the bird of paradise, but is not the book the other reviewer thought it was, that was also a book by RD Laing but with another author and also had the word *family* in the title. This book originally was not like an accounting of families but philosophical and psychiatric speculation. This book is all fine for someone studying psychology or psychiatry but for fellow consumers of mental health or their families I would say avoid this rather weighty tome 
 We just bought a house and I bought many interior design/home decorating books recently and screened through a bunch in a book store. I bought this one because I saw it was named as a best seller, and I seriously do not understand how could this become a best seller, maybe best seller 5 tears ago? When the book arrived from Amzon, both my husband and I were shocked: Who would want to design like that? The pictures are simply ugly!!! Both the pictures and text are so dated, and the text type is the smallest I have ever seen. I could not bare to read two paragraphs because my eyes were too strained 
 This book, as well as the sequels, contain a few truths, many half-truths and many falsehoods. God has given us free will and would not force someone's hand to write things. This book states there is no wrong and no right. And in one of the sequels, he states that Hitler is in heaven *because he doesn't view his actions as wrong.* What convenient thinking for the rest of us! And what dangerous thinking! The road to Heaven is narrow, not a superhighway. I fear many souls will be lost by following the false teachings of this book. 
 Not a spy thriller, but a novel about self-absorbed middle-aged men who happen to be former spies. Which is fine, except the book is sold as a thriller, and the blurb is full of praise for the "tension" and "pace". Talk about false advertising! The story really only gets going in the last 70 pages or so, and then it suddenly ends without any resolution.  Even considers as a character study with no pretensions as a spy thriller, this book disappoints. It's far too full of annoying "What-ho old chap" overgrown "public" (i.e. private) schoolboys, and the main characters are totally unsympathetic; Cranmer is a sad sack, Pettifer (encountered only in flashback) is a narcissistic boor, and Emma (likewise only seen in flashback) is a vacuous airhead.  Thirty years ago, Le Carre might have taken this premise and made something worth reading out of it. Once every hundred pages or so, there is a flash of his former skill, which only makes the book more disappointing 
 This book takes the position that increasing technological infrastructure and investing in higher information technology does not increase productivity. The argument is complete hokum from beginning to end; however, it is very convincing due to the large amount of evidence presented and the prestige of the pseudoscientist promulgating it.   Most of the evidence presented exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which should be obvious to any logician or scientist reading it. However, several more subtle fallacies are also present. The subtlety comes in by virtue of the author failing to define `productivity.'  First, the author measures productivity using GDP. This is analogous to using the physics definition of work when you ask a man who's spent all day trying to tip over a mountain, "Why are you so tired? The mountain hasn't moved, therefore you haven't done any work!" GDP is a measure of output in terms of dollars. It does not measure work done, just how much was sold.   Second, the author uses return on assets to analyze investments in new equipment. Now, I'm no expert in finance, but since assets is in the denominator, using ROA in the way this author does (the ROA of the firm, not the investment decision) would systematically understate the positive effects of these investments. Net Present Value or Internal Rate of Return would both be much better measures.  Third, and this is related to the second point, the author compares firms to what they were in the past (before investing in technology) or to other, dissimilar firms. The relevant comparison is between a firm's current profitability and what the current profitability would have been if not for the investment. The common form of this reasoning is: XYZ Corp. made a huge technological investment in 1986, and experienced no rise in productivity (as measured by ROA). This ignores the possibility that the whole industry became more competitive, and failing to invest in the technology could have led to bankruptcy.   In a related issue, he completely ignores rising standards. His argument is equivalent to, Finding Nemo did not make significantly more money than The Lion King. Therefore, enhanced technology did not increase productivity. This is incorrect because productivity is a measure of work done over time, not money made. If animators tried to make a film with the graphics quality of Finding Nemo by hand, it would have taken several orders of magnitude longer, if it was even possible! The fact is, the animators, like so many workers in society, get far more done today than they used to, they just don't get paid anymore to do it, which is actually an argument for the value of technology.  I gave up on it shortly thereafter 
 Sandra Lee has a penchant for taking someone else's recipe and changing one thing -- or sometimes not changing anything at all -- giving it a new name and trying to pass it off as her own.  This book, like her previous books is made up of 70% recipes available for free from Kraft, Campbells, Betty Crocker and the other food manufacturers she endorses.  It's really no wonder that her "cooking" show was cancelled.  Her book is no better 
 TODAYS MUSICALS, SOMEHOW, AREN'T EQUAL TO THOSE OF YEARS GONE BY. A GOOD STORY TO GO WITH THE MUSIC 
 I've been following the Alex Cross series from its beginning, and after reading Cat & Mouse, I'm wondering if Patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go... Given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more Cross books written subsequently to this one, I can only hope that the series gets better.  My complains are similar to those of other reviewers:  1. I'm getting sick of the perfection of Alex Cross.  The man's a saintly father, saintly grandson, saintly lover, saintly charity worker, and saintly detective.  These traits hooked the reader and made Cross an intriguing character, but he's fast becoming too one-dimensional.  2. The Cross/Sampson relationship.  As if we weren't sick enough of this already.  Every few chapters, we're reminded of the man-crush Cross and Sampson have on each other.  Sampson is so perfect in Cross's eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time Sampson enters a scene.  3. The Cross/Christine Johnson relationship moves WAY too fast.  One moment Christine is still mourning the loss of her husband (who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in Jack & Jill) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date, and the next she and Cross are madly in love.  No development whatsoever, no line from Point A to Point B.  4. I'm not sure Patterson could have written the dialogue between Cross and his children any more unrealistically.  Aren't these 7- and 9-year-old children?  He has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with Sampson or Kyle Craig.  5. The entire novel is a series of pseudo-climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field.  The Soneji resolution was anti-climactic at best, and the Mr. Smith conclusion was unfulfilling 
 My husband bought this book and its companion, If He Only Knew, since we need to work on strengthening our marriange.  I was glad that he took the initiative and was eager to read the book, but I found myself a bit disappointed by the content.  While the basic concepts seem good, I found the examples and suggestions to be rather outdated.  It was originally published in 1979, and, despite some revisions, seems to belong to a different time -- that of 25 years ago.  The book seems to lean too much toward the idea of the wife being submissive to her husband, and encourages her to look nice and greet him with a smile when he comes home from work, which sounds very much like the Home Economics textbooks from the 1950s.  I feel that the author's suggestions do not really speak to me in today's world 
 I am a fan of Oscar Wilde and of BBC productions, but to make Wilde's plays and stories boring takes either special effort, or decided lack of effort.  I've bought this dvd but it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.  The stagy and low-budget sets are to be expected from older BBC tv productions; the costumes are very nice. Sound and picture qualities are excellent.  The actors are mostly very good especially Susan Hampshire and Jeremy Brett in "Ideal Husband", who each provide provide sorely-needed beauty,youth, and especially, energy. (The overaged Mrs Cheavely acts well, but is miscast).  But the pacing and direction of each production is so dull, that I found myself just wanting these to end quickly.  The "Earnest" is so slow and boring as to be the most unwatchable of the group, and that should be a criminal offense 
 The first part of the story was really well put together. I was excited to learn about a man's take on abortion and how he deals with unwanted children, etc. Camille was interesting to read about from the male perspective. But then when she disappeared, the story went downhill, like the poetry. Whew, I didn't like one poem in the whole book and dropped my head every time I had to read another one. I lost so much respect for the character when his white buddy got beat up, but it was even WORSE when he didn't even stand up to his friend. I'm supposed to sympathesize with this cat, who was supposedly so gangsta when he was younger, who's as soft as a pillow now. On top of that, characters (especially his friends) were introduced but had no depth. But then they did amazingly wild things and I was supposed to be shocked, but instead it was like watching it on the news. I didn't really know these characters towards the end, so to find out that they were doing these things was just like "So what?" instead of "He did that? Oh! I don't believe this!" Jenoyne was kinda thrown into the plot and I still don't really know who she was besides religious and having wavy hair and light skin. The first part was five stars, the last part was no stars...this book felt like a rush job 
 Pretty predictable and dull. I found it hard to feel for Huard because he had a bad attitude. If you can't take orders, you do not belong in the armed forces. I liked his roommate "Arkansas" Nance better because he had heart. Still, none of the characters or the plot grabbed my attention 
 I cannot believe I was recomended this because I rated Love's Enduring Promise (which is decent, moral, Christian movie). I read only part of the first customer reveiw, and it sounds really, really sick. Amazon.com: take a clue. I appreciate your services, and I expect that you won't try to sell me anything else of this type. Zero stars. I would not reccomend this to anyone 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I can overlook poor plotting if the characters are three dimensional or I am made to care about them in some way; I can overlook poorly drawn characters if the plot is really well done.  But what I cannot abide is if a book does neither of these things well at all.  And where were the editors on this one?  There were so many run-on sentences I wanted to scream.  I cannot believe that this woman's books are so popular.  I read a lot of books--and this was the worst example of cheap writing I have ever seen.  Don't waste your money!  If I'd been able to leave a rating of less than one star, I would have 
 How can I review the movie "Second Chorus" when I have never received it 
 This book is awful.  The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story.  There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit. 
 Before Darren Aronofsky turned "The Fountain" into a beautiful movie, this exquisite story of life, death and love was made into a graphic novel. But the graphic novel is a stumbling experience, whose beautiful dialogue and heartrending situations are   The story follows three intertwined storylines -- a conquistador named Tomas, who is battling the Mayans, and thinking of Queen Isabella back in Spain. Then there's a doctor named Tom in the present, who is struggling to save his dying wife from a brain tumor, by using an extract from a strange tree.   But death cannot be pushed away, and Izzy succumbs to her cancer -- but Tom won't accept it. It the future, Tom is transporting the tree to a distant nebula, struggling to defeat death once and for all. But is death an end, "nothing"? Or will he fulfil Izzy's last request and finish her book about Tomas the conquistador, and the Tree of Life?   It's an exquisite story, full of moving emotion and mystical connections -- everything from Christianity's story of the tree of good and evil to Mayan myths show up in Tom's journey. This is illustrated through the rings in each story -- tattooed, gifted and wedding -- and the eerie, surreally beautiful climax.   And Aronofsky tackles the ultimate question of life -- is death an end, or a beginning? Does the existance of death give us greater life? And can love reach out beyond the grave?   Unfortunately, Kent Williams' artwork simply doesn't measure up to the exquisite storyline. It feels like a bunch of your basic graphic artists were collaborating in their different styles, only to hit a deadline and turn in the unfinished work. He captures delicate moments -- such as Tomas kissing Isabella's ring -- but the rest of the time, I felt it lacked.   Sometimes there's no background, just aqua splashes or colorless sketched figures. Some of the characters look like photographs cut-and-pasted, and with tacky surroundings merely added in, while at other times they are fully sketched and detailed. And worst of all, it's hard to follow the story because the characters never look the same. Every few pages, they change appearance radically -- Izzy even changes ethnicity for a few panels.   "The Fountain" has a brilliant story, but Kent Williams wasn't up to the task of bringing Darren Aronofsky's beautiful story to life. Too bad, because the story itself is full of bittersweet purity 
 PEST CONTROL was my first book by Mr. Fitzhugh and 30 pages into it I decided it will probably be my last.  The plot outline--ordinary Joe too fixated on his entomological obsession to notice he's been accidentally mistaken for an international assassin--is an ingeniously set stage ripe for grand comedy.  Alas, the curtain never rises above knee level.  The central events & conversations which must create the grand illusion on which the story hinges are unimaginative, unconvincing, and alas, not very funny.  The story goes from there into an adolescent action slapstick, full of too many hastily-created throwaway characters that mostly showcase the author's lack of descriptive power.  If ever a story cried out for an editor this it it.  His awful similes ("Their hearts were harder than trying to open an oyster with a wet bus ticket.") only look good compared to the juvenile imagination which chases the increasingly implausible plot into an oddly tedious crescendo of casual New York slaughter.  The final resolution tries to leap too many logical potholes to survive the crossing into epilogue intact.  The utter unreality of Fitzhugh's cartoonish world could have been a comedic asset if it were consistent, but it doesn't just migrate as the pages wear on, it gallops away, leaving this reader wondering by the end why he didn't quit on page 30 
 This book is the worst hyped-up book I've ever bought.  A total waste of money.  There are NO progam rankings!  Sure, they rank cheapest colleges and the acceptance rates of colleges, but let's face it, the most important factor is choosing a college for its paticular program in which you, the student, will major in.  You can get all of the other information on each of the college websites.  The only reason to buy this book is to warm the fire through the winter season, or maybe to help level a very un-even table 
 The subject is not definetely boring but this book is. Why? the relation of events are handled poorly, daily life is not written, the place of France in Europe in terms of political status or economical status is not written. It is like a reference book giving the dates and people names, who married to whom, who administered what part of country. This is definetely not history. I am still looking for a good book on France's history 
 Don't buy this book.  Unfortunately I did.  This book is at best an       amateurish attempt at writing.  It is simplistic in plot with little to no character development.  Poe is probably turning over in his grave at the cheap references to his literature to promote blood and gore without complementing his ability to develop and build suspense into his works.  I bought this book based on the rating and review published in the Denver, CO "Rocky Mountain News."   Mystery readers--stay with P.D.James or Dan Brown 
 This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat.  They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time.  If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
 I typed in the ISBN of my text book SOM which is one of my most favorite books in the world.  I found the electronic version and bought it immediately as I will be taking a course on the Roots of Science of Mind and wanted an electronic as well as hard copy version.  Unfortunately, the electronic version is NOT the full text.  It does not even follow the full text version.  I was very disappointed and am still searching for the complete electronic version 
 I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school. 
 "Theory in Landscape Architecture" is a compilation of essays, articles, and book excerpts from numerous authors spanning a period of more than fifty years. It seems as if Swaffield went out of his way to include only the driest, most boring, esoteric, and inane essays to include in this book. Nearly all of them are incredibly difficult to read. Many of them are so abstract that it is nearly impossible to discern what the author is trying to say.   Writing is a form of communication, and if your readers can't even figure out what you're saying, you are not communicating well. In that sense, this book is an excellent example of what happens when a bunch of very intelligent, talented people with dismal communication skills sit down in front of a typewriter or computer and try to explain what's on their minds. In short, this book is an ordeal to read 
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
 What a disappointment!  Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book.  Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins.  Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning).  Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified.  Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate "Pefection" with "Conformity" and condemning it as inauthentic.  I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being "boring".  Unfortunately, to claim that "[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen" just doesn't follow.  This is not deep reading.  20 minutes?  Don't waste your time.    
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 I was optimistic given everyone's positive comments and since I am, myself, in the process of designing a project management center of excellence, I took a risk and bought it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it at my local bookstore to flip through it first and now I know why, nobody would buy it if they could see it first. The material is appropriate only at the most basic level of project management capabilities. If you've been at it for only a year or two, you might find it helpful, but if you are truly implementing one (as the title claims), you better already know all this stuff and a whole lot more. I wasted my money, don't waste yours. This is my first review and I don't usually write them but this purchase disappointed me 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 Words cannot describe how disgusted I am by this book. It takes everything we know to be fact and spits and tramples all over it.   This book is the exact equivalent of the same kind of garbage that was spewed by 19th century racist "scholars" like Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Oswald Mosley, and John Burgess. Just as they argued for white supremacy, so too does George James argue for the opposite. Nothing ever changes it seems; millions of people have to suffer and die because of racist ideologies, and yet people never truly learn the dangers of such a sickening worldview.  First of all, I'm not against people re-analyzing history. All historians will often look back at their work, or the work of someone else which may have become antiquated over the years. New ancient works may be discovered which challenge the viewpoints which we may have held as fact for decades. This is good. It allows us to get a more accurate view of the ancient world so as to learn from it. This is different from revisionist history, where the thesis is largely debated among historians. Unfortunately, and it's sad to say, this book doesn't even qualify under revisionist history; it's full of malignant lies. For those who haven't read it, here's a summary:  James argues that Egyptian civilization was black. Fair enough; if that's his argument, he must have proof, right? Well, not quite. DNA testing which has recently been done on mummified corpses (by scientists from ALL races, mind you) shows that they contained traces of Nordic, Semitic, and Persian, among many others. This was seen for both the Pharaohs and the lower class corpses. By my calculation, this means two things; either A) There is a worldwide conspiracy among all scientists involved to hide their true findings and simply make stuff up in order to fill their own agenda, or, more likely, B) James hasn't a clue what he's talking about. According to James, everyone in Egypt was black...except for the hundreds of people whose DNA indicates they were not. But hey, I guess it's possible for two entirely black people to have a Semitic/Persian/Nordic child.   It gets worse. Did you know that the Greeks were simply crooks who stole all of their ideas from the Egyptians? That's right, the Greeks didn't invent anything, it was all stolen! James has proof too: Aristotle travelled to Egypt, where he visited the Library of Alexandria and stole all of the knowledge from the Egyptians. Ouch, that's pretty rough isn't it? That's enough proof to put the nail in the coffin of Greek learning. There's just one problem; it's not true. Aristotle died in 322 BC. The Library of Alexandria was built by Ptolemy II Philadelphos, who ruled from 281 BC to 246 BC. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be pretty difficult for Aristotle to steal ideas from a Library which was built over 40 years after his death. But hey, in Mr. James' book the dead not only rise again, but also steal ideas and formulate complex thought patterns in only a short matter of time.   "The term Greek philosophy, to begin with, is a misnomer, for there is no such philosophy in existence." This is what he writes early in the book. I don't even know how to refute this argument, if one could call it such. James believes that Greeks stole their ideas from Egypt. Philosophy, science, all of it. To be fair, this belief could be possible. The Greeks were definitely influenced by the Egyptians; only a liar would deny that. But here's what I don't understand. How is it that after the Egyptians had their ideas stolen from them, they don't make a single mention of these philosophical ideas? The Egyptians were notorious for how well they recorded their achievements, yet not a single papyrus scroll, engraving, or work of art mentions anything about philosophy. This leads me to believe that either, A) The Greeks stole the Egyptian's ideas, and then Egypt suffered an epidemic of amnesia whereby everyone forgot that they ever had these ideas, or B) James is full of it. Imagine, if you will, that you and a friend are writing an essay on the same topic. Your friend comes over and, while you're unaware, steals your paper and hands it in before you. Now, instead of reporting him for what he's done, you completely forget that you ever wrote a paper, and cheerfully go about your life as if nothing happened. Sounds ridiculous, right? Yet this is the exact type of logic James uses in his book, where it is just as laughable.  I just don't understand what the point of this book is. That blacks are better than whites? Even if that were true, what does the author propose? That we discard all of Greek and Roman history because it's stolen? That schools should only teach history about black people? James never actually discusses why he wrote this book.  However, what sickens me most about this book is that it completely ignores the fact that Africa actually extends BELOW just Egypt and Nubia, and that marvellous civilizations have existed there since long before these two. African civilization is largely unknown because the tribes in sub-Saharan Africa to a large extent relied on oral tradition. There tribes did not have a Livy, Polybius, Thucydides, or Tacitus to record their achievements with a fair degree of accuracy. It is sad to say, but what is today known as sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time garnered an atrocious press. Racist ideologues called them savages and barbarians, simply because their civilization differed from theirs, and sadly, this view has stuck in many places around the world. Indeed, the truth is that Africans have a lot to be proud of, just as Europeans and Asians do. Men like George James do nothing but cause even more hatred when it is not needed. 
 Some artists slowly insinuate themselves into your psyche, requiring repeated listenings while their songs to percolate around in your brain.  Not so Amanda Marshall.  Her songs and her vocals, abetted by big label production, come out swingin' for the fence.  Her voice has the flexibility to go from soulful shouting to soulful warbling.  Her lyrics are just as forthright.  For my taste, it's all a bit too strident, too 'out front'.  I prefer the artists that hold something back, that don't tell you everything, the ones that leave some mystery that compels you to play the songs again.  Marshall has more immediate appeal, but one that wears thin sooner 
 I have been interested in improving my performance for years, and finally decided to take the plunge and look into heart-rate monitoring. This book does not really support a specific philosophy and who knows if the so called "science" is supportable. I also read "Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot" by John L. Parker and recommend it. It appears much more scientific and emphasizes recovery over training in a zone. Don't buy this book.  Rory Donaldson roryd@brainsarefun.co 
 After watching Mr. Feinberg being interviewed on television I was most anxious to read his book. It goes without saying that the topic is both fascinating and poignant. However, given that the author is extremely distinguished I was perplexed as to why he felt the need to continually bombard the reader with his credentials. I felt quite bogged down with his repeated self-aggrandizing and was rather turned off. He came across as very caring and obviously intelligent during the television interview so I can only conclude he communicates better orally than in written word 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 Try to call Panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first. Panasonic service is the worst one in this world. 
 I loved the fact that you can program your fitness segments, but this tape should be labeled just for beginners.  The toning segments didn't fatigue my muscles, and the cardio I barely broke a sweat. If you are a beginner, this is a great video to start with.  They only do 6 reps for weights most of the time and the cardio is not too hard to follow, or too hard to do.   In all 5 stars for beginners, 2 stars for intermediate/advanced. 
 This is not a review, but a warning. Browsing for copies of Darwin's journal of his voyage on the Beagle, I read the reviews below. I would point out that McEvilly says that this book is unabridged; Cliffe says it is abridged.  The Penguin USA web site doesn't say which it is, but the Penguin UK site says that the text of this edition has been shortened.  So if you're looking for the full text, this doesn't appear to be it.   
 Entertaining but not in the same league as Star Trek, the new BattleStar Galactica, Buffy, or Roswell. Never explained why every alien they meet speaks English, especially as language barriers were important in the original movie. Some of the acting is wooden, especially Teal'C and Carter. However, Jackson, O'Neil and Hammond are well-acted characters. The plot lines do not bear a lot of scrutiny 
 This is a fragment of a book.  While it is well written, has good characters and some very interesting concepts, it fails for lack of a plot.  The story seems to stop right when it should just be getting interesting.  This is a pity since everything else was in place to make it a truly good book.  I was very frustrated and disappointed.     
 This movie had a halfway decent set up and good acting, but the storyline deteriorated as the secrets were revealed and the ending made no sense. That's 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back, honestly my time would have been better spent sitting in an empty room staring off into space, at least then I could pass it off as meditating. 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 I might have been expecting too much, but I was disappointed with this book. I did not learn anything on Dark Magick per se. The first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, Goths, Vampires, Lost Souls, the Collective Unconscious, Dark Deities, Satanism and some other stuff. The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick 
 The book seems to be well written, however one reason I purchase computer books is to go through the examples and actually get the source code to compile. There's an unanswered enty in the Apress forum from July asking if anyone could get the source to compile. As I said it's not answered so apparently no one else could get the source to compile either. As I said in the forum if authors would simply include a jar file with the source this problem would not exist. Since the author used eclipse to generate the examples and since it's a simple mouse click in eclipse to do this, it must be laziness on the authors part. I'll change my rating once (if) the source code compiles 
 We were very disappointed - it seems that a considerable amount was left out, whar happened? The TV series included considerable more than was in that set of DVD's. We saw them a couple of weeks ago and are still quite angry! 
 On Right Where You Want Me, teen pop star Jesse McCartney attempts to extend his fifteen minutes with a stab at rock maturity. Basically, this involves nicking Maroon 5's style and running with it. Unfortunately, the album's sound is dated and has been for some time.  The title track (and first single) will probably be a deserved semi-hit. It's the most immediate thing on the album and fits McCartney's thin, nasal voice. In fact, much of the album is full of retreads of the first song, though all are inferior. Worst of all are Right Back In The Water and Tell Her, or as I like to call them, Droopy Ballad #1 and Droopy Ballad #2. Neither of these songs have the bombast or vulnerability that superior teenage ballads exhibit. Better is Invincible, which tells the story of a fatal drinking-and-driving accident. Lyrically it's obvious, but at least McCartney seems to feel it. Less successful are Can't Let You Go and We Can Go Anywhere, a pair of atrociously detached rockers.   Jesse McCartney is better suited to Radio Disney fair. After all, Beautiful Soul and Because You Live (both off his major label debut) were legit, catchy pop hits. While they were undeniably bubblegum, they were also fun and urgent. Right Where You Want Me is neither. Instead it's a long, arduous collection of factory-pressed wannabe-rock that feels hollow and forgettable.  Key Tracks: Right Where You Want Me, Feelin' You, Invincibl 
 I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good 
 Reading this book, I had already seen Revenge of the Sith as well as the Clone Wars Cartoon Network series that led up to Revenge of the Sith and I must say, to see a book come in and present its own version of the attack on Coruscant was disappointing.  While I'm sure there are enough fans out there who haven't watched the Clone Wars, there are probably more that have and it changed a lot of the storylines used for the last moments before the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  While I'm not saying the Clone Wars version of the attack on Coruscant is the only real version of the story, the book could have redeemed itself but explaining things that readers who had not seen the Clone Wars would be wondering.  For example, in Revenge of the Sith, the first time you see General Grievous, he is coughing and wheezing badly.  Without seeing the Clone Wars, you would not know why.  The book also gives no explanation as to why.  Finally, the political undertones that permeate this book are sickening.  This is supposed to be the Stars Wars universe not the current US Presidency/Congress plotlines set in the Star Wars universe.  All in all, as much of a fan of the Star Wars movies and books, this is by far my least favorite book I have read in the series and I will not be in any rush to read it again.  
 The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her.  She remains the "good girl" and subsumes  her anger into a semantic term "fierce" compassion.  The title of  the book is rather "nice girl forgives once again".  Except now  she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no  longer need to be silent provided we forgive.  And since we are not  compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than  laugh at our own anger.  What's so fierce or compassionate about that 
 I am an avid reader and I love British "cozies".  That said, I could barely make myself finish this book.  The characters are not interesting, I got tired of hearing how "beautiful" the main character is and the mystery was uninspired.  
 Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album.  Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good.  In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album.  Now to this album, "the new one".  You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album.  What the hell was going on?  Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song?  Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it.  Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!!  Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD 
 Despite the hype of the title this book has two main themes both of which never offer a single specific example of lean application on a software development effort. It is highly surprising that this book received a Shingo award for application of lean technologies to software development because the best this book has to offer is recommendations and cheerleading for how lean ought to be applied - no practical examples are ever offered leading one to feel as if they have been cheated after such a bold assertion made by the title.  In general the book is a compilation (vice application) of two main concepts - 1.) lean approaches and recommendations on how to apply these to software and 2.) one of the author's experiences from the 382J and C27J programs. Notice that these two main themes never successfully integrate into a single tenet on application of lean processes to software.  The author's experiences from the previous two programs (382J and C27J) are in fact applications of techniques that have been around since at least the mid 80s - SCR (Software Cost Reduction - D. Parnas) and the use of Spark Ada (subset of Ada used in safety critical applications with formal "annotations").   The SCR approach is based on specifying the software behavior precisely and concisely through conditions, events, modes, and terms. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of organizations in both industry and government used the SCR techniques to document the requirements of a wide range of systems. In 1994, a version of SCR called CoRE was used to document the requirements of Lockheed's C-130J aircraft. The C-130J requirements document contained over 1000 tables and the resultant code was about 250 K SLOC. The use of SCR is not a new technology, neither is it necessarily lean. However, it is important to understand that tools exist that can interrogate SCR tables and provide an indication of the quality of the specification in terms of completeness, consistency and a few can even generate test vectors that could be used to test the tables in a test environment.   Spark Ada is a subset of either the Ada 83 or Ada 95 language versions where annotations are used to specify assertions made about the software. These assertions are made about the data relationships (information flow), various properties that either need to hold when a subprogram is called (preconditions), or that will hold once execution of the subprogram has completed (postconditions). The Examiner is then run on the specification and corresponding body of a subprogram and will analyze the body of the subprogram to build up a model of the information flow. This model is then compared against that which has been specified by the annotations and any discrepancies reported to the user. This method places emphasis on the completeness of the software largely through the information flow as modeled above. The argument is that given a good enough series of pre-conditions, post-conditions and information flow arguments the software is then "proven" to be formally correct. Practitioners who do not hold these notions argue that the "proof" is only as good as the degree of effort employed in specifying these assertions.  It was widely understood among certain circles that the C130-J team that cut their teeth on these techniques (read as huge cost overrun and over one year late) was made available for the 382J development and the real software lean story was the use of the small now experienced team (as Brooks argued) on that effort more than any application of lean technologies.  This book addresses lean terms such as flow, value, pull, etc but fails to demonstrate any tangible use of them or even specific recommendation for how they might apply to software life cycle activities.  The book spends a chapter maligning the CMM practice in which nothing good about it is said. I agree with the author's concerns about the organizational inertia created by this initiative and the lack of focus that this approach tends to put on the bottom line - developing software productively. I also tend to disagree with the author in his assertion that nothing useful can come from the CMM. It would be very disappointing to see any CMM practitioner that uses quantitative management and does not address defect prevention and cost - making the necessary trade-offs between these two to achieve a cost balanced solution. I also tend to think that the CMM has addressed key areas that tend to bring needed areas of focus such as tracking of progress and creating the disciplined structure in bringing together a comprehensive software engineering management framework for development of software.   Overall, this book falls very short of its bold title and is in my opinion not worth reading. Again, disappointing performance for something selected as a Shingo award recipient 
 I was excited about this cd...then I started listening to it. If I wanted Beastie Boys I would have bought Beastie Boys. Its nothing but lame 80's rap loops and a few butt rock tracks. Nothing like the Bloodhound gang of old. What happened to the techno/pop? What happened to somewhat punk? The only good song on the cd is Kids incorporated. I would consider this their joke cd since about half of the tracks are garbage and only 40 seconds long. One word...lame 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 Let me rant. This CD has 2 albums on it. 1 is mono and the other stereo!? I have these albums on records and they are both stereo. I feel ripped off. Also, these albums do not sound anywhere like the records in quality. In fact, they sound very boring and lacking of any sort of life. Judy did very big, exciting production numbers and the sound on this CD makes them sound stale and dead. I returned this CD and demanded my money back. The store clerk said I wasn't the only one. Thumbs way down 
 i love doolittle surfer rose and come on pilgrim bossanova is an good album but not as great as the two mentioned but this my friends is appalling god could they make much more un-inspired noise i kno that's the trait of the pixies but for gods sake just a few guitars being plucked badly and frank black screeching with his balls in his throat god...no thanks there is one song i like plant of sound great riff the only great song  all the rest are noise  get the albums mentioned above then a frank black solo album before this good point 
 If you are interested in how food fits in with your life's purpose, then this book might be for you. This book suggests that you should "be mindful more not of the body for the body's sake, but of the body that the temple of the living God may be the better channel for manifesting the spritual truths." Many foods are mentioned regarding their inclusion or exclusion in your diet, but you're expected to take it all on faith since the book does not reference any studies, scientific or otherwise. The book also recommends to avoid microwave ovens for cooking but mentions no reason! Conventional ovens are OK. It also suggests you never eat raw apples. Basically, it's a bunch of advice on how to eat and live without any scientific backing. If you want modern advice backed by science, then try something else like Superfoods RX 
 Another product of Hollywood's "Karaoke Culture".  In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in "U-571" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of "Das Boot".  But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it 
 After crashing two hard disks the same day for no reason, I lost all my confidence in this company. The sad part I lost my back up of huge file cache. All my MP3s, pictures, documents, legal docs etc.  I bought seagate and Fantom drives. I am happy now 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 The movie was only 90 minutes, but at least 20 of those were flash backs from the first one. The hillbilly cannibals are all of a sudden hillbilly cannibals on motorbikes. And NO ONE dies until the last 20 minutes. Need I say more 
 Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters 
 Disappointing to say the least.  Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son.  I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.  There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book.  Save your money and go straight to book 3 
 I have to rate this at 1 star for the time being since pages 179-242 are missing.  Instead I have two sets of pages 243 - 306.  
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 I purchased this book as a gift for my 22 year old son based upon the glowing reviews I read on-line. It was my goal to educate my son in regards to health and fitness, as well as nutrition. Upon the arrival of this book, I found it to have a disgusting approval and promotion of the homosexual lifestyle. While I don't mind what others do in their private time, I do not want to advocate and show my son intimate details of what this lifestyle entails. I advise all parents to be very careful reading the reviews as they certainly are not on the "up and up" and often have a different agenda than what you may expect 
 The plot seemed forced, contrived and just plain ridiculous.  The beginning of the book focuses a lot on the twin boys, relying on the "cute factor" but then they just disappear for the rest of the book.  Thin and unsuspenseful story line.  Romantic relationship not up to par with other Linda Howard books.  I feel cheated - was really looking forward to another satisfying LH book.  Oh well, maybe next time 
 Wow this book really stinks.  I can't believe people get paid to write this stuff.  If I didn't have to read this book for school I would have burned it after the first few pages 
 First of all, I don't think that this item deserves to be called a book, because this less-than-one-hour-reading is more like a pamphlet, with 25 ideas meant to help you to become better at fundraising. The problem is that these ideas are not new and most of them have been used by anyone, except for two or three of these which seemed a bit more interesting. Apart from that, it is 90% directed to political campaigns and it's almost completely useless for any charity or non-profit organization. Generally, these ideas are not very useful anyway and all these positive reviews here really make me think that they've been written either by the authors themselves or by someone who actually has no clue about fundraising at all. I consider that this "book"'s price is too high for what you get, so you better keep looking for something better and more substantial 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 I was anticipating this book for a while.  I am a big fan of the DCU and of Green Lantern who is one of my favorite DC superheroes.  I read Green Lantern including the transition to Kyle Rayner as Green Lantern.  With that said, I am very disappointed in this novel and the concepts that it introduced.  Mr. O'Neil is a better writer than this and I am disappointed in him as well.  I was so moved (negatively) by this book that I felt I should write a review.  Like I said, I know the story about Hal Jordan and Coast City and Parallax and the eventual handing of the Power Ring to Kyle Rayner.  I have no problem when a writer massages an origin or two to make the story work.  But this felt like he took what I knew of the Justice League and it's core and Green Lantern and the Oans and put them all into a food processor.  What we got out of it looked like chunky green pea sludge.  I won't pass all the details of the story along but I felt like the author took established events in the DCU and made them into bland, trivial entries to justify the telling of his story.  The origin of the Justice League, the characterization of it's members, the use of Hal Jordan and "Di", the misrepresentation of the Oans and the Green Lantern Corps were a big pile of steaming ____.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the author was thinking.  Gross misrepresentation simply doesn't fit into story.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, the Kyle Rayner we see here is a whiner.  If I heard the story he told in this novel, I'd strip him of the ring and give it to someone else.  The idea that only humans have artistic concepts which is why Kyle can do so well ... crap.  And Gandy?  Please.  Ganthet was a pretty key Oan in the scheme of things with the Guardians.  The author reduced him to a cardboard cutout with Ganthet's likeness.  I just find the novel contrived and ill-thought.  If I was the author's editor and knew a quarter of what I know about the Green Lantern and his history, I would have told Mr. O'Neil to go back to the drawing board.  There were a few concepts that I had to agree with.  Some of what Kyle had to do to train.  Yes, good ideas.  The idea that the Oans have lost touch with other sentient beings.  Again, I have to agree with that.  And the portrayal of Batman, was right on.  But Kyle sleepwalking (not literally) through a third of the novel and the misrepresentation of Hal Jordan and the Oans left me ill by the end.  If this was an assignment that was turned in for a grade, I'd give it an 'F' just in the poor manner that the story was told.  Even worse knowing the history of the characters that star in it.  Mr. O'Neil, I'm disappointed in you.  You should never have turned in this story 
 The book is TEDIOUS. A few mediocre yarns and lots of detail about Irish horseracing last year and before. Lots of old, once-charming Irish cliches repeated and repeated. Too many names, too much trivial detail about weather, horses and people you don't need to know. I'm a horse owner and interested in racing. I was bored after 50 pages, but battled on for awhile. Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.  This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece. Barich is a good writer, but this book is destined for the remainder table - and soon. It is a chore to read it. I think two stars is generous.   
 This is truly an execrable book, and Barron's should be ashamed to have published it. Not only is it poorly written and misleading in some of its conclusions, it is riddled with factual errors. Some of these errors may be blamed on the confusing charts (ex: the chart on page 22 seems to indicate that the Hopi and Navajo lived in New England while the Chinook inhabited Texas and the Pequot, Mohegan, and Naragansett hung out in Florida), while others are relatively minor (ex: page 44, the lawyer in the John Peter Zenger trial was Andrew Hamilton, not Alexander Hamilton).  Other "errors" can be described more accurately as "glaring misunderstandings and lapses of historical fact." My favorite of these occurs on pages 120 and 121, when the author goes on at length about how John Brown's experiences "as a slave" led him to organize the attack on the federal armory at Harper's Ferry. There is a little box with a quote from the memoirs of a Georgia slave named John Brown talking about the harsh conditions of his life before his escape. This is immediately followed by this paragraph:  "John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry proved to be a catlyst for war. He was arrested, tried and hanged. When you look at the diary entry, you will see the agony that Brown went through as a slave. It is not surprising that when he escaped, he decided to lead the attack. You must take this suffering into account in deciding what you would have done if you were John Brown."  Of course, John Brown was not a slave. He was a white abolitionist/violent revolutionary. Amazingly enough, there must have been more than one person named John Brown living in America in the 1850s!  It really is amazing to me that Barron's, which I have generally found to be a reputable company, would let such a book carry the Barron's name into the market. I have the 1999 edition, and it is my fervent hope that there are no subsequent editions. If there are, I hope that someone has gotten around to editing the thing.   The only way I could possibly recommend this book is if it were to a bored history teacher who wanted to exercise his or her red pen a little.   
 A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.  Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available 
 My husband bought this for our son a few weeks ago. My son loves the toy but its cheap and flimsy. The Superman figure is split on the side after just one day of playing with it and this keeps it from filling up with air and launching. Not that it matters b/c the launch button never seemed to work anyway. it would either not push down or you would push it down and superman would just barely lift off. don't waste your money 
 This is NOT the restored print of Dracula 1931 that Universal previously released on DVD a few years earlier.If you have that DVD keep it as the quality on this box set is awful.I can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this didn't bother to look or didn't know that Universal had a fully restored copy of this film 
 Although I'm a diehard fan of this great British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be better than nothing, but not by much  I was also disappointed in the extras. The "character biographies" weren't of the characters in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD.   The radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the TV screen. This can lead to screen burning on some sets. 
 I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed. Two of iron broke (yes, broke!) while I was practicing in the range. Its completely worthless and I strongly suggest to stay away from this set 
 First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating 
 Woe is Nickel, professional skeptic and member of "CSICOP" and "The Skeptical Inquirer."  His star Shroud expert is Walter McCrone, a researcher who never looked at the Shroud firsthand. Included within the Shroud of Turin Research Project,  McCrone was sent a collection of stcky tape linen thread samples.  For a firsthand account of McCrones' sandoffish and unprofessional demeanor, please read "Report on The Shroud of Turin" by researcher John Heller.   McCrone found a handful of paint paticles, far too random and sparse to account for the Shroud image.... which is proven to be a dehydration of the topmost linen fibrils. He found many samples of iron oxide particles, but these particles were too "Chemically pure" to be related to any paint pigment. They were found to be the result of "rhetting," involved with the ancient manufacture of linen.   STURP tried to publically confront McCrone regarding his conclusions. The man dodged and weaved like a pro. He avoided direct debate. He even called one reaseracher from STURP...   "an a$$, ... and you can quote me."   Very professional. Very mature.  It's just logical... "it is easier to tear down than to build up." Nickell is a professional "tear down"er,  which is a career choice that is truly "the easy way." Debunk, discredit and cast doubt...  yeah, that's a real challenge for an author... NOT.  For man, doubt comes naturally. To honestly confront any mystery that challenges a naturalistic world view takes courage, a courage few "mainstream" scientists possess. Thank God for the minority!!   Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."      
 The author presents what he thinks is a shocking revelation that (dare I say it?) the Bible may not be literally true and that ministers are lying to their congregations. In answer to him, let me recommend two books, "Affirmations of a Dissenter" by Bishop Joe Sprague and "The Pagan Christ" (subtitled "Is literalism killing Christianity?") by Tom Harpur. Any thinking Christian can tell you that most of what is in the Bible is myth and metaphor, with historical parallels and antecedents going back thousands of years B.C., most strikingly to ancient Egypt, as well as common themes and stories present is other contemporary religions (think Carl Jung's archetypes). This realization and acceptance will lead to a religious pleuralism that can serve to bring the faithful of all religious traditions together, freeing them from endless arguments about divisive and exclusionary little factoids that detract from the moral and social value of their respective teachings, which can only be a good thing. I don't see that the author has added anything to the dialogue 
 This toy is a big disappointment!  It wasn't easy to put together and is certainly NOT durable!  Hard to see how others can make such a claim - don't their kids actually touch the toy?  My son is pretty easy on toys and this set hasn't lasted at all!  He is extremely frustrated at the way it constantly falls apart and is difficult to put back together.  He has no trouble at all with complicated Lego sets - a much better way to spend your money!! 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 The above just about says it.  Very poorly written.  Very naive.  Just another Christian bashing piece of trash writing.  It gives you the idea that a society based on Starhawk's philosophy is untenable. 
 This book is falsified and exaggerated.  The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published.  The Voodoo's also were trying to scare "outsiders" who criticized them away with wild, false stories.  Don't believe everything you read in this book.  It's a hoax 
 I bought this when it first came out,knowing nothing about the chicago mob except the name Al Capone.Even not knowing about Giancana going in I felt there was plenty of nonsense in this book.St.Valentine's Day Massacre?JFK?RFK?Marylin Monroe?Fidel Castro?CIA?You guessed it,Giancana had a hand in all the deaths and controlled the world from his home in Oak Park,Illinois(where he was murdered,by the way).This book is a sham,written by a brother and nephew of Giancana who never let the truth get in the way of the story they tell.If you want a true picture of Giancana's role in the Castro matter,or anything else about him(he was approached by the CIA but never actually did anything except tell Johnny Roselli to string them along),read William Brashler's excellent The Don or William Roemer's Man Against The Mob,two books that have facts,not drivel.Tony Accardo not powerful enough to override a Giancana decision?Guess who had Giancana murdered by Sam's best friend?Accardo,the real boss of Chicago,that's who(not the shadowy govt killer the authors would have you believe) 
 I cant believe that I actually paid for this book. Anyone with a brain knows that if you buy low and sell high, you will make money. If you know that then you dont need this book. This book is silly. I cant believe that it was even printed. 
 After the first 20 pages of the book you will already have heard everything the author has to say, it's all about racism and sexism.  It's good to see someone exposing on the fact that anti-sexist, anti-classist and anti-racist thinking is shaping the way many things are handled, some good points are made in this book but the truth is that once you have read 20 pages you have read the whole book, all it does is blame the same factors on everything and I found myself skimming thru the 3 later chapters trying to find something new to read about, but it just keeps on going on the same thing.  This book may be novel and insightful, but the author lacks the writing skills to put it together into a coherent and readable essay on the subject.  not worth buying, not by a long sho 
 oh baby, this is precious, someone here is actually comparing CMB to The Beatles?!?! Is that why CMB's CD is selling for a whopping 21 cents? I'd love to continue but the urge for uncontrollable laughter is just way too much, ha ha ha ha ha ha......... 
 For twenty years or longer, Martha Grimes has been one of my favorite mystery writers.  Furthermore, in recent years, particularly in her Emma Graham series, she has emerged as an eloquent and graceful wordsmith.  Her ability to create a mood, from sleepy and laid-back to threatening to comical, with a few well-placed impressionistic brush strokes sets her apart from other writers of the genre.  Unfortunately, her emergence as a word stylist has been more than offset by her decline as a constructor of plots.  There is almost enough of a story line here for an economical, 200-page novel.  Almost.  Unfortunately, what we get is nearly 400 pages with no plot resolution; the story merely proceeds to a point and stops.  I assume that Part 2 will be forthcoming -- for another 20 bucks, of course.  Instead of a completed narrative, we're treated to half a story and a whole boatload of filler.  She gives us one too many performances of "Medea: The Musical." It only works once per book, Ms. Grimes!  Ditto the upstairs visits to alcoholic Aunt Aurora; the cab rides with the moronic Delbert; the trips to the diner in Cold Flat Junction, the musings on what lies beyond the line of trees at the horizon; the put-downs of Ree-Jane; the sabotaging of Miss Bertha's meals; and on and on and on. I often found myself thinking, "Not another one!"  Since Ms. Grimes' latest Richard Jury novel, The Old Wine Shades, suffers from the same defects as Belle Ruin -- no plot resolution and reams of marginally relevant filler -- I conclude that she has made some sort of deal with the devil to serialize her novels.  Furthermore, the multiple editing errors that other reviewers have noted indicate the same thing - that Ms. Grimes is now cranking out her books assembly-line style, a la Tom Clancy.  What a shame.  What a loss 
 In case anyone else is looking for it, the song that's playing during the stolen cheer (the one that begins with "Brr, it's cold in here") is The 900 # by The 45 King. It's too bad they left it off the soundtrack 
 i think this CD is a pretty good Cd to listen to. This was my first wwe cd to have. we listened to it all the time. I liked it so much i brought it to school and someone stole it so i can't listen to it anymore. I say 3 stars because it was good not excellent  but not bad. That's my opinion 
 Promising start. A sniper kills people, seemingly randomly. When asked why, he says "God told me to". Other mass murders occur, and the murderers all claim that God told them to do it.   After 25 minutes the mystery slowly starts to unfold. There is a "sect" of middleaged and elderly men who have been gathered telepathically. They know what is going on. UFO:s in the past explain some mysterius births. And "God" turns out to be not too impressive. Why, oh why, did they try to explain it all so stupidly?  The movie is dedicated to the memory of Bernard Herrmann, the famous movie music composer (Vertigo, Psycho and much more), and the music often resembles the intense string music of Herrmann. There is some good choir music too. The acting is good all over. Good pictures. Slow tempo, but not too slow. And the script is good up until one third of the movie. So, what happened? I have three theories:  1. After writing script for the first part of the movie, the script writer died and the story was completed by someone else. (Since only Cohen is credited as writer I guess this theory won't hold up...) 2. They wanted to do a film with some cool music and dedicate it to Bernard Herrmann, so they wrote the music first and then wrote scenes that would fit the music, not minding if the story turned out to be rather strange (and stupid). 3. The script writer had read too much von Dniken ("God is a UFO, just look here in Ezechiel...").   Anyway, here is another example of a movie that has most thing going for it, but lacks a good story to back it up with. And a good story means something. At least, if you try to be clever, like this film does.  This movie is sometimes called "Demon" 
 Nicholson was never bad, he was just in bad movies.  This is one of them.  Nicholson cast as a werewolf was genius and at first sounds very promising.  Nicholson and the great sublte werewolf makeup by the great Rick Baker is where this movie starts and ends.    Whoever did the lighting for this film should never work in Hollywood again. Reminded me of the terrible 'over-lighting' in Alien vs predator and really killed any hint of atmospherics. Even the great Ennio Morricone's score was unremarkable and too slight for the atmospherics required to make a film like this work well.   About 52 minutes into the film the werewolf makes his first appearance.  By that time I was really squirming as Michelle Pfeiffers acting stinks and the poor love story scipt was both unbelieveable and forced. I then lost all hope when  Nicholson leaves the house on the night of the full moon as a werewolf and proceeds to chase a deer through the forest - all of a sudden the shot goes to broad daylight with beaming clear blue skies peering through the forest background.  Unbelieveably inept. This could've been a really effective scene.....    This flick overall has a real made for TV look/feel to it with lots of TV quality acting and many TV familiar stars here too.  The camera work was absolutely lousy, static and stagnant - no composition or creativity to ANY of the shots except maybe for Nicholson howling at the moon atop a large rock and a quick establishing shot of the rafters in the barn near the end - certainly not enough for a two hour film and really reflects poorly on the talent and creativity of both the director and cinematographer.  Did I mention the lighting really stinks all the way thru?     I'm not bagging on this film because it wasn't Chaney's Wolf Wan or because there is barely just one transformation scene, or on account of the simple make up job for the wolf man.  All of those factors served the film well and were completely effective and totally acceptable.  This movie simply fails completely on it's own because of a poor script and lack of atmosphere, I'm telling you, the lighting was HORRIBLE for a film of this type and the camera work was of high school film student quality.    Perhaps their only mistake was their concious decision to stay far away from any of the elements that made Chaney's Wolf Man the atmospheric classic that it was.... 
 Hilts is a journalist so perhaps he can be forgiven for writing such a biased book, although to give him credit, he does not seem to even try to hide his bias, which makes the book a kind of comedy. A much better (and thinner) book on the FDA is written by a former FDA regulator and a M.D., To America's Health, by Henery Miller 
 Truly amazing. Finally a book that captures the essence of disgusting. Words cannot describe the dullness that drifts from the pages of Black Rage, like the smoke from a factory. A thought that could have been condensed into a sentence or two the authors have managed to expand into 200 pages of nothingness.  Though it may have started off as a cute idea, it quickly turned into a nauseating yet boring book. If you enjoyed Black Rage you may also enjoy the encyclopedia, thesaurus, or just sitting in a room for hours doing nothing 
 I ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that I would learn something about Familiars . In the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about Ms Little . Had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an Owl? Had she entertained A Hyrax or a Feral Cat as a house guest ? Had she ever had a pet Bat living behind a picture in the living room ? Was she acquainted with the properties of Henbane and twylight sleep and did she number Hecate among her close friends? The kindest thing , I thought was to suggest that Ms Little Knew as much about Familiars as I know about Conveyancing or Futures Trading , and let it go at that  
 The book delivers what it promises the so-called CEO perspective. Its just a chatty overview, useless for actual risk management at any level. Maybe they should use it as an introductory MBA book for those who have no exposure to finance at all 
 Even though they look pretty cool, these mirrors are hard to focus, and even harder to see anything in 
 I just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great.  But today I tried to turn it on and it's completely dead!  I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).  Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.    Grrrrr!! 
 While I found the actual workout easy to follow and challenging, the diet advice brought me to an unhealthful physical and mental state. The guide suggests 15-20 grams of fat each day, while the FDA recommends 65 grams. For many smaller teens, 15-20 might be ideal. For others, it is a starvation diet. When I followed her advice (I am 15), I started daydreaming about food constantly, my metabolic rate slowed, and I eventually fainted due to malnourishment.     She also does not differentiate between so-called good and bad fats. Avocados and nuts contain good fats (polyunsaturated, monounsaturated,and Omega 3), yet she lists them as unhealthful, lumped into a category with foods that contain saturated and trans (bad) fats. Her autobiographical sketch discloses the source of her nutritional ignorance. She has a PHD, but in what? Probably English, because she claims she was once an English Teacher, and she does not list any actual credentials in the fields of Exercise and Health.   This book presents a significant danger and should be taken off the shelves 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 It would be most gratifying to witness the wise and ancient "Ramtha" answering questions posed by credentialled experts in anthropology, archaeology, and other legitimate scientific fields...after all, "Ramtha" would be a font of valuable information about the location of Atlantis and customs, technology and mores of the world 35,000 years ago...things that could be verified in the field, right? Experts in these fields do know quite a bit about agriculture, clothing, tools, and other aspects of life 35 millenia ago--what a chance for "Ramtha" to contribute to our knowledge!  OR--better yet--why not let "Ramtha" take the "Million Dollar" challenge by the James Randi Educational Foundation? Surely "Ramtha" could breeze through that for all the world to see? Otherwise, one is inclined to believe that anybody could master a little stage training, alter their accent, spout vapid platitudes, and make a fortune off of "channeling"...Hey, maybe I should give "channeling" a try!   
 OK, so I thought I was crazy, not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot. People were making fun of me, "HOW CAN YOU BURN ANYTHING IN A CROCKPOT"?? Now, I look at the reviews on this thing and see that I AM NOT ALONE. I always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot! Now I know that they are not SUPPOSED TO be like this!!! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS THING UNLESS YOU LIKE SCORCHING BURN GUNK!!!!! On the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours!!!!  I am trashing mine today!! 
 Don't get me wrong, South Park is genius comedy. Sitcoms from the 50's through the 80's usually had a moral at the end of each ep. I dare you to find an episode of "The OC" or "Dawson's Creek" or "Prison Break" that has a healthy moral. SP has an intelligently articulated moral at the end of (almost) every single episode. When my kids turn 14, they will be forced to watch all the back episodes.  In other matters: You can pay $155.99 for the 5 season DVD set.  Or you can pay $128.89 and buy seasons 1 through 5 individually.  Somebody at Amazon hasn't been doing their homework.  Price this collection for $99.99 and you'll sell about a billion of them.   Update: It's April 12th, 2006 (2 days after I made the above review) and the prices of the South Park DVD's has changed. Seasons 1 - 5 now go for $29.99 each; $149.95 for all 5. The 5 season collection is $155.99. What do I get for my extra 6 bucks? A fancier box? If you customer buys your product in volume, they usually get a discount, not an upcharge! Duh!   Update: It's Tuesday April 18th. The total price for seasons 1-5 purchased individually on Amazon is $118.85.  The box set is $145. It should be about $100 and I won't buy it until it is. 
 Read the reviews. This is not a photography book. It is a book on psychology. As a photographer I give this 1 star. This may very well be a good psycology book 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 This book gives just a general overview of cat care.  It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info.  I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats 
 This Rugrats movie is the worst of the three. Obviously, it was made for promotion and cash more than anything. Nickelodeon didn't consider the plot in the process, so the movie suffers. The plot is complex, yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously, and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots. The movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp. Since Rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds, they won't get it. The main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [also, Burger King promotion to go with that], and the fact that Spike would now talk. Hah! Spike talked in the episode of the series about Chuckie's dreams. Besides, smelling some disgusting card [that you can smell anytime, not during the movie] isn't fun. The burger smells more like spoiled milk. Anyway, the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dosen't happen. Debbie's well-publicized line and the "That is so wrong!" line, and the Wedgie-dance, are among the stupidest things I have ever seen. Maybe an 8-year-old would disagree. Being 12, I found the humour pretty dumb. So you're aware, I love the series. This movie just wasn't creative at all, it was more of a Thornberry-type flick. And finally, it just isn't whimsical or special in any way. Not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store, if that 
 I have read some past reviews on this book, and i am shocked to find that college students have been using this book for learning. I am currently in high school and my teacher is making us read this book. I find this book very hard to understand. If anyone has any information or quick summaries of this book i would appreciate it. Thanks 
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.   By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it 
 I felt that this book really failed to bring any substantive arguments to the table.  It is replete with British cynicism that ironically reinforces the gap between "high" and "low" culture that it purports to condemn.  The examples he uses to support his claims are frequently taken out of context and ultimately do little to further his arguments.  Simply put, this work reflects poor rhetoric and therefore rides the coat-tails of scienece and cultural anthropology to furnish his points (cultural anthropology, by the way, he presents as science; i.e. - as objective truth.  God knows a cultural scientist brings no subjectivity into the process. *note my sarcasm*).  In the end, I just disagree with him, but should also add, his efforts (which seem to me to be quite derivative) do very little to even move me to consider his theses 
 This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat.  The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader.  If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel.  If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you.  Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written 
 I was quite disappointed with this book, after Pecked to Death by Ducks and A Jaguar is Ripping my Flesh which were truly rip-rollicking great fun 
 Somebody put together curves and equations from other books to make quick money. You will be disapointed. don't buy it  
 Te Celestine Prophecy is the only book I've ever read more than once. I love it. I started the Tenth Insight immediately after finishing the Celestine Prophecy for the second time and I couldnt beleive this was written by the same author. Did something happen to Redfield between writing these 2 books? Most of the first book is very believable and enlightening, but the second is a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and mostly, in my opinion, totally over the top. I found myself skipping page upon page of rambling. Very weird, and a little disappointing really 
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 Somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full-time MBA program.  We complained so much that this was a 1st year 'college level' book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year.  Now I can't resell my 'unused' version on campus.  What a waste 
 I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying. 
 Best suited for supervisory personnel with limited experience and limited education.  Not helpful to experienced managers with some exposure to management theory and interpersonal dynamics.  Too much of a  "recipe" book 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 When this book arrived, it had obviously been handled very poorly during the packaging process. There were smudges and rips all over the cover, detracting from the book's appeal as a coffee table book. I returned it to a local Borders and requested they order a replacement, but I'm still waiting for the new book to come in. This has been very frustratin 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 Doesn't fit well on my son's wrist. It is difficult to close, and when worn the thumb trigger only works 10% of the time. I think he's played with this once since getting it for Christmas. 
 Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling "Byzantine" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman 
 I disliked this book.Too many people reading the book might not go to a doctor to heal.I think that some foods can help you,but I strongly believe in doctors 
 I bought this book hoping I could find alot of information to start a small hobby farm on my 4 1/2 acres. The description of the book made it sound like it was very informative about raising animals, gardening, etc.  This book does cover all aspects. I wanted ideas on which animals are better to raise and such, particularly goats. I was very dissappointed on the section on farm animals. The writer wrote a bit about cows (probably because he raised them), he mentioned goats in about two sentences. All articles were so short and they were not helpful.  If you want to have a book just to read and not really use as a reference go ahead and purchase it. All the articles I wanted to know were all hard to find, had little information (really no information) and I felt that the writer just gave his own personal opinions and not facts.   For me I was dissappointed and now looking to find another reference guide to help me on my way to have a lovely hobby farm. I needed informtion on gardening, making maple syrup, canning/freezing, raising goats, raising beef cows, raising ducks and so forth. This book was not helpful at all.  :( :(  : 
 The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...  No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.  Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.  So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again 
 I'm not above a little mindless chick lit, and in fact have read dozens of Red Dress Ink books, but this one just isn't very good.  There are typos, and the writing style leaves much to be desired.  I also feel that the "friendship" between Lizzie and Clare feels off.  There's all this underlying tension and in their relationship; even before Clare gets mad at Lizzie for her actions, they don't relate to each other the way real best friends do.  I also find Matt to be completely unlikeable.  I have to admit: I'm no quite finished with the book, but I am not too impressed so far 
 I was disappointed that the "Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead 
 It makes absolutely no sense to buy this weak cd because this is the same as the blue print 2 with the exception of 2 songs.In my opinion most of the songs are weak anyways.He made this cd to fool people into buying it and in order to give him more money.This guy does not care about his fans or no hood,so stop supporting him already and save your money.All he cares about is caviar,crystal,jewelry,rides and cash.DO NOT BUY THIS WEAK CD!! 
 This book has a lot of fun ideas.  However, it does not provide a lot of useful Early Childhood school-based curriculum themes.  It has many themes that are not very useful in a school setting, such as:  'Containers', 'Dogs', 'Scissors', etc.  Possibly a good book for Childcare Centers or home Childcare Providers, not too good for a public school Early Childhood classroom 
 My six-year-old got this in her Easter basket.  She loves all kinds of art so we thought this would be something fun and different for her.   Not so.  The first page worked and she loved it, but the markers started to dry out very quickly.  By the time she got to the second page, the markers no longer worked well enough to dissolve the black coating.  My daughter colored over the same area about 100 times and still got only the faintest bit of the neon to show through.  She was very frustrated and heartbroken that her Easter present was such a dud.    I'd expect quality like this from RoseArt, but not from Crayola.  What a complete waste of money and time 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 As someone who is deeply interested in the Norse Mythos, I dove into this book with lots of enthusiasm, and it left me, well, not deeply impressed I guess.  I felt that anything pertaining to actual mythos was pretty good, but I felt the author become badly repetetive towards the end, and also became quite preachy.  Particularly near the end she starts criticizing modern civilization for not keeping the ways of the Norse, and then in the same chapter, make amazingly condescending remarks about them.  I felt this was an interesting read, but she needs to keep her emotions out of it 
 I bought this book in the hopes that it would bring out some interesting facts from the Bible and juxtapose them with scientific reality in a thought provoking way.  While there is some of that content, the majority of the work in this book is scantily researched, or just laughablly inaccurate.  For example, the author maintains that the early Christians had copies of the New Testament in 50 to 60 A.D.  Unfortunately, the New Testament wasn't brought together until the Council of Laodicea in 363 A.D.  The only thing close to scripture use by the early Church was the Old Testament and Paul considered Luke's writings to be as authoritative as the Old Testament (1 Timothy 5:18; see also Deuteronomy 25:4 and Luke 10:7).  Peter recognized Paul's writings as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16).  Some of the books of the New Testament were being circulated among the churches (Colossians 4:16; 1Thessalonians 5:27).  So many half truths and unresearched "facts" make this book a poor choice for anyone other than wild eyed collectors of Christian folk lore literature.  There are several chapters which are of interest, but on whole, this book was a waste 
   THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.   It amuses me that "fans" are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago.  THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it did.  As a fan, I was insulted.  Perhaps these other "fans" have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage.   
 Some of the ideas in the book are good. I am grateful for the short chapters because the writing is not that great. In fact half way through the book I could no longer read it. It was just boring and the chapter  design does not allow for a smooth transition. The book is choppy and the  Prince idea is more of a gimmick than a reality. Thumbs down for me! 
        As long as there is a radio there, your kids will soon be able to sing,if they are old enough to talk. It happened to me. I was probably in Elementary, and I may end up mumblin the words to Nirvanma's "Heart Shaped Box" to Radiohead's "High and Dry". IF I were to actually know the words to Janet's "That's the way Love Goes", my mom may actually worry about me singing about such sensual lyrics. Parents, look this up, and listen to your Top 40 radio station closely, and then look at the tracks. Your child may be singing along to a song that they have either never experienced, may sound awkward comnig fron an elementary child, or something you shouldn't wan to expose your child to easily. I don't really like or hate Kidz Bop, but the track choices could be a little better, and here's my explanation:  1. Behind These Hazel Eyes: a song about a misunderstood romane down the drain. A song like this to a kid will lead to more Jojos.   2. Beverly Hills: I admit this song is indeed fun. Even though this song is all about the materialism and glamour, on one hand, your kids will have the fun they deserved. On the other hand, what will you do when they really wish they were in the cities they see on TV? 3. Don't Lie: Imagine your brother in the car and you are singing this over and over again. Someone's going to get a time out for sure. THe singer driving you nuts in the carpool, or the big brother throttling your dear baby. 4. Wake Me Up When September Ends: This sounds wonderful if your kid actually experienced a death...as the song is about. Green Day is indeed kids band of choice, but sometimes you have to know the difference between good songs out of nothin and a song with an all too serious message. 5. Listen To Your Heart: I didn't even know kids knew about this song. The song is more about advice on a relationship, but they will connect wonderfully with the chorus. The hanging on every word part is pretty moot. 6. Just The Girl: They are not the new Beatles (truthfully), and this song sounds a little silly coming out of a child's mouth. After all, he's too young to want a girl so much, that he'd get pushed into a pool at his school reunion. 7. Pon De Replay: A Reggae or Reggaetgon is always a shocker because the kids won't know a thing that Rhianna's saying. It could have been a little more accessible for a song about partying. 8. Cool: Gwen Stefani. The real song is not likely to keep the kids attention. Just the occasionally irritating chorus. 9. Photograph: Is this Weezer? This song is good enough for a kid to listen to. This may also introduce them to Weezer's style right. 10. These Words: "I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you!" Isn't is just cute how she sings with a twisted tongue the words that just about got on YoUR nerves at the sixth listen. Once again a song tha may do  number on you or your family suring a carpool. 11. You And Me: This song may not catch your kids attewntion, even if it was on Kidz Bop with electric additives. The song sounds a little unengaing as a teenager. You may wan to keep this to yourself. 12. Feel Good Inc.: Gorillaz is Dark Pop. THe kids will have no idea that what 2D was singing was "Feel Good!" As for the widnmill, windmill" and "don't stop, get it, get it" part? 13. Chariot: Gavin DeGraw makes music for everybody to indulge into. Let this song introsduce children to him. 14. Boyfriend: once again ,too young to know the sitchy at hand. Apparently, someone was accused of manstealing. 9 year olds are too young to really know what a boyfrined is for. There fore, this song isn't really something you want them to listen up to. 15. Speed Of Sound: Eh. It's Coldplay. Let them enjoy a little bit of Lush music for their Lifetime. This isn't the best song to start with for children, though. 16. We Belong Together: A relationship gone wrong. PRobably the millionth of all of them that kids will sound very awkward lsitening to. 17. Wake Up: HIlary Duff? Kiddie Punk, I like to call it. LEt them have a little fun with DUff. she's a queen of the young people 18. Axel F (The Frog Song): Listen to the original Crazy Frog sample, listen to the song itself, then decide if you want your kids to do anything to the song in the car.  There you have it. WIth songs full of relationships gone wrong and made up and other pop stars that may actually have a good effect on your child, this album is, like every other, unstable for your children. I suggest that instead of buying this, listen to the original first closely, and tell me if you want your daughter singing about how "I didn't steal your boyfriend" or yelling "Don't Lie" in the caron the way to school. You'd be left rolling on the carpets and placing a White stripes CD in for relief as a parent. I say, look for something else. This is a musical equivalent to two fifths of Wonder Showzen on MTV2.  And no, teenagers. Neither Metallica nor AFI nor Cannibal Corpse will help your toddler become children with much balanced taste. But for the Kids, I suggest going to buy an album from The Boy Least Likely To. For those much grown to preteens, I suggest The Flaming Lips, The Go! Team, Lemon Jelly or The Polysics 
 So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT. 
 If you already own Lonnie Bird's Complete Illustrated Guide to Shaping Wood you will be extremely disappointed with this book.  It seemed that 80% was duplicate material.  The book descriptions says that this book expands on the techniques covered in Shaping Wood.  To me, it looked like nothing more than a page for page copy 
 I have to say that of all the books I've read on the Romanovs, this one just plain made me angry because it's not very impartial. I was under the impression that a historian would want to be as impartial & objective as possible in order to demonstrate "the truth." In this case, the author cakes the text with so much subjectivity, I couldn't even finish it. I'm as open as the next person when it comes to putting forth new ideas, but the book doesn't even do that. For anyone who's read anything about the dynasty, the author seems to have deliberately forgotten about anything else that's been written about it - including historical files and information already well known in history. His opinion is so prominent that it became more annoying  the more I read. I got the distinct impression he was actually "siding" w/ particular family members - rather than looking from the outside in. NOT a good read for people who love the rich history of the Romanovs. 
 Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as "Iron Heel" and "Martin Eden" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant 
 After using the scale for the first time, the body fat percentage showed at 26.6%. I have had my body fat tested professionally and I am around 20%. I know that body fat testing is not an exact science however; I feel that a 6.6% discrepancy is extreme 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 This book belongs to a tradition that was very popular in Oxford in the 1980s. It proceeds on the following methodology. 1. I (here: Annas) am not sure what Plato said. (fair enough) 2. Perhaps he said this: [statement] S. Anyway, that's what I think he said. 3. But S is seriously wrong/flawed/ridiculous.  4. How could Plato have been so silly as to hold S? 5. Rather, Plato should have said S" which, needless to say, is the view I hold privately. 6. Let me at length defend S", and stress again and again that this is what Plato SHOULD have said (but didn't). The inference is faulty in terms of authorial attribution from 2. to 4. Admittedly this would not be so unpleasant if it wasn't coupled with a massive interpretative UN-charity which Annas is prone to in just about every sentence. I'm not saying you should not argue with Plato and adore him mindlessly. But in Annas' case, being condescending and unsympathethic leads to a lack of patience with the text. As a result there is not a single sentence in the forms chapter that survives textual scrutiny and stands as an interpretation of PLATO.  So, if you want to read Annas, this is the book to get. She'll give you something to think about under headings 3. and 6.  If you want to know what PLATO thought you deserve better. If you can't find better (such as Michael Frede, Myles Burnyeat, and David Sedley; secondarily Gail Fine and Terence Irwin) here's the survivor's guide to render Annas' book less repulsive: every time you encounter the phrase 'Plato thought/said/claims' in this book, substitute for it 'on my interpretation of Plato etc.' You may start with the first and last page: "I guess everyone comes to Plato being repelled". True, on the Plato Annas gives us. "This is a disappointing and boring end to an otherwise intruiging book [sc. Republic], but I can't help it." True if the book in question is Annas'. And, no, you could have helped it.  P.S. Today the sole surviving practitioner of the above methodological butchery on Plato and Aristotle is David Bostock (e.g. his books on Phaedo and Theaetetus). He has received the singularly appropriate rejoinder by Burnyeat (Map on Metaphysics Z): if you claim, on the basis of YOUR interpretations, that a text is nonsensical we can always tell you "go back to the text: try harder."

 If you love America, then avoid this book. It would seem that yet again we have a book written by a very educated man who fits the quote by Ronald Regan. "Liberals are not stupid; they just know so much that isn't so."   It would seem that this man sat down to write a book about something that he has no idea about. When he starts with some wild ideas about how the world works and along the way gives no evidence to back up his warped ideas.   I do have one nice thing to say about this book. The typesetting was done very well. Unfortunately this is the high point of the book. 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 As brevity is the soul of wit, let me be brief.  First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task.  I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: "...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me."  I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be "Wordy, awkward, over intellectual".  Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: "Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me".   This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.  All I can say is, Read it, and see for yourself why you shouldn't read it (paraphrasing Samuel Goldwyn).  
 Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.    Simply put it clumps.  The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement 
 Self indulgent garbage from the pen of the once (it seemed to me anyway) infallible Mailer. What the hell was he thinking? I find it hard to believe that this mess came from the mind of the same man that wrote The Naked And The Dead. Ok, at some points the narrative can be readable, even enjoyable; a few protagonists certainly succeed in stimulating the reader at a few points; but by and large this is a rambling piece of piss. If you enjoyed this then I envy you because you are certainly easily amused, more than I can say.      Too often this book relies on nothing more than cheap shock value to engage the reader, artless descriptions of intercourse/ copulation which probably means heaven on earth for some panting voyeurs out there but sadly left me unmoved. Some might say I'm being a bit too scathing but I'm only voicing my opinion and I honestly think this book should be burned.  
 John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.  It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men 
 The film is well crafted, but I do take issue with the racial tones of the storyline. Stop making 'race' an excuse.   People get out of life what they put into it. This should have been a story of human triumph instead of some run of the mill sociopolitical statement. There is waay too much of this happening today.  My appologies to the production crew, but 1 out of 5 stars is all this movie deserves.       
 Much of the delight in Shaftesbury's writing lies in the counterpoint of style with substance. In this edition, his elegant 18th century English has been "translated" into 20th century American; not even the punctuation remains unchanged.   Shaftesbury's extensive quotations from Greek and Latin poetry are eliminated, replaced by prose English IN THE TEXT; why?  Footnotes for translations would have been a more sensible concession to modern educational expectations.  If you are an adult reading for your own pleasure, avoid this edition and search out an older one.  This Cambridge "text" is suitable only for undergraduates who do not really wish to read the book in the first place. 
 This was a gift for my son, who was quite disappointed. It was not what he expected and more than l dvd was damaged.  We had to return it 
 I loved the Little House books as a girl, and actually just read the last in the series this week.  I started with The Long Winter, and ended with this book, as I recently purchased the set of nine books for my children.    I wish that I had not read this book!  The entire book is depressing.  I feel that it spoils the lovely ending in These Happy Golden Years.  Yes, we can't help wanting to know what happens to Laura after she is married.  However, I really wish this book was published separately, as it really does not go with the set. None of her other books are depressing!  There is always happiness in the other books, even in the face of challenges.   As another reviewer stated, this book begins by re-telling the wedding proposal, but it contradicts the version in These Happy Golden Years.  Also, the overall voice of the writer is not the same as the other books.  There are also parts that are confusing, and not well written.  It is a fact that Wilder did not edit this for printing, and it is obvious that she did not intend to publish this. After only a few pages I really felt that she didn't even write it, that is how different it is 
 I read Hollister's Henry I recently and I must highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the English monarchy. I knew virtually nothing about Henry when I first began to read this book (as he is one of the less famous English rulers amongst the general public), and came away feeling as if I actually had met the man. Hollister's style is colorful and easy to understand and follow-even his more analytical chapters on the church and the sources he used are interesting.  If you want to learn something about a underappreciated figure in medieval history, give this biography a try. I am sure you won't regret it. 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I have read books about the Kennedy family since I was a child, and I am familiar with a lot of the historical incidents.  Some of the book was not historically accurate - I don't  believe Jackie was at the funeral of Patrick, and the author skipped her  job at Viking Press.  Also, the writing was choppy, and the chapters seemed  to end abruptly.  In fact, the book ended with her death, and it seems as  if he forgot to finish it.  The book appeared to be written in a hurry,  with very little continuity or accuracy.  I was very disappointed that I  wasted my time reading this book 
 There should beseveral pages of information about each state to make this book educational. It is not nearly enough for a 9-12 year old to learn from.  That is why we are returning it 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 I bought this one because of the good reviews here and I was very...very disaponted. It has more bass compared with most of the other speakers of the similiar size but the problem is that the music is twisted (in order to empasize bass) sounding like from a can. I returned it and bought a Klipsch Promedia 2.0 and there is simly no comparison!  It's not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform, but the  Bose's problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality.  I believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio. I still remember how I was excited when upgrading my OEM dell speakers to a entry-level 3.1 system for the first time.  Well, if you do not believe me, just buy a pair of Klipsch ProMedio 2.0 and see for yourself if Bose worths even $50.       
 I just have a big warning for anyone thinking of buying this book: it is a catalogue for blueprints that you can buy from the Hanley Wood Company. For some reason Hanley Wood calls their catalogues "books." Their choice, I guess.  I will get to what this catalogue is in a minute. What is important is what it is not. It is not a book about the Arts and Crafts movement. It is not a book of photographs of Arts & Crafts homes since almost all of the pictures are architects' renditions of what the finished houses might look like, not actual photos of what they do look like. It is not a book about Arts and Crafts interiors, which is what I thought it was. When I read about getting 85 "home plans," I was so excited to think that I would be getting 85 ideas for room paint jobs, furniture and fixture ideas, etc. None of that. There's just a handful of photographs of interiors and no real attention paid to that side of it: the dominant imagery is of what the building might look like on the street (curb appeal).   There are a lot of other books about the Arts & Crafts movement that can give you ideas for decorating or redoing an existing home. This just is not one of them. I'm now taking a look at "Living the Arts & Crafts Style: A Home Decorating Workbook."  If you are planning on hiring a bunch of carpenters to build you a house in the Arts and Crafts style, I would buy this book for sure, even though a lot of the plans are not very original Arts & Crafts looking. They have a lot of 2000s details like "great rooms" and three car garages, and some of them look like McMansions with some Arts & Crafts features added in. A lot of them though are original looking and rather nice. You just might find your dream house and won't have to hire an architect. Even if you are planning on hiring an architect, I would buy this little catalogue anyway just to keep him or her honest 
 I never freakin got this calendar cause they don't have anymore in stock or something. And I get Harry Potter movie calendars every year. It sucks 
 This book is very scientific and precise, but it is not easy to read. 
 I got mostly through the intro of this book and was immediately infuriated.  I sent this book right back to the store.  In the intro, it says natural is better, breast is best, I am not going to pretend that my goal is anything other than to convert you to my way of thinking.  So hello?  Who exactly IS this thinking woman?  I don't think it's the reader because it sounds like they will be told what to think, period, end of story.  I do not appreciate condescending tones in informational books.  They make it emotional when I am purely in search of facts.  It's true, I have never done this before and I am not an expert.  But at the same time, I am not an idiot.  I can read and comprehend.  I can participate in discussions and form my own opinions and beliefs.  Thanks for being straightforward with me, but I didn't buy this book to see one point of view.  I bought it to see what my options were.  I firmly believe there is no one right answer to all of this, and I would like the leeway to see all the answers in a factual way to decide what I want to do.  I will do the best I can, but I will not be put into a mold, thank you very much!  Not any mold.  Not the modern woman's "give me drugs now" mold, and not the natural woman's "hypnobirthing" mold, probably not Bradley or Lamaze either.  I will decide what to pursue after I am finished gathering information.    I feel like it is CRUCIAL for women to get an overview of the various methods and to select a strategy based on whether it is something within their personality to do.  Otherwise, I feel like it will be a waste of time when everything goes down as one will have to work as hard to "do the method" while already be working hard to get babies out.   I would not recommend this book if you are on the lookout for multi-faceted, non-biased, factual information.  Intead, check out "The Birth That's Right for You" by Amen Ness.  That book really gives you the lowdown on the birth process and a lot of different points of view on how women might cope based on their personality.  It isn't a side-by-side comparison on the different methods, but it is a realistic starting point and is chock full of information to better help a woman understand what she is in for 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 I spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice & that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl 
 This book and it's storyline could have been written by my 13-yr-old (without the sex).  I couldn't even stand to read beyond pg 5 
 If you're looking for a good baseball read, look further.  The absolute twerpiness of George Will comes across in this book.  It's clear that when he was a youngster, he was the nerdy kid in the schoolyard.  This is the typical example of a pinheaded intellectual trying to sound like an average Joe by writing about sports.  Give me a break George Will 
 This movie was even more ignorant (in a bad way) compared to that other movie THE STUPIDS and I thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well. The name of the movie (dumberer) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is. The old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy + it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh. Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it's worth every penny for comedy fans 
 I found this book at the library, tucked in between a Dr. Sears book and a book on weaning.  It looked like intriguing, and I expected it to be a book that helped to "normalize" the view of breastfeeding, showing simple vignettes of the realities (both good and bad).  Something more enjoyable to read than a "how to" manual. There is some of that.  In fact some of the short stories are priceless.  However, there are also many disturbing images which definately are not going to help to encourage breastfeeding or enlighten anyone about the reality of breastfeeding.   In fact, some of the more controversial stories (the ones about adult lactational fetishes or porn) only play off societies misguided beliefs that breastfeeding is or should be taboo.  The author mistakingly uses the term "breastfeed" to apply to a variety of uses for the breast, including non nutritive.  If the authors intent was to stir up thought and meaningful discussion about the subject of breastfeeding in our society, these stories detract from any of the positive messages included.   In my opinion the subjects of milk men, induced lactation, extended nursing and cooking with breastmilk are controversial enough for society.  The pornographic issues belong in a seperate book.   I would not reccomend this for anyone who is looking for more information on nursing in general, or who is considering breastfeeding but hasn't made up their mind yet.   Its a nice try, the idea of a book of vignettes that reveal the many different facets of lactation is definately something that I'd like to see on the market.  But this one goes too far.  
 I've been a Vampire Chronicle lover since I read The Vampire Lestat and have followed closely every single new Vampire Chronicles. I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.  I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.    Overall this movie was too long, lacked character development for most of the movies characters, was disjointed, and was historically inaccurate.  For a movie that garnered so much hype I was expecting much, much more.   
 I was a little dissappointed.  This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys.  The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props.   That's what this book needs.    It's a lot of words....  a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break.   After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed.  Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like.  Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review....   imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!!  (If the cover say's "Funny book" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book.  p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  But the pay-off is just not that great.  You may find yourself thinking "What's the point?" after finishing the novel.  This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.) 
 That's a direct quote from O'reilly. Instead he prefers to make inflammatory statements and and a lot of  misleading suggestions. It's hard to know what he actually likes, because he appears to make a living based on negativity and rage. (bad guys, ad nauseum). It's all tedious angry white male "daddy knows best" posturing. He wants his readers to see him as he sees himself: a tough oh-so-virile guy, who's true to his working class roots, despises privelege, and is grossly insulted by lables, e.g. "conservative."  When he dislikes, he rages, e.g. single mothers, George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston. He despises the Clintons, but he's hard pressed after all the revelations about the Arkansas Project to say why they are amoral so he just tells you they spend a lot of money, (which actually pales in comparison to Reagan and the noaccountability whopping spending of G.W., but he doesn't tell you that.) He dogs Bill Moyers ad nauseum.    Aside from rage, the book contains a lot of weird, frightening illogical stuff. He believes teenagers who were caught in the act should have been "publicly disciplined" (??) He believes Clinton's Torricelli deal led to 9/11 (&doesn't mention anything else that might have.) He tells Phil Donahue, that if he was in charge, he "would not target the civilians of Afghanistan, but bomb the infrastructure" of the country. (Huh? bombing the infrastructure does kill civilians.) He's obsessed with sex offenders and child abuse, which is weird given his own record. He's obsessed with "immorality" in the media & society, & its really disturbing the way the way he targets celebrities who are black as paragons of "immorality. " There is nothing enjoyable about this book. It's bleak. It's negative and twisted. The book is so grotesque, it's not even amusing to read as satire of a right wing ideologue 
 Bought this calendar instead of my usual 365 dog a day desk calendar last year.  Definitely inferior to the 365 dog days also by Workman.  I buy about 10 dog calendars per year for myself and as gifts.  This was the biggest and only disappointment of last years calendars.    
 This book is predicated on the false Christian belief that we are, when all is said and done, the ones who allow God to save us.  The final "savior" in the book is not Christ or his substitutionary sacrifice but the power of human prayer.  This novel perpetuates the false teaching that fallen people have the ability to decide for God and ultimately save their society.  It is a feel good novel that puts the spotlight on the unbiblical notion that if we manufacture good works for God, then he will bless us.  This "Christian" novel contributed to the silly notion after 9/11 that our prayers create a wall of defense around our nation.  The novel is misleading at best.  Go read Romans or Galatians again for the real way salvation works in the Christian faith 
 The game has weak content and strategy.  We played it twice but neither of us experienced any excitement.  The game is now shelved and I don't foresee it ever being played again.  Disappointed but somehow not surprised. 
 I was sooo excited to get a toaster oven combination but was ultimately soooo disappointed that this product did not last past 3 months!  I tried it twice - but twice the toaster feature did not withstand the test of (short) time.   I am still looking to replace this item with one of better quality that can perform both functions well.  
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 I truly expected more from this but from beginning to end it seemed trite, unconvincing and entirely too derivative.  The characters fall flat and the writing is simplistic.  At least it IS short 
 This work is difficult to read. There are enough exclamation points to exhaust most readers. A lack of humility and the self aggrandizement soon makes the reader quite weary. The subject matter is well woth exploring but the author gets in the way. I cannot recommend this book 
 So unmemorable I'm not even sure I read it. Books about damaged college professors have begun to blur for me. Please, can these supposed writers of fiction just stop writing about the faculty of small liberal arts colleges? I can't remember what happened in which. There was a coed involved. And some drugs, I think. Or maybe that was The Corrections 
 I unassumingly relied on the application deadline's published in this book. The Princeton Review did a HORRIBLE job of fact checking. I caught more than 5 schools deadline dates that were completely wrong. I am really frustrated because I was relying on that information and as I was going to apply to these schools only to find out that the deadline has already past is so disappointing.   My word of advice is to double check each and every deadline date for a school you want to attend. I would hate for anyone to have missed an opprotunity like me 
 I am giving the documentary 3 stars because there is some good interviews and tells the story of Jimi Hendrix with a lot of detail.  It was well put together by the film makers.  But at the same time I am taking a star away for making a Hendrix documentary without Hendrix music and another star for charging so much for a documentary that is not much longer than a regualar movie.  I agree with the other reviews that it is definitely worthwhile for a documentary and as far as documentaries it is one of the better docuemntaries about a musician that I have ever seen, but c'mon a Hendrix documentary without the music 
 The book is well written and easy to follow, but it is relatively generic.  I believe it to be a little over priced for its content 
 I found this an odd CD.  It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs.  It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is 
 It was very nice last summer.  I put it away after thoroughly drying it out (and about 5 other Swimways fish).  This summer when I opened them up and put batteries in only one worked.  The others are simply dead and are now trash.  If you are looking for a one-season toy, then this was fun, but if next summer comes around you will probably find that they don't work 
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 Ok... So lets make and EXTREMELY crappy zombie movie with grandpa's old movie camera and put a really cool picture on the DVD cover so it looks intriguing!    Good lord folks...This is BAD!              Quite rarely do I take a gamble and buy a movie that I have not heard about beforehand....and im POSITIVE It will never happen again. Even the 3.99 price tag on this DVD is far too costly as I am sure that I could find a decent drink coaster for cheaper. Anyone who likes this movie is either involved in its production or in a coma. 
 I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family.   I noted that some of "his" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself.  Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was.  He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being.  He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.    Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc.  I enjoyed the pictures 
 A big disappointment from a distinguished institute like the Culinary Institute of America.  A little book with even less info.  Headings with a paragraph or two will not help menager or even servers keep customers coming. This book needs a more explanations and examples - give incites to experiences 
 I am a 39 year old adoptee. What rubbish! Your parents are the people that raise you, period. My parents raised me to believe that my adoption was a 'non-issue', and I was always fine with that. Adoption is a truly wonderful thing, and I wish it were done more instead of abortion. I have never felt different from other kids who were not adopted. I just got my parents in a different way. If you are a 'progressive' parent that thinks you need to dwell on 'issues' and 'grieve', you will certainly create those issues.    Get a life people. Worry about something meaningful, please.   I've met my birth parents, found them when I was about 30. Nice people, but complete strangers. Not my parents. Not much in common. Grateful they put me up for adoption so I could have a good life that they would've been unable to give me.  Much more harm is being done today to children that their teenage and single moms keep them out of selfishness, and ruin the kids' life because they aren't ready to be a parent. If they really cared about their child, they would give them up for adoption. It takes courage, selflessness and maturity to make the decision to give a child up for adoption 
 All this is the instructions and qualifications for how to get PHR or SPHR certified.  I did not find it helpful at all for the price!  It does give a practice quiz (yes, just one) which I suppose is helpful but I would just go ahead and order prep materials and use those.  If you are nervous about standardized tests then I guess it's somewhat helpful because it goes in to how to take them and alotting your time...but if you are well-seasoned in them or any testing (as I am) then I would say don't bother 
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 While wearing more than one color at a time may have been considered risque in the author's time, wearing black and brown together is no longer the scandal she claims it was.   There are some useful points in this little book, but the author's continued insistence that one wear beige and wool (even in the summer!) quickly becomes tedious (particularly to those of us who, due to allergies and skin conditions, cannot wear wool under any circumstances).  And given the English penchant for dressing frumpily, it is a wonder why she continues to refer to the English as masters of taste.  The sad truth about any book like this (and this is no reflection on this book or the author) is that those who need to read it the most (the deliberately shabby and poorly groomed) are the least likely to read it 
 WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. PURCHASED THIS BOOK FOR MATH EDU COLLEGE CLASS AND IT WAS USELESS AND VERY OVERPRICED 
  Basic beginner information.Booklet was not what I hoped but still has some good areas 
 I bought this spinner because I love my KitchenAid mixer, a workhorse that has never disappointed.  This spinner however, has problems.  It has a confusing design, a handle that sticks up unappealingly, you have to "lock" the lid down before you use it and the pump handle is difficult to push down.  It does dry the lettuce eventually.  If you use your spinner a lot this one is not for you. I wish I hadn't bought it 
 I was so anxious to read this after waiting so long for the 2nd book.  I loved White Oleander.  This book is psychotic and not much of a story.  Very disappointing from a talented author 
 I purchased all of the Steppenwolf albums as they were released and found their first two or three albums to be excellent. This one, sporting silly gatefold graphics, embarrasing lyrics, and uninspired musicianship, was the only one that I sold to the local used record shop a few years ago. 'Nuff sai 
 My son loved this toy at christmas, however in less than an hour it was broken. The gears had stripped on one side, and it never made it out of the house.  Now, amazon.com was very good in saying they would send another...I sent the broken back...but the toy was on back order until April, 06.  I waited, at the request of my 8 year old son who wanted it so badly...the time came and went...the only way I knew what was going on was by my contacting them...they never bothered to let me know of any problems with the order...but always apologetic.  I finally asked for a refund in April because they told me it was still not available....now I'm stuck with the battery pack that doesn't go with anything else....and after reading all the other reviews, I wouldn't chance getting another one, even though my son did love it.    
 Worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed.  I'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it's impossible to make a waffle that doesn't stick completely to the waffle iron.  A complete waste of money 
 It is a good for children, big fantasy, nothing rea 
 I was looking for something to help me remember how to read and write music (which I hadn't done in 13 years and had basically forgotten).  I was disappointed to find that this book doesn't even touch on the subject of actually reading (much less writing) music, making it all but useless for me.  Basically, most of the book is dedicated to telling about popular chord progressions.  I suppose this could be useful if you are wanting instructions on how to improvise something as unoriginal as possible and want instruction on how to do what everyone else is doing and has been done to death.  Since I could improvise since I was in elementary school and want to be able to write down what I come up with I found this to be interesting trivia about what is common in pop, blues, etc., but ultimately not useful.  If you are looking for a basic book on chord progressions this could be what you need, though.  Anyway, I barely got this and realized I need to get another book because this simply didn't give me any information I found useful -- and oh, though short I found the writing dull, wordy, and a pain to read through 
 I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. - Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. - Software is a pain to use. - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.  That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: - Long battery life, recharges super quick - Very cool-looking player - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.   I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again. 
 I was in the library today, and the attractive cover of this book interested me. I picked it up, started reading it in Physics and was finished by Government. A quick read -- simplistic characters and an  aimless plot tend to save time. Think Princeton Review's College Guide with  some gratuitous sex thrown in. Then again, anyone who can write, "His  wiener was giant in there, like some burrowing gopher trying to dig its way  out of his underwear" with any seriousness whatsoever deserves  accolades. A pity Boylan didn't begin the book with that sentence. He'd  have won the Bulwer-Lytton contest easily 
 This book is essentially a reference manual for a professor. If you don't already know the material you will not learn it from this book. The price is outragous. This was the worst economics book I have ever bought. Please don't waste your money 
 It the Creative Zen MP3 player is plugged with the charger and play at the same time in the car, it gives out squeaky sound 
 Mr. Patterson is a bourgeois who understands freedom from a typical husbandman's perspective. What he doesn't see is the perspective of nomads, gypsies, wandering artists, etc., i.e. the moving crowd. He did not look at them, and by this missed the chance to write about a commitment to freedom much deeper and older than the attempts of the people bound to their soil or community. Also, he neglects the Jewish heritage of Christianity and its fight for freedom. Obviously he has not read Michael Walzer's "Exodus and Revolution". If he had, he would have known that the first successful attempt to become free from slavery did not happen in Greece but in the desert between Egypt and Palestine. It was not Greek rhetoric about freedom but the Exodus story that gave spiritual power to the civil rights movement 
 I only enjoyed one song.  The one they always play on the radio.  How disappointed I was to pay a high price to just enjoy ONE song.  
 I believe that the title of this book is misleading and the content does not live up to expectations at all. If I could, I would demand my money back.   What I expected in light of the title and other reviews was a light-hearted, witty and clever, perhaps sometimes self-deprecating and mostly amusing look at women's lifes and how we often stand in our own way with our sense of ueber-perfectionism.   What I got was a tedious read, and if I were in a nasty mood, I would even go as far as to say it was badly written. Veronica Chambers is trying too hard to be funny, and trust me, it doesn't work. Both, her style and the content did nothing to even remotely endear her to me and most of the time I was simply bored.   Maybe it is my fault and I had the wrong expectations, but even bearing that possibility in mind, it still doesn't deliver on the promise in the title.   Maybe it wouldn't have been as bad had she given it a title that reflected more of what the book really is: a diary of a woman who doesn't really have an awfult lot to say.   Which in itself wouldn't even be that bad, seeing as I have read numerous accounts of women who didn't really have much to say either - but they did so in such a charming, clever, witty and sometimes ironic way that made it possible to connect, or at least be entertained.   This book unfortunately does neither 
 I'll make this short and to the point.  This book exemplifies the worst aspect of the so called "religious right."  It shows that being judgemental is more important than being tolerant and hating is better than loving.  Worst of all, however, is that this author believes he is bringing to light Christian values that have supposedly become "lost."  I'd like to ask this Dave Kupelian one question:  Have you ever even read the Gospels? 
 I've read the last two volumes first.  Now I'm reading this first one and it is awful.  Where's the history on the United States or inventions or milestones.  All Martin Gilbert talks about here is war overseas.  He leaves one small paragraph a chapter for the US and any trivial information.   I'm skipping through it faster then any book I've read.  Thank god I read the 2 good ones first.   I would think there's more history to those years then just the Balkans and Russia 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 I rated 2 stars and the price is $2.99. "LET IT WHIP" by the Dazz Band,  2nd is  " CELEBRATION" by Kool and the Gang,  3rd is the "SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING" Peaches & Herb. The rest of the songs needs to be replace 
 What happened to this band? I know the great Terry Kath passed and all, but was going disco the best way to honor his memory?   Man, I'm just picturing one of my favorite bands all wearing leisure suits with their shirts open revealing mucho bling. We miss you Terry...but the band misses you more!! 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 I own a boarding kennel, I thought this might be interesting but found it to be down right dangerous. In my clientel 9 out of 10 were severly bitten or attacked by their pets for trying this phony practice. Only the owner knows their dog, here is a tip for a problem pooch.. try spending quality time with fido, not only training sessons. Lie on the floor and play with your pet, brush your pet, hug your pet. Think and get to know the breed or mix of breeds before your purchase or adopt and see if they will work for you. Not every gimic pet device works, especially not this one. I cant wait until this phase is over with.  
 My Iraq-bound son shelled out his hard-earned cash to buy this as a book-on-CD for us to "enjoy" on the ride home when we visited him prior to his deployment.I wish there was a way to get his money back!  "R is for Ricochet", is a truly abysmal addition to the alphabet series. I realize that some of my criticism might have more to do with the delivery by Judy Kaye ... but after reading many of the other reviews, I doubt it.   If you think that endless filler (think high school student with a 3,000 word essay to write) is tedious while reading it ... try having it read aloud to you. *groan* I can't tell you how many times we made the hands rolling "GET ON WITH IT!" motion.  What on earth happened to the feisty, risk-taking, down-to-earth, no-frills, take-it-on-the-chin heroine we know and grew to love? Kinsey Millhone is utterly unrecognizable in this story. Here, she is wimpy, gullible, tentative, and full of teenage angst, a regular worrywart. In fact, she is downright stupid in many scenes.  Her alleged "friendship" with the ex-con Reba, was laughably contrived. They have zero in common and Kinsey is ten years her senior. Reba was a totally unbelievable character ... one minute a train wreck, the next ... brilliant star detective.   As for Kinsey's new romance ... oh puh-leeze! Sue Grafton was so obviously trying to imitate Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli. Why on earth would clothing-challenged Kinsey fall for a snappy Italian dresser in expensive designer clothes? So NOT her type. How would she even recognize these designer clothes for what they are? The Kinsey I know would have commented that the guy looked "good", period! And don't even get me started on the girlie clothes shopping scene. Kinsey ... you used to have a backbone, what happened?  Finally, I totally concur with those who wondered where on earth the title "R is for Ricochet" fitted in!? A cut-and-paste "mystery" that Sue Grafton should have been ashamed to put her name on.  Skip this one for sure ... I was so disappointed with "R is for Ricochet" I doubt I will ever pick up another Grafton 
 This book is very misleading.  First of all, as stated in the other reviews, there are an enormous amount of errors located in the book.  I could see this backfiring on many people who are new to the information as the contradictions and misprints will leave a newbie wondering which idea is correct.  I have taken the CEDIA exam and I can say that not a single question located anywhere in that book was on the exam.  I think the book could be a good overview learning tool if they would have bothered to proof read it before going to print 
 Hansen claims to be original in stating that witchcraft really can be effective in a society that, like 1692 Salem, is convinced of its effectiveness. Of couse, in 1937 this view was already put forward by anthropologist Evans-Pritchard in his Witchcraft, Oracles And Magic Among The Azande. Hansen relies on (pathological) hysteria as the explanation of the accusing girls' behaviour, and sees judges, jurors and the mass of the population as neurotics. He offers no explanation as to why an epidemic of hysteria and neuroticism could break out, but is keen to rule out the repressiveness of Salem's Puritan society. Besides, he virtually eliminates fraud and intra-village rivalry as causes, though much of the evidence he presents suggests the opposite. A biased book at best. However, one has to bear in mind that it was written in 1969, well before the past decade witnessed new insights gaining ground. This is underlined by the fact that Hansen's bibliography mentions Margaret Murray's book, which is nowadays only read by would-be and/or do-it-yourself witches and not by serious students of the subject, as a "most important" work 
 I found this book useless!  Filled with stories of incredible survivors, it gave me no clue how to tap into any of that strength for my own use.  I couldn't even finish it.  Just crap

 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Like the last reviewer, I agree this album has great music and is worthy of listening.  But what isn't obvious is what is behind the release of this music.  A few years ago the record label abruptly cancelled Cracker's recording contract.  Now that same record company that turned it's back on this great band is trying to cash in on Cracker's loyal following.  In great Cracker fashion, the band released it's own Greatest Hits album the same day.  It's called Cracker Greatest Hits Redux and the proceeds of this album don't go in the pockets of the greedy recording company.  If you like Cracker and want a compilation, buy Garage d'Or or Greatest Hits Redux.  
 I realize that I'm supposed to think "Empire" is brilliant, because it's Gore Vidal, but it is a major bore.  Nothing actually happens; its just 400+ pages of dialogue.  A well-written conventional history of the period would be more enjoyable and more informative.  This is a total snooze-fest 
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
 Written by a failed spiritual seeker turned anti-spiritual polemical secularist, this book lacks the substance and insight possessed by a vaguely similar but nevertheless far superior work of disenchantment, Jeffrey Masson's *My Father's Guru*.  Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge.  Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism.  Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?!  The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read.  Sadly, this work is by and large flat.  So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi 
 How can you write a new biography about the Virgin Mary when you have only the gospels? Lesley Hazelton's solution is to use anthropological and historical information to fill the background. Starting off with the basic facts about being a first century Jewish peasant, she uses information about Galilee, being a healer, pregnancy and childbirth, first century polytheism, and nasty details about crucifixion. In her view Mary, or Maryam, was pregnant at thirteen. She was probably a healer who taught her son. She certainly would have assisted the rebellion that broke out on the death of Herod the Great in 4 BCE. She may have been raped, possibly by a solider, possibly by priests. Notwithstanding that traumatic event, she was "a strong woman of ability and wisdom who actively chose her role in history, and lived it to the fullest." Now a reader might look at Hazleton's rather sparse notes, and note some scholarship, but a closer look would reveal that never gives page numbers. In fact this is simply a reverse of the old devotional lives. Where they portrayed Mary as an exemplar of Christian dogma, she portrays her as a New Age hero. Both do violence to the real Jewish Mary.    One of Hazleton's flaws is anachronism of evidence. She relies on a mid-century history of Palestinian peasant life, and then assumes that there were no changes in the intervening nineteen centuries. She uses Barbara Ehrenreich's deeply flawed book on medieval midwives to argue that Mary would have been a healer. Even if women were healers at that time, it does not follow that Mary would be one of them. She uses information from the Intafada to argue that Mary would have supported the rebellion on Herod's death. (Later still she argues, against the evidence of both Matthew and Luke, that Jesus was actually born ten years after Herod's death, which means that Mary would have been 2 at the time of the rebellion.) There are other examples of Hazleton's shallow grasp of Palestinian history. Contrary to what she says, there is some evidence of synagogues at the time in Galilee. Herod the Great would not have thought about declaring himself a divinity, since he was actually Jewish. Palestine was not of strategic value because it was part of the Grain land route from Egypt to Rome; grain would have been shipped entirely by sea. Contrary to what Hazleton says, Galileans in the Roman era were not descended from the old Israeli monarchy. They were fervently Jewish who probably descended from settlers in the second century.     These errors allow Hazleton to make the preposterous claim that Mary was a Goddess worshipper, and even said prayers to Isis! There is no evidence to support such a suggestion. Josephus refers to the Galilean's devotion, and the archaeological evidence clearly shows that there was no major Gentile presence at this time. Exclusive monotheism is one of the clearest and best attested ideas of first century Judaism. There is certainly no evidence that Mary would have been aware of the esoteric, much later, gnostic speculation that Hazleton (of course) links her to. But then Hazleton's ideas about religion are pretty sentimental. She has John the Baptist believe "that God was inside you, not in a temple," an idea that was "an early manifestation of the democratic spirit." In point of fact John clearly argued that the world faced imminent judgement for its sins. Hazleton may prefer the cosmopolitan and tolerant virtues of paganism, but they have nothing to do with Mary. One should add that the book in infected with purple prose about fertility and Mary's grief over the crucifixion. One should note that Hazleton talks about things that she has no way of knowing, such as saying there was no "romance" in first century Palestine, or what age girls were married at, or how many children they were likely to have, or what Mary's grandmother was like. There are also several pages where Hazleton tries to have it both ways on Mary's sexuality. Obviously Mary isn't drearily celibate, but on the other hand it would be crudely rationalist to deny her virginity.     The simplest explanation is also the most reasonable. There is no evidence that Mary was a Christian, only that she survived the death of her son. Both Paul and the Gospels clearly state that Jesus had siblings. To say that they were merely cousins or kinsmen is simply gratuitous assertion, which can be gratuitously denied. Christian dogma denied Mary her family and her religion because it undercut the doctrine of perpetual virginity and, more important, the Incarnation. Hazleton does the same thing, but claims that this is an act of empowerment. Readers should not be similarly deluded 
 This book is very much for the Cosmo mag crowd, I'd suggest getting another book if you do not fit into that category. And if you do fall into the crowd, after you read this one you really should check out better books on this subject with more helpful info (even if it isn't as cute). 
 Around the turn of the century, record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials. Needless to say, all of these attempts have failed. Great songs were overlooked, and instead of giving a quality overview of the band, one got instead the feeling of being ripped off. The Cure's Greatest Hits falls victim to the one disc overview.  A greatet hit album serves two purposes. One is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album. The second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career. The problem with The Cure is that they have released over 30 singles, and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work.  For instance, how does a Cure best of ignore "Pictures of You"? It would be akin to a Billy Joel best of leaving off "The Stranger". This song is considered one of the Cure's best, and leaving this off for stuff like "The Walk", "High", and "Never Enough" is an insult.  While "Pictures of You" is the biggest example of a song that is missing, there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there. For instance, the sublime "Catch", the melancholy "A Night Like This", or even "Jumping Someone Else's Train." And what about their break-out single, "Killing An Arab"?  The problem with this album is that it attempts to provide an overview of the Cure but instead only barely touches the surface. Leave this one on the CD racks and spend the extra money to get Staring at the Sea and Galore 
 This is a sincere comment on this product, and my first one ever. I bought it and I was excited to try it out in my bedroom. The unit looks pretty nice and for the price it definitely felt like a good deal.  However, the bass sound is absolutely terrible... I did read about this in another review, but I didn't expect that it would be this bad.   I actually checked the EQ setting of my iPod to make sure it wasn't in a "bass boosting" mode or anything like that. I was hoping that if I turned it off I'd get an OK sound and I'd not have to go through the trouble of returning it.  My advice: * Don't buy this product *  It's the only way we can tell these companies (on the market just for the money) that they cannot just have a good external "fashion" design and a good marketing campaign that they will fool us and make money. 
 The book seems to have very good pictures and images, however I am not comfortable with the stories of Takata and Usui. They seem to be very limited to the Western Mind of thinking and not encompassing the true idea  that Authentic REIKI is  Japanese. In another book I found reference to the  author being affectionally called Gijean.. This blew the credibility of the  book completely away for me as Gijean is a slam or a racial slur meaning  something on the order of "Pompous Arrogant American" as is the  Hawaiian term Ha'ole 
 Yes.  I read the reviews for this book, and was encouraged, thinking I was getting a good beginner-intermediate level guide for programming games with DirectX.  Boy, when I dug in, I was almost immediately overwhelmed by the complexity of the code samples (many of which do not even compile; they use declaration types that are not supported in any includes......yes, I included all of the proper files and linked them).  The author gives you several pages worth of code, saying "This class does this; this function does one thing, that function does another thing, call this function to...do whatever"...the list goes on, and on, and on.  The author never goes into detail explaining what the code actually does and more importantly, HOW IT WORKS.  He just says "create this object to do this, then call that function" throughout the entire book.  Never does he explain what you are actually doing and why it is important.  It is bad enough that he gives you pages of source code, then he leaves you on your own to make it work.  His writing already assumes that the reader knows DirectX through and through.  Code samples are also incomplete a lot of times and the reader is left with no clue to what a certain variable/object is because there is no declaration.  AVOID THIS BOOK.  IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY 
 I like to find movies in which current "stars" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.    Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm.  Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized.  She's a very charming control freak.  The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be "hysterically" funny, nor worth the repeat view.  I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of "not yet a household name". 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 Personally, I don't like this book.  It reads like a big dictionary... lots of words but nothing tying things together.  I found it difficult to find and follow a set of concrete steps to help get a PMO up and running.  I understand it is "complete" but it does it at the expense of the "shotgun effect"--throwing a lot of stuff out but not really zeroing in on anything.  I think this book would be great for someone who needed to pick and choose a few specific things and wanted a reference but as a day-to-day book to help with setting up a PMO and figuring out how to get a PMO effort off the ground in a way that ensures success, it misses the mark unfortunately 
 Before I can say anything else about this book I much point out what I found to be the most startling aspect of Small Wonder... Kingsolver invokes the imagery of 9/11 so frequently and as the justification for so many different things I felt like I was watching a Bush press conference.  I know we are suppose to tiptoe around when speaking about mass homicides so I am not sure if this is political correct to say but... Kingsolver was a better writer before 9/11 than after.  Obsession and passion are one thing but too often she just settles for trite instead as in the laughable line "If I got to make just one law, it would be that the men who make the decisions to drop bombs would first, every time, have to spend one whole day taking care of a baby."  Speaking of men dropping bombs... I was also extremely surprised by Kingsolver's frequent reinforcements of gender serotypes.  While on the one had she briefly mentions wanting to instill in her young daughter what she could be a doctor or whatever she wanted to be on the other she so often associates war and other vices with men and home and hearth with women.  "When the going gets tough, seems like men reach for a weapon and women look in the pantry."  Although I don't really understand the point she was trying to make there I do understand it enough to know that it represents a sexism I was surprised to find Kingsolver support frequently.  Another big turn off for this book is that in many of the essays a lecturing tone is adopted and in the marketplace of idea nothing will make me roll my eyes at you quicker than an attitude of superiority.  Another big stumbling block that Kingsolver must overcome in future works if she wasn't to have a greater impact is that although she does have a point she is trying to make (well, in most of her pieces anyways) she is often disorganized in presenting it; one word - outline!  While the previous flaws apply to her work as a whole a much more narrow problem only present in one or two of the essays but yet infuriating to me is that she sometimes invokes high minded principles in ways that only the white, wealthy and well fed can.  In particular I am speaking of her stance on genetically modified foods.  While yes there are a number of important unresolved questions regarding such foods (and genetic engineering in general) what cannot be denied is the increased food yields that such crops have produced.  For a well fed suburbanite to implore others to starve for her idyllic beliefs almost caused me to put away the book for good but I am glad I got through the rest of it.  While the wonders here are in fact small... and few there are still a few exceptions.  `Letter to a Daughter at Thirteen,' `And Our Flag Was Still There' and `Going to Japan' were all good - not good enough to redeem the book as a whole but still good 
 A basically dishonest movie, lacking the courage of its convictions. This oscar-winning movie is in favor of illegal abortion, adultery, law breaking, disobedience of authority, yet it is shot in soft focus, like a Capra, feel-good movie!. The constant references to Dickens are more wishful than actual; old Charles would most likely be against all the values this film celebrate 
 I've enjoyed John Kotter's work in the past. I've found his work useful and effective. However I learned nothing new from this book. The story line is poor and the approach outlined in the narrative to effective change management does not provide any better or new approach.  I'd suggest Stephen Denning's books on business narrative (eg the Springboard) for those who are looking for a narrative-based or alternative approach to facilitate change 
 When this jumpdrive was plugged into my Windows 2000 system, the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive. The Lexar "technical support" was no help at all. They told me to reinstall my system.  Luckily the computer repair person I hired was able to recover my data files before the OS was reinstalled. Lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost.  I will never purchase one of their product again 
 The concept is good, however it is just not functional.  The game system itself barely fits inside.  There are 2 small pockets for storeage of game books and the cartridges...which if you have more than two barely fit.  It does not organize well and I am afraid that the cartridges will fall out at some point.  This product is not worth the $20 we paid for it 
 Not a whole heck of a lot happens in the 90 minute film in which a woman wanders through the streets of Paris as she anxiously awaits a medical appointment at which she will receive the results of a test.  She buys a hat, meets up with a friend, talks a walk in the park etc.  The events all unfold in real time and the early 60's mostly black and white cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous but on the whole this one comes across a little too self consciously arty for its own good.  Nice, at times, but hardly profound. Perhaps this was more compelling back in 1962.  2 1/2 stars 
 We were forced to read this book in my 10th grade english class along with Things Fall Apart and No Longer At Ease. I found all of his writing to be dull and non-capitvating and his plotlines, uninteresting. I was one of the few in my class who actually bothered to finnish the book, and I am sorry I did because it was such a waste of time. Not only are there so many more authors who write so much better than Achebe that we should be reading in school, but we should not be subjected to explatives in our literature. It was like Achebe had just descovered curses and sex for the 1st time and wanted to use as many references as he could in the book. Students should have some say in the language and subject matter that they have placed in front of them 
 This book says nothing. He brings you on a journey through nothing that will you unfilled. Don't read it 
 The information in this book more basic than I had expected. The quality of the paper and the printing is also very cheap. This book is definitely not worth the price I paid 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 When Cocker has the right song (meaning a nice raw rocker), he turns out intense, emotional music. When he has slick 80s radio pop backing, the results are usually less involving.   HIGHLIGHTS: His 90s smash "When the Night Comes" is truly great, combining a nice slowly building melody, some gospelly overtones, and a nicely restrained vocal that belts when it needs to. Outside of that one, his duet with Jennifer Warnes on "Up Where We Belong" continues to sound good. (Who on earth ever envisioned THAT pairing?!?! And how do we thank them?) An updated live version of   Beatles cover "With a Little Help from my Friends" is an electric epic, going from strength to strength.  LOWS: Cocker is NOT Jeff Lynne...not even if you back him with a Lynne produced track like "Night Calls". I'll stick with Tom Jones' version for the definitive "You Can Leave Your Hat On" (likewise Ray Charles' take on "Unchain my Heart").  BOTTOM LINE: Most of Cocker's best stuff is late 60s, early 70s material like "Feelin' Alright" and "You are So Beautiful". You can get those and the best bits of this one on Hip-O Records ULTIMATE COLLECTION (ASIN B00016MSXU). Get that one instead. 
 FOrget it. I am an ivy league grad who had a hard time following this book. It is bland and boring. And so complicated--who has time to follow all  of it. What a waste of money 
 I bought this book because I though the author had a funny approach to the subject. I started reading it and I found it had a nice sense of humor. However, after reading 5 chapters and not getting any significant knowledge about MAC OS X, I felt the book really felt short of its main purpose. As a comedy book is great especially for computer geeks like me, but man...no meat on this one. The chapter on troubleshooting is basically "DO NOTHING"....what??? Buy the missing manual from David it is a much more comprehensive book. Not as funny, but you actually get pretty good at learning MAC 
 This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book 
 This is by far the worst book I have ever read.  It is dull, boring, and you don't even have a clue as to what is going on until about the 20th chapter (and it only has 22 chapters) 
 The teacher who teaches this is an enviromentalist wacko and this book can be used solely for that purpose 
 We purchased a copy of this title for our library and were disappointed to learn that the DVD cannot be played in a standard DVD player (connected to a television set), but must be played in a computer DVD drive.   
 I started with Branson's first book, "Losing My Virginity", and was absolutely hooked.  That book is compelling, insightful, exciting, inspirational, and well-written.  "Screw it, Let's Do It" on the other hand, is none of those things, and feels like a cheap re-hashing of "Losing My Virginity", but without any of the real substance.  The writing is poor (leading me to wonder if Branson had a lot of help in writing "Losing My Virginity") and he rushes through anecdotes that he explains in detail in "Losing My Virginity". The whole book feels very cursory and surface-deep, and doesn't do justice to Branson's incredible persona.  Don't waste your time, get "Losing My Virginity" instead 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 If you are looking for a book for middle school to high school readers that challenges them to think about the real experiences of children in a brutal fascist state, I would skip this one and read instead "Emil and Karl", written by Yankev Glatschteyn in 1940 and only recently translated in English. It is also short, also features two naive 9-year-old boys, also gives multiple points of view, and also seems to be trying to send out a wake-up call to young people. The difference is that Emil and Karl is well-written, moving, accurate, and full of well-rounded characters across the spectrum of opinions and backgrounds, while "The boy in the striped pajamas" is maudlin, insulting, shallow, and inaccurate. It would be good for a literature teacher to assign both books, and let the students see for themselves the difference between quality literature and trash. Don't waste your money on Boyne's weak attempt 
 Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer.  It doesn't work with every bike, it didn't with mine.  I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective.  So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don't work together and I'm out $85.00.  Horrible 
 When I started to read this book, I thought to myself that it would be a good book. 5 Hours later, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to dump the book. The plot is horrible and there are a number of errors in the science. First, the first three dimensions define matter. The fouth one defines TIME! Second: 1 Billion Years from now, Humankind would have settled atleast a 1,000 star stystems and achived travel from Galaxy to Galaxy. Third, how would a lifeform like the Malign survive in space? It needs oxygen or some kind of Gas to survive (Newton - Energy cannot be destroyed, only simply converted). By the way, ANYTHING bigger then a stellar mass (size of our sun), would collapse and Nuclear Fusion would occur. This does not fit with the fact that some creatures out there that are as big as solar systems...      Although the author got the some science right, Humankind would NEVER create different species of itself and then destroy/extinctize (New Word I created there) the previous type of species. Its just tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   idiotic. So do youself a favor, get another book to read. 
 This pathetic book is organized as though it's geared for morons - "from A to Z", with absurd topics like 'people like Frank' and 'chipped tooth'. There's even a chapter called 'Pabst Blue Ribbon' in which the author merely tells about how he couldn't find this brand of beer in his local store. Why put this in a book? Also, the chapter concerning Laura Dern, who had a major role in this movie, is only 2 pages and makes the amazing declaration that her mother is Cheryl Ladd! (it's Diane Ladd.) That shows you how much research was put into this book - none. The author is just a guy who is a fan of the movie, did very little research and interviewed no one about it, and spews his pedestrian opinions willy-nilly. For instance, Frank Booth was meant to represent a purely evil, subhuman, subterranean insect in this movie, yet the author goes on about his "pathos" and endearing qualities. And maybe you want to buy this book because there'll be some interviews with the stars, director, or ANYONE? Forget it - all you get are the author's takes on the film, period. He does quote Hopper and Lynch, but only one-liners. Don't waste your time on this mess, or the other book in this series about Goldfinger, either. They're not serious analyzations of the movies - only the uninformed opinions of British fans who got lucky enough to have their books published. The book is intended only for those maniacal fans who'll buy ANYTHING related to the movie. The few pictures are merely stock stills from the movie...no behind the scenes stuff. I wasted my money on this, so please heed my advice and forget this book exists. For a MUCH better, far more intelligent analysis of "Blue Velvet", get Danny Peary's book "Cult Movies" (it's in either vol. 2 or 3) 
 I was suprised and dismayed to learn that this Brother FAX-575 is among the most popular fax machines Amazon sells.  The print and copy quality are inadequate, the machine shrieks in an especially tiresome manner, and the overpriced ribbons need frequent replacement.  Even at the highest resolution setting, recipients of my faxes complain about not being able to make out even typed text.  The dusty old laser fax I paid five dollars for at a garage sale takes much longer-lasting toner cartridges and completely outclasses the FAX-575.  The 575 is, however, a surprisingly adequate phone, with exceptional volume and voice quality.  Go figure 
 As the title of this anthology makes all too obvious, the essays in this volume are little more than a rehearsal of hackneyed, misinformed myths about radiation and nuclear materials. The authors seem to flaunt their almost complete ignorance of the subject they are addressing as a mark of virtue. The only redeeming aspect of this book is that it demonstrates the remarkable similarity between the attitudes of the academic left and the Christian right toward scientific matters which they are unwilling to understand or incapable of comprehending 
 Let's be frank, shall we? This mock sci-fi is just one more take on "can't we all just get along".  How transparent.  Dress up the black guy in a silly rubber suit and pretend he's an ALIEN.  Involve him in SPORTS!  There aren't many films that make me curse out loud, but this is one of them.  Treacly and brain-dead beyond endurance, the only thing that might have saved it would have been a spirited rendition by poor Gossett of "It Isn't Easy Being Green".  One of the other reviewers mentioned Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune in HELL IN THE PACIFIC. I couldn't agree more. That film, essentially the same thing, is immeasurably better.  Do yourself a favor: skip this exploitive garbage and watch either HELL IN THE PACIFIC or some genuine science fiction. 
 After reading all the reviews and the novel, I've come to the conclusion that you either really love the novel or you hate the novel.  There seems to be little room in between.  As for me, I belong to the group that did not enjoy this novel and its hard to pinpoint why.    I thought the author did a great job with the tone of the novel, a sort of sparse, dead, dreary tone.  But during some moments of the novel, I wanted some kind of emotion and felt little from the characters.  Even when Edward died or the scene when DeFoe smashed up Helen's house.    All the characters were so strange in their thoughts and actions, I just could not relate to them.  I did not understand what caused Imogen's identity crisis, why DeFoe loved her so much, why Helen and the museum currator took it upon themselves to plan and take her to Amsterdamn. And why did everyone think stealing the painting, even for a night, was a great idea?  And in what way did Edward, DeFoe's uncle, love Imogen too?  I didn't think he loved her, I just thought he was a jerk to get involved in Imogen and DeFoe's relationship and then flaunt it when he'd practically raised DeFoe.    I don't want to sound too negative about this novel.  I think for me it just wasn't my type of novel.  There were just too many questions left unanswered and too much analysis and symbolism.    
 After my Nextel phone started acting up, I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the "In" calling was a bonus. I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860. You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). Then, you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that I imported from random WAV, midi and MP3 files. You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). All in all, not what I grew accustomed to with my i860.  I'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. And that leads me to another rip-off with Verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! Next time I'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my Nextel 
 This movie is the story of a man, Mark Desantis, who is killed.  Mark's laptop is harpooned and then he is eaten by sharks.  His friend, Shark Expertman, suspects foul play.  So he and Mark's sister go on a shark filled adventure to the bottom of the fishing grounds of some local tribesmen.  The tribesmen didn't harpoon Mark's laptop though so the heroic duo look elsewhere.  Then they find bad scientist.  He is bad, or is he?  But he is bad, because the whole movie is bad so are all the actors.  The shark footage is good, but because it is literally ripped from past "Shark Weeks" it was really familiar.  As a final note, the last shot of a shark clearly shows a fishing line stuck in it's mouth.  This line has nothing to do with "Shark Attack" but probably had something to do with the Discovery Channel episode it was initially filmed for.  This movie should be shark attacked.  Poop 
 It thought it was more clever than it was.  Same goes for the humor 
 This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it 
 A MAN SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST A GANG THAT STOLE HIS MOTORCYCLE. STRAIGHT UP PREDICTABLE AND UNDENIABLY BORING. VAN DAMME LOOKS SO TERRIBLE IN THAT BEARD, I HOPE HE NEVER DOES A MOVIE WITH HIS BEARD LIKE THAT AGAIN. THE MOVIE IS STUPID, THE PLOT IS SO LAME, AND THE ACTION IS SO BORING. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW A DIE- HARD FAN OF VAN DAMME COULD LIKE THIS! THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN STORES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH ONE CENT OF ITS PRICE. IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. A WALK IN THE WOODS IS MORE EXCITING THAN THIS. IF THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES APPEAL TO YOU, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW YOUR ACTION MOVIES TOO WELL 
 I really liked the movie "the Hours", loosely based on this book, so I thought I'd read it... I couldn't get through it.  I love many classic books, but I'll not try another by Virginia Woolf 
 This is not a natural peanut butter.  The listed ingredients are peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt.  Natural peanut butter, such as Smucker's and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt.  Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients.  
 Beware of KINGSTON rebates!  Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.  I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).  The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.  About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."  Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.  After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.  If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.  For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.  Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.  Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.  I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams 
 and finally gave it away. While I think it's a great concept, I don't find it a page turner, or enough to make me care about any of the three characters Ms. Hager Cohen follows throughout the book 
 i bought this album one day and i regret it SO bad, i mean i wasted 17 bucks on the lamest cd i could ever buy. take my word for it, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!!!!! 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 This book is very poorly written and badly organized.  Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly.  Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable.  I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel.  I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience.  The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach.  Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor.  
 Let me start this review with a quote from page 388 of the UK paperback version:   "Yes, there is no doubt that many people who were abused become abusers themselves - it's a cycle..."  No, it is not, Peter Robinson, it is a myth and, in giving such statements to a  character who is meant to be a qualified "psychologist", you are perpetuating that myth. And not on one occasion but several during the course of the novel.  Whilst it may be true to say that most abusers were abused themselves it does not mean that "many" victims go on to perpetuate the cycle of abuse - some go on to self-harm, many others become "care-takers", e.g. nurses, doctors, policemen and women and social workers. I myself have worked as counsellor to a number of men who were sexually abused or raped and they have enough to deal with without this myth being trotted out and foisted on them by the likes of you. If you are going to deal with such a sensitive subject, might I suggest that you actually do some research!  Of the last 30 crime stories I've read, I can't think of one of them that hasn't featured childhood sexual abuse as a plot device to one extent or the other. How sad is that? How uninspired? And this one is not even well written! The dialogue is corny. The descriptive passages drone on and on. It is padded out with numerous uninspired sub-plots that add nothing. The only redeeming feature of this novel is that I borrowed it from a library and didn't waste my hard earned cash on it. My recommendation is: don't waste yours.  
 This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame 
 This is a really, really, really, really, bad movie. Don't watch it, don't buy , don't even think about this movie, you may get brain damage. Acting is horrible, plot line is ridiculous, and who...wrote this terrible script. Ghetto people don't even talk like that 
 Ron Rhodes does not seem to possess the scholarship and background knowledge needed to produce an accurate guide to the Christian denominations in North America. His accounts of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are especially poor. A frankly embarrassing level of ignorance leads Rhodes to make numerous historical, theological, and terminological errors of fact. One despairs of an author of a "complete guide" who can write concerning the First Vatican Council (1869/70):"More than 800 Roman Catholic priests (sic) from around the world attended." Forty years ago a Jesuit priest, the late Father John Hardon, S.J., published "The Protestant Churches of America", a work of such impartial, objective, and deep scholarship that it was set as a textbook in many Protestant seminaries. So the task is not impossible 
 Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing.     First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones.     Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope.     Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser "On Writing Well," which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, "On Writing"; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing.. 
 As a big fan of Molotov, I was very dissapointed with this record, honestly dont waste your money on this record. And if you are a fan of this group and still want to be, dont even listen to it. This group started with a great album (¿Dónde jugarán las niñas?) but since then, they are going down........Not a fan anymore.... 
 I always end up watching these types of movies on TV, years after their release. And usually I watch them for the pure fun of mocking the cheesy cliched plot and bad acting. Hilary, as usually delivered a spectacular performance...as herself. The plot...what was it again? She stopped singing due to a death in the family? Learns to raise her voice...and move on...that that person will always be in her heart?    Also kiddies, we learned to lie to people for our own benefit...maybe if Terri had her heart to heart earlier all the sneaking etc. would not have had to happen...just a thought. But no...they have to add conflict. Not that it made the movie better...just more pathetic.  If you want to watch a predictable movie, with Hollywood morals and mediocre acting this would be it. 
 This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.  In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.  Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."  No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.  Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.  Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.  ****A Side Note**** For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about 
  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead. 
 I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review.  This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript.  To compare it to "Run Lola Run" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend "Cube".   
 99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)  after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one 
 What a disappointment! The book deals with a key element of software development but unfortunately lets the reader down in so many ways! While the topics covered should have been useful, I suspect that the most common word in the book was "I" - as the author regales the use with instances where his apparently superior and hothouse intellect saved the day. Instead, a concise but generalised explanation would have done and been illustrative.  Similarly, the book is filled with torturous language and passages absolutely berefit of meaning; for example pg 107 "Now it's time to reflect on how simple TagBuilder is and how easy it is for clients to use. Is there a simpler way to produce XML? This is not the kind of question you can answer right away. Experiments and hours, days, or weeks of reflection can sometimes yield a simpler idea. I'll discuss a simpler implementation in the Variations section below. For now, I move on to the last step. " on page 111 we finally got to the above mentioned Variations section in the interim 40+ references to "I" and "WE".  Finally, the author appears so in love with refactoring and artistic code that I really believed he exceeded good practice and drove towards refactoring to the infinitely useless. Several scattered recomendations to constrain class size to 10 lines of code and recommendations on how do so completed the picture for me. Too many flowers and not enough Vulcan warriors would be a good summary.  Last year, I led a large team in succesfully completing 40 Million Euro of software. (Yes, the sale value as sold to the customers) and commercially, i am not sure I would have a place in my team for such a polarised thinker 
 My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:  First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not bad Quarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he? Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!! Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear! Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!! End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?   I recently saw the trailer and thought "Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset.." It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.   This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 To put it simply, this book stands out in my mind as one of the worst I've ever read. I kept wishing the main character would kill himself just so the book would end. 
 No other entity spread anti-black racism more than the slave industry and Hollywood, and both were and are Jewish run. This claim that Jews put on a black face to work against anti-Jewish sentiment has to be the farthest stretch of Jews justifying their own racism towards blacks that I've read so far, and I've read more than my share. We need to be spending more time on combatting real racism, not a fabricated kind 
 Excellent book.  A simple and proven plan to a financially stable future 
 Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again. Beware 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 So I like the Animal Collective, a lot.  I didn't at first, when all I had heard were the low points of spirit they're gone, but then I heard Sung Tongs and went nuts, it is a great album.  Then I got Panda Bear's album and loved that and have since purchased almost ALL OF THEIR RECORDS and the ONLY ONE THAT DOESN"T STAND UP IS THIS ONE.  It just never comes together the way the others do, it sounds like they are having fun, but I am not.  If you are a completist buy it, but get all the others first.   
 Junk, junk, junk.   Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service.  Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever.  This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website.  We purchased Cuisinart, works great 
 I once again gave wayne dyer a chance and again I try not to sleep as he drones on about magical formulas....and WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE.......Wayne did this Wayne did that...sorry wayne no more Dollars from me......... 
 I was the biggest Spice Girls fan until this came out. I don't know if it was because I grew out of the whole "Girl Power" fiasco or because this is just one disappointing album. Or maybe the magic was just lost without Geri. Whatever it was, this album is a disappointment compared to the girls' first two albums - all the songs sound the same (almost all of them having been produced by Dark Child) and it just gets boring after the third track when the album just gets nowhere. You will be more entertained watching the grass grow instead. Yawn 
 When I bought this book, I wasn't exactly sure what the author's viewpoint would be, but expected a fairly rigorous treatment on the history of church & state issues in America.  I thought this might lead to some meaningful conclusions.  To say the least, I was disappointed.  This is a work which is long on rationalizations, but short on rationale.  Meacham largely sidesteps the critical questions and instead wallpapers over them with anecdotes about the support that presidents and other leaders have given to expressions of "public religion".  He seems to build his whole case out of historical inertia rather than a clear-headed and logical analysis of law.  Meacham points demonstrably toward the fact that presidents have consistently expressed their religious beliefs in public, but completely ignores the reality that those are the kind of people who get elected to national office.  Is someone with strong non-theistic leanings likely to become Commander-In-Chief?  Of course not.  It is important to recognize, however, that this is a bias which is built into the political climate, not the Constitution.  Yes, there is a longstanding history of infusing religion into the public sphere, but this hardly supports the author's contention that it would be impractical for things to be any other way.  He only demonstrates the limits of his imagination and vision.  If he offered a strong case for his views, that would be one thing, but he largely obfuscates the most important questions by offering a collection of stories which really doesn't make much of a point.  In the end, if you're looking for tales about the religious perspectives of various presidents, give this book a read.  The content is hardly riveting, but you may find a few points of interest.  If you want an objective analysis and detailed exploration of the issues which divide our nation on the question of separation of church and state, you won't find it here. 
 I am the FAN in fanatic when it comes to baseball. If there is a book, I read it. If there is a game, I watch it. If Twins's tickets are available, I am there.  This is probably the worse baseball related book I have ever read. I like Will Carroll's column but he should stick with that style of writing but cause his book writing is awful. If you are looking for a book book on baseball or the subject of steroids, this sure ain't it 
 I am very disappointed with this book. I suppose my expectations were raised after seeing that the book was recommended by Dr. Christiane Northrup, M.D., one of my favorite authors, the sole reason I purchased Awakening Intuition.   "Awakening Intution" contains VERY little information concerning how one can develop or awaken his/her intuition. Indeed, the title is misleading and inappropriate. The book is mostly filled with case studies and examples (many tragic) of people who did not deal with emotional issues/thought patterns that subsequently caused disease/illness in their bodies. Mona Lisa focuses on illness  NOT the development of intuition.   I also dislike the author's writing style. While Mona Lisa Schulz does seem to have a healthy sense of humor, I think her writing is nonetheless terribly dry. Mona Lisa Schulz repeats herself throughout the book, which was poorly edited (it should be half as long). The book reads like one long chapter.  Again, rather than discussing intuition and how one can develop this quality, she focuses on her life as a medical student/neuropsychiatrist/neuroscientist and the patient/clients with whom she interacted. After 150 pages I felt sick.  I realize we each have our own tastes and many readers may actually enjoy the book. I, however, would most definitely not recommend this book. 
 Jonathan Franzen is an accomplished writer. However, that doesn't stop this book from being a clunker. Having started and stopped several times, I finally got stuck at page 215 and have not had the energy or willpower to go further. His plot is bizarre and the characters arouse little sympathy; the prose does little to propel you on. I would recommend The Corrections for anyone intrigued by his style but unwilling to take a chance on this early poorly-received work of his 
 I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow 
 What a disappointment.  I cared nothing about the charecters, and the plot never showed up. If you want to read about the government, pick up Clancy 
 I purchased the book in order to find a market regarding the holistic health benefits network for which I sell.  This book enlightens those who are "working for the man" and the reason for sky rocking health cost.  It brings to light the fact that younger people who rarely see the doctor are paying through the nose for older people in their workplace who enjoy unhealthy lifestyles and are addicted to lifestyle drugs. With the current system, as the boomer generation continues to become the largest workforce, the younger generation will burden the cost of workforce health insurance premiums.   The book gives the solution to this situation as purchasing a private policy.  It also indicates how affordable these private policies can be.  However, the author misleads the reader in regards to premium rates and premium increases.  On page 10 and other pages he writes "premiums on most individual/family policies cannot be increased." Guess what, depending upon the health, claims, and cost within that group, the insurance company can and do indeed increase premiums. The author contradicts his own statement on page 20 by saying "Monthly premiums paid for individual policies typically increase annually with the level of inflation or overall medical costs."  The author also indicates in several areas of the book that "good health insurance" for an individual or a family is now only $150.00 to $300.00 per month.  The term "good health insurance" is what to this author?  On page 26, he contends he pays $400.00 a month for a "superdeluxe" family policy for a family of six and he is 51 years of age. He fails to mention his "superdeluxe high deductible."  I also only pay $351.00 a month for a family of four, but my deductible is $2500.00.   The book explains eye-opening standards of what insurance companies are doing such as uprating.  Even the author experienced this situation because of what a doctor wrote about a minor back problem.  However, this author, an experienced insurance salesman (selling mostly for Blue Cross Blue Shield) indicates how he was able to "counteroffer" the increase from his earlier $400.00 a month to $520.00 down to $460.00 a month.  I wonder how many people (not being a broker for Blue Cross Blue Shield could work that out?)    Many parts of the book are an advertisement for Blue Cross Blue Shield, especially since the author offers no solution to those who are uninsurable other than obtaining insurance through a high risk pool of costs upward of $4800.00 a year, only if your state has such an animal. It is interesting that a book titled "The New Health Insurance Solution" would omit a chapter on discount health benefit programs.  If the author used such a discount program with his chiropractor, then his minor back injury would not have been reported to the big "medical computer in the sky" and he wouldn't have been uprated by Blue Cross Blue Shield.  Chapter 10 talks about "How to Be a Smart Healthcare Shopper," but nowhere in the book does he discuss the options available regarding health benefit discount programs (other than a discount prescription card).  "Smart Healthcare Shoppers" are joining the members of companies like Ameriplan, where they receive discounts on the actual costs of their medical care.  Like the discounts similar to those with insurance plans that charge high cost premiums supporting the sick and older people in their insurance pool.  Discount health programs also do not report to the big "medical computer in the sky."  Your health is your business, and you won't be uprated or turned down.  This is the solution for the uninsurable, young families, college students, and healthy people.  In general, this book is hard to read and understand if you do not have a background in the insurance, employee benefits, or medical administration.  The book is technical, misleading, and not for the layman!  However if you do sell a discount health benefits program like Ameriplan, invest in this book as it lays out your target market!

 The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom 
 Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat. 
 I am an academic, but US history is not my field. I wanted to read a good general history of the US from the end of reconstruction to the end of WWI and so I picked up this book. I can't say I much cared for it. It is hard to turn issues like bimetalism and greenbackism into a compelling story, so it is not surprising that Painter falls short. But his obviously leftist account struck me as too biased -- despite the fact that I share his political beliefs. The book attempts to cover a little bit of everything that happened in this period, but ends up feeling more scattered than comprehensive, with very brief one and two page sections on various subjects crowded together in chapters with very little to hold them together. The prose is clear and readable, but hardly elegant and engaging. If you want an engaging general history of this period, I would advise you to look elsewhere 
 This product does not work. PERIOD. I wrote to them for a refund and so far haven't heard back but in fairness that may be because I wrote on Saturday. They also shipped the item in the wrong box. It was a cell phone charger box. This tells me that doing business with these folks for any item is not a smart move especially since given the other reviews they are knowingly shipping a product that does not work at all. 
 Don't waste your money. The illustrations are vague and there are no instructions. Most of the 'positions' could only be acheived by competitive gymnasts and that is doubtful knowing anatomical limitations. Just because you give one position two names doesn't make it two positions.  
 A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.  It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.  Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes 
 I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...  As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?  What a piece of JUNK 
 What a dumb movie,that stupid little skunk killed Ivan.I said to Johannah''Ivan got killed."And she says..."No he did'nt."But Carlita just did that.I really hated this movie!              This movie is sooooooo BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm to mean bout' this.I H8 this junk 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 I forced myself to finish this book. Like other reviewers have said, the characters are very one-dimensional and contrived. I can see Ms. Berg thinking, "Let's see, I need a character/patient who is rich, one who lives in the ghetto, how about an elderly Jewish couple...." etc. etc. If I read one more cliched remark from the character DeWitt I was going to scream!! I doubt I'll read another one of Berg's books. This one won't stay on my shelf for a second read down the road...off it goes to Goodwill. 
 This movie seems very popular with a lot of fans, but I have something different to say. I've seen it, once, when I was about 5 1/2. Maybe adults get a kick out of it, my 10 year old brother (at the time) enjoyed it. So, if you're an older viewer than maybe this movie is good, but please, keep it away from young children. This movie terrified me as a small child and I ran out halfway through nearly in tears. Please, doen't be overly anxious to share this with your kids, it may be best to wait a few years. It is one of the most terrifying memories I have as a little girl and I certainly wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone else 
 I actually bought this book from Amazon awhile ago and just read it.  It took me 3 weeks because I kept putting it down after a few pages.  Boringville.  This was my first Alice Hoffman book and more than likely, my last.  I could not stand the main character.  She deserved to get hit by lightning just because of all the whining about what she thought she did to her mother.   The whole sexual thing with Lazurus wasn't erotic either.  It was just "icky" and uninteresting.   The only interesting person in this story was Ned's wife.  So, to all you fellow reviewers who didn't like it, I'm right there with you 
 The inside dust jacket advises that many will find this book offensive.  I picked it up partially for that reason, and for the supposed plot.   Old manuscripts, Vatican intrigues, Mafioso, black market old book selling... fascinating and fun stuff.    The first chapter is an exercise in using the F bomb as often as humanly possible.  This, in itself, is not that offensive, I liberally sprinkle it through my conversations.  However, it seems forced and contrived.  Louis is a vile, foul-mouthed hit man who seems to enjoy his work too much.  Nothing redeeming here, but that's ok.  He's The Bad Guy (tm).  Then we are introduced to Tosches, who I hope to god is nothing like the character in the book.  If he is, please let me have the opportunity to backhand his egomaniacal misogynistic gob.  So far all women are "b*s and c*s" and seem to exist to be used, tossed aside and to fellate him.  The one bright female light is the daughter he abandoned while she was still in the womb.  He is reunited with her after 15 years and learns the true meaning of love.  I start to think I judged him too quickly and too harshly.  Then he promptly kills her off in an unnamed yet violent death.  So we are back to b*s and bjs.    He spends a page ranting about his disappointment with modern medical spending, resenting the money spent on AIDS and cancer research when Diabetes kills more people.  He has diabetes, as you can guess.  While you want to sympathize, you can't, you wonder why he threw this soapbox in the middle of a story.  His prose, if it isn't biography, drips with self-indulgence and contempt.  It's like reading Hemingway, only hateful.   I am only on page 80, so I have yet to read his diatribe against the publishing industry mentioned by other reviewers.  After reading those reviews I have decided to do what I *never* do - walk away from an unfinished book.  If that's how he feels about the readers and publishers who pay his bills, then he can bite me.  As if his view of women wasn't bad enough, his self-centered, ego-maniacal, self-serving bullcrap pushes it over the edge to not worthy of my time.    I'm not spending my hard-earned money or any more time on you, Tosches. 
 In my opinion this book is too basic and may be suitable for  a  newly appointed technologists. For a professional radiologist who would be looking for a dependable book with good crossectional anatomy, it will not be ideal book to buy 
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
 I would not recomended this book to anyone who is thinking of adoption. I think the women who wrote the book has a lot of issues in her life that she needs to work out. I do believe that a child that is adopted has grief but to say you should tell that child everyday that you are sorry that their birth parents could not take care of them is crazy. I think it would be better for the child if you helped them to feel safe,secured and loved 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 This book is outdated. About all it has of any value is pretty pictures. There are much better books for the beginner out there. I found this out the hard way 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 A Place on Earth is a laborious, read so filled with description and imagined thought processes that the point of the story is never evident.  The character development is not sufficient to entice the reader into really caring for any of the many, many people who wonder through the "Place".  It would be nice if Mr. Berry decided whether to present his ramblings in the past or present tense.  If you are interested in what a valley looked like in Kentucky during World War II, and you have a lot of time to figure out the unnecessarily complex rhetoric, maybe you'll enjoy this book.  If you want a story that invites you to turn to the next page, this ain't the place 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 When I started reading this book I loved it, the first 100pages or so are really funny, in a Bridget Jones kind of way, I was even willing to look beyond the annoying bible verses and letters to God.  I am not a Christian, and being unfamiliar with this faith I just don't get the message there.   Once the main Character's friend Kim gets diagnosed with cancer and eventually gets depressed it is just plain boring.  It feels like having to listen to one of those people who go on and on about their lives  but you just don't care.     Also the bible verses and weird letters to God are getting more and more annoying - hey, I did not sign up for a religious education here -ok.  And, after Whitney gets a cat called Mr. Tibble, several passages are written from the view of the cat - I am also not 6 years old, please, from the view of the cat?  All in all it's a diary of a Christian woman's failed attempts in finding a boyfriend, and in the end she starts seeing Chase,  which is mentioned in the most boring way you can imagine: page 412: " May3: Movie with chase, May4: dinner with chase, May8: walk around Lake Harriet with Chase,  May10: walk, dinner and movie with Chase".  That's it end of book!  Don't have Christians any feelings, emotions and romantic thoughts?  I wish it would have been mentioned clearer on the cover that this is a religious book about the Christian faith and I would have never bought it in the first place 
 When I first started watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that the plot sounded familiar.  Well...the plot is not unlike most romantic comedies or "chick flicks" out there, but the plot was similar to a novel I read a while back but couldn't remember the title at the time.  This is based on the novel Asking for Trouble by Elizabeth Young.  I wasn't impressed with the novel and I have to say that I wasn't impressed with the film either, but for different reasons.  Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) doesn't want to go to her half-sister's wedding in London without a date, for her ex-fiancé is the best man.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and she hires a male escort (Dermot Mulroney) to pass as her boyfriend to make her ex jealous.  Things seem to go well for her and attraction ensues between Kat and Nick, but then she uncovers a terrible secret during the rehearsal dinner.  **This second portion of the review contains spoilers.  Read at your own risk.**  I agree with the people who said this is similar to Pretty Woman and My Best Friend's Wedding, except that this one isn't half as fun or as entertaining as the aforementioned two movies.  In fact, this film is uneven, unamusing and pointless.  The scenes are all over the place.  It appears to be quite poorly edited.  One moment Kat sees Nick as nothing but a tool to make her ex-fiancé jealous and the next thing I know she has a drunken one-night stand with him.  And you know how in some movies, despite its weak plot, the chemistry between the leads is so hot that it doesn't matter that the rest of the film sucks?  Well, you won't find that here.  I felt no heat between these two leads.  Debra Messing is very pretty and she's a great actress, but with the exception of the scene where she confronts her sister her performance is wooden and one-dimensional.  At times I felt she was playing Grace Adler from Will and Grace all over again.  And Dermot Mulroney is gorgeous and I enjoyed getting an eyeful of his great bod, but his role could've been played by Hugh Jackman, Matthew McConaughey or any other romantic comedy poster boy.  Nothing stood out from this character.  The Wedding Date is populated by unlikeable characters who get away with the disgusting things they do.  Ugh.  The only good things about this film is Jack Davenport (whose character is kind of a dork, but is about one of the very few likeable characters here), the lovely scenes filmed in England's Lake District and the awesome soundtrack.  This film contains some wonderful songs.  Other than that, this is a waste of time.  I can't believe I bought this previewed at a DVD rental. I won't buy a film like this before watching it first again.  Thank goodness I've finally joined Netflix. 
 I purchased this book hoping to get a fresh perspective - why do people choose a suburban lifestyle and how that shapes society. Instead, I got 275+ pages of the same elitest criticism.  It's important to understand what the author is describing as suburb vs. city. I picked this up expecting to find a NY vs. Levvitown or Chicago vs. Park Forest argument. It seems that the "cities" in this book are not your major metropolitan areas, but smaller cities, around 250,000 in population or so. When you read on, you'll see why he is concentrating on these examples - all of his cities' "haves" and the suburbs "have nots" would be shattered when applied to Manhattan.   Next issue I take with the book is that there are a lot of claims made, but not a shred of data to back them up! I agree with a lot of the points that he is trying to make, but if you can't solidify your argument with some statistics (and they are out there for this sort of research), then your book is nothing more than an opinion and rhetoric. One example was that there is much more socio-economic diversity in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC and that the secretaries and teachers live alongside the lawyers. If Mr. Duany were to pull up the socio-economic data from a Georgetown zip code (and this information is readily available, I just found it on google), he would see that this is most certainly not true. As another reviewer pointed out, just stating it does not make is so.  Finally, one of the other shortcomings in the book were the photos and the footnotes that contradict the argument. An example is a discussion of how a main street shopping district is superior because nobody needs to drive - they can walk home, to work, to shop, and to play. All garage space is provided in alleys, creating the author's version of utopia. But if this is true, then why is the accompanying photo showing a main street in Boca Raton that has not one open parking spot? Seems that this isn't quite the utopia that he is painting, and people still are driving, regardless if it is to get home, shop, to go to work, etc. There are also some points made in footnotes, which I passed over at first thinking that they were just citations. Turns out that sometimes they are counterpoints, that if he had added in the regular paragraph, would have destroyed his point. Come on now, that is just silly. If you have to conceed a point that weakens the argument, don't insult the intelligence of your audience by trying to hide it.  While this is a fascinating topic to me, I have to say that this is a very narrow-minded view that is lacking on anything concrete or even original 
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 An amusing guide to some of the rudest slang in the language.  Useful in a practical sense only if Indonesian speakers are among your closes friends, or if you're happily acquiring a potentially offensive or troublemaking  vocabulary in Bahasa Indonesia.  My Indonesian speaking friends were the  ones who got the biggest laugh out of it, but unless you've already got a  good grasp of the language and the culture, beware utilizing most of the  vocabulary in this book.. 
 I read On the Road over 30 years ago in college. I was hooked and within two years I read everything JK had written. I bought a first edition of Visions Of Cody some years later and found it a monumental bore. While I'll nod to the readers that get off on the experimental nature of the prose, for someone like me, who thinks On The Road and The Dharma Bums are almost perfect, Cody is not much more than the rough cut...very rough...for On The Road 
 If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be  terrible. It can never be as good as the original.  Also Snoop Dogg screwes  up in Gangsta Gangst 
 I adore Ishiguro.  I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day.  Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous.  I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled.  I confess, I read to enjoy myself.  I have a degree in English literature.  I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all 
 COB from 97-03 were geniuses... it was such a fresh sound   but now, they decided that sounding like techno and playing SLOW is cool.  lame lame lame.  Stick with the first 4 albums.. k thanks bye 
 see my review for the blue of this- i own the re 
 My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious. 
 I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870. I've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it's fine. My husband dropped the "rugged" phone once and the antenna, which sticks out like a thumb, snapped off.  Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan, regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards. What army? DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! (unless of course, you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 The subject matter is utterly fascinating yet the author has achieved something that is usually hard to do: take a rich and fascinating history of a strange and amazing cult, then bog its story down in tedious and annoying narrative. In otherwords, he may be a good researcher, but as a writer he's piss-poor. WE, the layman public, want to read an account of the Assassin Order, not petty details interlaced with utterly droll wordsmithing.  Goes to show you that whomever published this had their head up their ass. I'm very disappointed. Bypass this one!  
 Taking the lead of her brother Logan, Grace Montgomery rejects her family's wealth and lives her life in Manhattan as a regular gal. When her job takes her into some pretty rough neighborhoods, meddlesome grandma Emma is concerned and hires a PI to keep an eye on her. Ben takes the apartment next door and soon has more than his eyes on her. As he accompanies her on her excursions, and happen upon a bit of mystery, the two grow closer together. Grace is just happy that she has found a regular guy to love her for who she is, not because of  her family's wealth. But when Grace finds out the truth about Ben, will she walk away?  The last in the "Simply" series proves that sometimes authors should quit while they are ahead. Yes, the requisite steam is there, but the plot is so recycled and loaded with so much trite dialogue, it was hard to get through at times. It was a bit of a disappointment 
     I got this book on remainder, very cheap. It was not worth what I paid for it tho.     This was quickly written..or ghost written...by Larry Garrison and his sister Stephanie Good.     It is poorly written and hard to follow. There are no specifics, and much speculation. Things seem to be thrown into the mix simply for "sensationalism"     There are some passages that seem to show real emotion from Dave and this is sad. However, the book was totally premature, written much too quickly. Even since it's publication various new events and things occurred and it was out of date the day it came out since there has been no real resolution to this case.     Why did he write it so soon? It seems to be thrown together. The "Shango" stuff is pretty silly too, since those poems and stuff were on the web for months and were pretty much discredited. That was a prank not some real "cult" LOL    Sad book altogether and not worth the time 
 Do NOT read any Nancy Drew books! They're boring and girly. If you want a real mystery, read a good one like Chasing Vermeer or The Witches of Worm. THIS BOOK IS SO STUPID, I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE LIKES IT!!! 
 I adore Katherine Forrest's mysteries and Curious Wine is simply exquisite and I'm an SF fan, so it seemed like this would be a perfect match, but I'm afraid to say this novel was very disappointing. It felt very dated and cliche. The story moved at an insane speed with little or no support for some jumps of plot and logic. A good SF novel uses the alternative setting to free readers from expectations, but needs to have a logic in and of itself, but this felt like the SF backdrop was an excuse for implausable deus ex machina jumps in the plot. Very much "it doesn't have to make sense, it's SF." Still, this is a classic of lesbian feminist utopian fiction and it was worth reading on that level 
 I belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially Universities, a little too much.  In the beginning when he makes this assertion that Universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few African Americans in the Universities that they are  racist or something like that.  Furthmore since the Military has more  African Americans it is a better instiution.  Here is a better explanation.   Universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  The Army will take anyone it can get its hands on. I just did  not like the Authors atitutde that the whole is racist. Furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  I love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses Heavy Metal and Rock n Roll, both  white music!  In fact Heavy Metal is white protest music against Black  music!  Do some research or think before writting a book 
 I don't normally writereviews...but this book is bad !  every second sentance is "Clinton-Gore Administration" did this or that wrong.  It is just 200 pages of Clinton bashing - nothing more.  Also it is very poorly written - a Pulitzer Prize this author will never receive.  
 I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first. 
 Imposible to do so with no item received 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 This album sucks horribly.  I will admit that Medicate and You've Changed are phenomenal, but the rest of the album sucks...HARD!  Flaw is from my hometown in Louisville, KY so I bought this to support the local music and because I've heard them enough to know how awesome they are.  They're first album was great, but this one is terrible.  Every song except the two I mentioned are soft (and FLAW used to be a hardcore band when they were in the local scene), so it doesn't even sound like them.  I wish they would have just gave up before this album.  However, Five.Bolt.Main (ex-FLAW vocalist Chris Volz's new band) just released an album today and it is everything I had hoped this album would be.  So if you want a good album, go pick that up.  If you want a crappy album, buy this one 
 This story seemed to skip from one subject to the next, although it made a little sense at times.  I cannot understand how this family can function in everyday life, let alone be music stars!  Unreal 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 Except for "Till You Love Me" (which even though is a good song is still overdone), the rest of this album is really, really bad.  The worst two songs on here are "I Wouldn't Wanna Be You" and "I Won't Stand In Line".  Her big hits "THe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" (which is a pop song through and through and "And Still" an o.k. ballad but nothing to compare with "For My Broken Heart" or "You Really Better Love Me After This" (her crowning performance in my opinion from her Behind the Scene album on Mercury)are on here but they aren't worth the time.  If you like pop rhythms and sounds, this is the album for you!!  If you want straight ahead country you'd better look somewhere else.

 It's been quite some time since I read this book, and my tastes in languages have changed quite a bit since then, so it's possible that if I read this book today, I would have a different impression. However, I am doubtful that that would be the case, and as it stands, my memories of this book leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  The joke goes that "some programmers can write C/Fortran code in any language," and that is exactly the problem with this book. The compiler implemented within may compile correctly under javac, but it isn't implemented in a modular, object oriented way like one might expect when using such a language. Rather, the author seems to often use classes as little more than C structs, and methods as merely convenient ways of grouping together functions. I see now that the author also has a book on C compilers, and it wouldn't surprise me if the code herein was a direct port to Java, with as little redesign as possible.  I am certainly not an expert on compilers, and as I said, it's been quite some time since I read this book. The general information on compiling in this book might be useful, and I'll leave it to other people to make comments on that. However, if you are looking for a book that gives advice on what patterns work well when developing compilers, or what advantages an object oriented language might bring to the table in that arena, this is not the book you're looking for. This might teach you how to write a compiler that is, syntactically, Java, but it won't give you any insight on why you'd want to use Java over any other language 
 I hate this CD. I should sell it. No, I should give it away! Does anyone want a free Von Bondies CD 
 I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and King's collaboration with Straub on "The Talisman" was so terrific that I was compelled to try Straub. At best, I hoped to find another author who could weave humanity and the creeps together with King's masterful abilities. Unfortunately, I found "Ghost Story" to be the worst case scenario-- a book that shattered my high hopes and left me grasping for explanations as to how the same mind could have produced both this and The Talisman.  It's too harsh to say that Straub is a bad writer. In fact, I really love some of his prose, and the descriptive phrases that he uses to scare up some shivers are top notch.  But Straub applies these good writing skills to a mediocre plot, positively hackneyed characters, and a story with questioanble ethics.   The plot is not terrible, involving the resurfacing of a terrible evil among five childhood friends. Their struggles to stay alive and one step ahead of the monstrous demons dominate the length of the book.   The pacing is pretty good, with lots of action, scary setups, and cliffhangers that compel you to read just one more chapter.  However, there's nothing in the books strengths that come close to making up for the outlandish, cartoonish characters; the protagonists are insufferable and, considering their "I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer" actions, not particularly deserving of our sympathy.  Everything about the characters rings false for me, beginning with the over-the-top seriousness of "The Chowder Society" (where they discuss death at length, but implausibly avoid the topic of their deadly deed for decades).   The ponderous and pompous Sears is particularly grating; he seems to have crawled out from a terrible episode of "Murder, She Wrote," and sustaining him over the course of a novel pokes about a million holes into his believability.  The dialogue, the special reverence that the characters accord SO MANY things, and the motivations are all suspect. As a result, it's hard to care about what will happen to them, and that brings the whole enterprise to a groaning halt.  Well, this has turned into quite a little rant, but you can take that as a measure of my disappointment. It may be that Straub has struck a balance in other novels that works, but if you're a King fan looking for King-esque writing, don't turn to Ghost Story 
 Navy airplanes. Viet Nam. Minor love interest. This one stuck pretty close to form for the genre. It started off a little bit slow, and the technical details were overemphasized a bit. Overall it isn't a book I'll remember a month from now 
 Was really disappointed with this album. He needs to find something new that has the zip of Vincent, Crying  & American Pie. Old artists may need to just fade away if they are just a bunch of old men strumming boring new stuff. Bought this album because of the 3 songs that I mentioned. None of the rest made me want to listen more than once. 
 A lot of people write about this book saying that it is one book that should always be a classic and important work. I guess I agree to that in one aspect. This is the story of a woman who was a victim of a Japanese death march that happened in Malaysia during WWII. It's basically her story about how she survived and how she meet this man named Joe whom she fell in love with and how because she aquired some money, she was able to change the lives of the Malay people who helped her during the war years and then the lives of the Aussie's in the outback. There's more to it but I didn't like this book very much.   It does write about a true account of what the Japanese did during the war but because of the way that Nevil Shute wrote about the account and the "Great Jean" who made everyone's lives better--- it just didn't get to me. There is absolutely no heart in this story at all. I did not get to know the characters at all. It's like they are all cardboard cutouts of how people should act and should talk and should behave during that time. It really pissed me off. And I could not stand the main characters' blatant racism towards the Aboriginese. I guess it was accepted during that time that the "Abo" was an outcast but come on now. I couldn't stand it anymore. Aboriginese faced the same problems as blacks in South Africa and our own problems in the south during the Civil Rights Movement and the Native American struggle. I've never read a book with so much slang about the Aboriginese. Whatever. I mean, here is Jean, the hero, the ultra feminist. She decides to make an ice cream shop in the outback so everyone can enjoy ice cream. But what does she do? To her "Everyone" only means the white australians. She instead makes a seperate shop to the side for the "Abo's" who aren't welcome. She makes a segregated icecream shop. And this is the woman that wanted to be treated equally during her time of struggle? There were other incidents and it's probably because I'm thinking of this stuff as if it happened now and not during the time when that kind of racism is shamefully accepted. But that is not an excuse. If Jean was such a hero she should make a difference in race and not make the original Australians outcasts and calling them "Boogs". Reading this book I wonder why people like it so much. The history of it is true I guess but one I am not familiar with, but what good is a book when the characters are false. Not one minute did I believe the Jean or Joe character. They were just names on a page and did not come to life to me at all. Nothing they did seemed real. Like I said, just cardboard cutouts. Everyone it seems love this book but I did not find it one bit endearing. "A love story?" No way.  
 Having read the first 3 Women's Murder Club books, this fourth in the series didn't even come close to the previously set standard.  The two unrelated story lines felt gimmicky, but would've been tolerable if each of the plots had been better designed. The court scenes needed to be better researched.  Look, I'm NOT a lawyer, but even I know that civil court is different.  And I also know enough about procedures to know you don't do any "I Object!"s during opening statements.  And by the way, can you even sue a cop for doing her job?  Don't you have to sue the city, and/or the Police Department?  And on, and on.  I don't know if James Patterson or Maxine Paetro wrote that part of the book, but his/her/their ignorance was pretty glaring. As to the serial murders, that wasn't bad, but it felt like this story line was simply tacked on and hurriedly resolved - not very satisfying. And finally, this wasn't a Women's Murder Club mystery.  It was a Lindsay Boxer mystery.  The other club members had cameo roles and zero participation in the crime solving 
 The acting and writing is atrocious and I was dumbfounded that some people would rate this movie highly.  The little brother's spoken parts are so British it is laughable and the hero, his brother, has a Scandanavian accent. The main character is no actor and it is embarrassing at times listening to him and watching him. The whole movie is so contrived and corny I gave up watching it more than halfway through. Just because it is based on a real character doesn't make it a good, or watchable movie 
 Foods are conveniently organized alphabetically, but portions are not clear so it's difficult to use when trying to track calories.  Example, grapefruit shown by size (diameter) - would be more accurate and convenient if all foods were shown in ounces and if the portion preceded nutritional content on every line 
 I got that title after to have read the generally very good reviews. I was however quite disappointed by this movie, its average plot, average acting (especially "Mark") and rather clich ending 
 This book is total waste of time and money... I think the purpose is not giving insights about how to make a business, how to fund it... If you want to learn something about start-ups and how to finance them... Go and buy Lightspeed Business... Do not waste your time with this book.. 
 Have you played any of the games in the Doom series?  How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye?  Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same.  I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious.  The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme, utterly mundane, unoriginal, boring and just all around unentertaining.  The gameplay is so generic that it's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer, the music is cliche, the voice acting is flat, and Master Chief is just an all around retard.  The weapons, oh boy, the weapons, again another lame aspect of the game.  The alien's weapons are like something in the kid's "toy gun" section from Toys R Us, and the human guns are nothing that I haven't used in a Resident Evil game.  When the first Halo came out I didn't get the big deal, I didn't even play it, then eventually I got myself an X-Box, and decided to give this installment a shot - huge mistake.  Come to think of it none of the games of X-box are even worth owning a system for: Fable was decent, but got old after beating it a few times, The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring, and everything else on X-Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube 
 Leveen's book is much like the products he is famous for: slight, expensive, and possibly overblown.  Which isn't to say there aren't kernels of knowledge one can derive from the book.  Unlike many Levenger products, the book is about achieving a deeper relationship with reading and not about looking good while doing it.  To achieve a well-read life, Leveen suggests that you 1) make a list of books you want to read and keep them in categories (Leveen is fairly insistent that you buy the books you want to read - he obviously hasn't considered how expensive that might be); 2) practice the SQ3R method (survey, question, read, recite, review) and preferably write in your books; consider audio books as an addition to, but not replacement of, "reading"; join a reading group.  And that's the book in a nutshell.  There are no a-ha moments unless you're one of those people who doesn't believe in audiobooks, and shame on you if you are.  There is little here that anyone who has ever asked him or herself the question "how can I read more?" hasn't already considered.  In fact, the book made me a little uneasy for two reasons.  First, Leveen's overwhelming need to "possess" books he has or might want to read.  There is little discussion of public libraries and the value they provide to those who cannot afford personal libraries.  Second, Leveen's insistence that writing in one's books is important.  Yes, such an activity can improve one's understanding of the book, but frequently one can't write in a book (library) or would prefer not to (expensive/valuable, such as a first edition).  Writing marginalia is often not nearly as effective as taking real notes 
 this is entertainment? Wow, exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat 
 Ms. Schreier requested that her internet group write a positive review of her book with the promise of a free pattern.  The book has really good ideas, and with the help of my local yarn shop I was able to knit the zigzag scarf.  The instructions in the book have errors.  Most of group member seems to be requesting help for the same errors.  One would think she would write corrections to her book.  When I contacted Ms Schreier I was told her instructions were correct and I should join her group.  I would buy the book only if you can get help from your local yarn store or you have been knitting a very long time.  
 I ordered the book thinking that I had found a good resource for starting  my event planning business.  What I received was a book that would be great  for people who organize fund raising events with several committees of  people working together.  Not at all what I was looking for.  In fact, most  of the book is related to fundraising and the responsibilities of the  various committee members.  Overall, I was disappointed in the lack of  general event planning information and ideas 
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 I don't like this stupid book! It only teaches kids that "strangers" are bad people that wanna hurt you for fun, and the only "nice" people are the people you know. A kid in my brother's kindergarten class was too afaid to leave his house because of this book. They should of changed the title to "The Berenstain Bears Learn About Demented Killing Strangers. 
 My husband, who has difficulty hearing, and I tried to watch the first episode and couldn't because the sound was not very clear.  These tapes DO NOT have closed caption so we had to sell them before we were able to watch them.  It even seemed to me, and I have excellent hearing, that the sound wasn't that great.  
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 Manji's book had the potential of addressing the real issues that Muslims recognize are plaguing Islam today.  Instead she alienates her intended audience (Muslims), not by posing tough questions about the crisis our religion is facing, but by making a mockery of our core beliefs (the Quran and Muhammad PBUH).  Manji's intense and raw distaste of Islam is so clearly laid out in the pages of her book that I wonder if a reform will be sufficient and if there will be anything recognizable left of the religion after she is through reforming it.  To all the non-Muslims that read this book and proclaim it brilliant because Manji calls for Islam's reform, I say: the real problem is not Islam, it is MUSLIMS, Muslims who interpret Islam as they see fit and try to use it as justification for their own whims (terrorism case in point).  It is unfortunate that instead of providing us with guidance to truly help us, Manji strives to enrage us.  
 A silly and paranoid book of yet another Christian who fails to understand the theology of his own religion and its connection and spiritual ties with the Hebrew tradition 
 Jodie Foster Is one of the Greatest Actress's Ever period,but this clunky film is so boring&Predictable that it just never gets off the ground&put me to sleep. a film full of Cliches&dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere 
 I took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and I have been into thrillers lately. So, I tried it.  The scenery was terrific, the setup had lots of promise, and the cinematography was eerie.  So, what went wrong?  Easy.... the plot was empty and as others have stated, nothing ever really came of anything.  There were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing.  Again, great camera work and the building was truly creepy.... but thats not what makes a great thriller. You have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any.  And the characters....Uggggh!  The film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them I would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow, painful way.    Go ahead and try it if you'd like but I suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices. Ultimately, it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters. Its not the worst I've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour.  Not recommended 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.  Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.  The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last 
 The quality of this key case is not up to par.  While leather and snap closure for the case is good, my keys will not stay attached.  The portion of the key case that a key attaches to pulls off the key case often while driving or when I first open up the key case 
 I seem to be in the minority when it comes the worth of Timelies Face.  Timelies was a typo error but I have decided to leave it because it about sums up this book 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it

 About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.  In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.  If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.  How important are your pictures to you?   Frederic 
 There soon will be published a four-page review of this book, by my hand, in the journal 'Vigiliae Christianae'.  What follows here, is the summary of that review : 	Louth's 'Maximus the Confessor' wants to provide an  introduction to the theological thinking of Maximus the Confessor, a goal  the author hopes to achieve by providing translations of some of Maximus'  major theological treatises, especially 'Ambigua ad Thomam' and 'Ambigua ad  Johannem'. 	Although both the editor of the series 'The Early Church  Fathers' and Louth himself stress the necessity of an accessible modern  translation of "key texts by the major Fathers", Louth's  translation of Maximus leaves a lot to be desired. 	First of all, his  negligent treatment of the original Greek text has been the cause of a  number of annoying mistakes in the translations.  In more than one case,  these mistakes even twist Maximus' theology in a way the Confessor himself  would not have agreed upon. 	It is hard to believe that the author of  this kind of translations has been able to provide such a sound and correct  introduction to them.  However, it goes without saying that the real  sources for further study of Maximus' thinking, i.e., the Confessor's  works, have not become more accessible by this edition.  On the contrary,  the numerous inaccuracies and definite errors in the translations might in  the future result in some strange conclusions about Maximus' theological  thinking 
 I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful.  It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.    The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character.  The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives.  I therefore had no idea who the "hero" of this novel was supposed to be.  To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.  If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead.     
 I don't care about "the artist's intent" in this instance...the UK version of this album is vastly inferior to the U.S. release. I pined for years and years to get the U.S. "Mr. Fantasy" on CD, and my wait was finally rewarded a few years back with the reissue entitled "Heaven Is in Your Mind" (which was the original title of the U.S. release of this album...I've actually seen a copy so-titled on LP, though "Mr. Fantasy" was the more common release).  Never mind that this one has "Paper Sun" as a bonus track...the U.S. version leads off with it and has a much more sensible sequence overall, and the reissue puts the duff tracks from the UK version (e.g. "Utterly Simple") at the end where they can be avoided.  The only virtue this release would have would be the mono mixes, which are probably quite different from the stereo ones as was so often the case in those days.  This has always been one of my favorite albums of all time, but as Stevie says in "Smiling Phases," "Do yourself a favor"...get the U.S. one 
 Don't bother with the set...workout one is difficult to follow, the cues are late or non-existent.  Workout 2 is much better...a more comprehensive workout. I suggest buying just workout  
 I found this C.D. to be horrible mainly becuase she just doesn't have the voice and is not ready to be a singer quite yet. Maybe in the future she will be better, but right now she needs a lot of practic 
 I read the book Heart of Darkness as a sophomore in high school and it was a very challenging book.  The book is very hard to understand and you will learn how to read between the lines if you don't already.  Joseph Conrad uses symbolism to show events and try to "spice" things up, but I could never grasp at those thoughts, unless someone pointed them out to me and then explained them to me.  You should not read this book unless you love learning about history and events that lead to great movies or reading about someone telling you a story.  Marlow is telling the readers a story throughout the book but he switches from him telling the story to dialogue between people, which can be confusing to keep up.  Overall, I did not like this book.  I would only recommend it to people who like history or people who usually like books that take an acquired taste.  I would not recommend this book to my friends because some of them may feel smarter after they read it and some may feel like complete idiots because they were so confused while reading this highly valued book.  
 This was hardly a diet book, rather it is an infomercial posing as literature.  Every other sentence seems to be about the virtues not of the diet but of a specific product.  Macademia Nut Oil, and not just any generic macadamia nut oil but instead only one specific brand.  Not too surprisingly other reviewers have indicated that the good doctor apparently is the owner of the company.  I can't believe the positive reviews here, they had to be posted by someone in the author's employment.  This book was such an insult to anyone with intelligence.  Another reviewer refered to the author as a SNAKE OIL salesman and I highly agree.  Please save your time and money and don't buy this book 
 This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring  and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.   But as a mom, who has time for this?   Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here.   This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.   Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"!  I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 This DVD is a waste. They should've included Jermaine Jackson's  music video Closest Thing To Perfect. I read somewhere else online that  Jamie Lee Curtis was in the video. When they bring these movies on DVD, they need to  include extras like the music videos off the soundtracks. I don't understand why some do and others don't. Some company executives just don't know what they're doing. Don't waste your money on this DVD with no extras.  Scott  
 I had this phone for 3 days before sending it back. It added some very slight static to the calls. To make sure it was not my line causing it, I plugged it directly into the wall at various points around the house, and I could hear the static even when it was not plugged into the phone jack. I think some people may not hear this or be this picky, but it was not that good for outgoing quality either. People on the other end told me I sounded a bit metallic when I switched between old and new phone and let them do an A-B comparison. 
 It could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails. Not fully invisible 
 At first glance this is an attractive book, with a high standard of graphic design and a profusion of color illustrations. Working with it unfortunately reveals a number of annoyances. First, the organization is chaotic, with topics showing up in unexpected places. Among many examples, Chapter 1 purports to introduce PSP's features, but includes redundant and superficial sections on choosing a digital camera and computer. Chapter 3 deals with basic picture manipulation, but leaps into a discussion of scripting (which probably deserves a separate chapter). The various levels of chapter subheadings use very similar type, so it's hard to discern the structure of the book. Some topics are covered in the main body of the text, but others are only found in separate "step-by-step projects", which seem to be an attempt at exercises for the reader. Another complaint is the huge number of screen shots that are simply too small to read. And the before and after examples of image adjustments are so small that it is often impossible to see the differences. The book covers a lot of material that is obvious simply by looking at PSP's user interface, yet some important topics get short shrift. For example, the issue of color management. I couldn't find an answer to the common workflow question: "What is the best sequence to apply the many functions provided by PSP?" The authors are obviously qualified to provide some insights here. There is some good material in the book, but with some attention to organization and space priorities, it could have been much better 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times 
 When I order this book I hope a very good Bond book with great pictures. But it was very disappointing. The all black and white pictures look old and some have bad quality. You may think that of course a picture form the movie Goldfinger must look old because it's a movie from the early sixties but, you know what I mean. I have seen pictures from Thunderball and other movies in full color and look spectacular but not in this book. And much of the info seems like "I don't care at all about this fact" Anyway, if you are a very big Bond fan, you should try this one, but if you don't, forget it immediately. 
 i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  I used the entire container and saw no benefit!! 
 tHE SHOWING OF dORA GOES TO A BLACK SCREEN SHORTLY INTO THE SCREENING.  tHIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.  i WILL NEVER DOWNLOAD UNBOXED ITEMS AGAIN AS THEY ARE NOT GOOD QUALITY.  dON'T EVEN BOTHER.  JUST BUY THE dvd 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 In the wake of corporate scandals, David Callahan decided to look into cheating in America.  What he discovered was the cheating has become part of our social structure. He attributes this to the intense pressure that society puts on us to succeed.  Since many high profile people cheat and are not caught (and if they do the penalty is low), many other people begin to cheat because they feel that they have to stay at the same level as others.  This causes cheating behavior to "trickle-down" until it almost become socially acceptable.  He even mentions how people begin to cheat at a young age in school, and when they do not get caught, they continue to cheat throughout their lives because they see the benefits are greater than the chance of getting caught and being punished.  Additionally, he says how many people cheat even when they do not recognize their behavior as cheating, such as when they steal cable or download music for free.  This book is based on a good idea, and Callahan does give many real world examples.  The major downfall of the book is that with every example he reaches the same conclusion, which is more or less, what I described above.  After reading this for a couple hundred pages, it becomes redundant and mind numbing.  By the time you reach the chapter on how to solve the problem, you already know what his solution is because he repeats it throughout the book.  I feel that this book would have been a lot better if it were only half as long.   
 I had so many bad burns with my first spindle that I had to ask for an exchange.  The new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too.  Also, the edge of the disc wasn't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside.  Never again will I buy Memorex discs DVD, CD or otherwise 
 The paper stripes of 1/4" are too wide. at times Information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear. IF somebody is really after information he shouldn't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper 
 Barron's should be ashamed of themselves, foisting a language workbook with no answers in it on an unsuspecting public. Because it's impossible to check if your answers are right or wrong, this book is totally useless for self-learners. Should be sold only with a giant sticker on the cover stating: "WARNING! NO ANSWERS PROVIDED". Blurbs about the book on web sites (are you listening, Amazon?) should not fail to state the same. Then at least people would know what they are, and are not, getting. Heartily NOT recommended 
 I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift 
 This book may be good for some, however it is misleading in the description. I was led to beleive that this book was in fact comic book coversations to help explain simple situations to my child with Autism. Instead, you have to write your own comic strips to do the explaining. Not worth the book in my opinion if it is still up to me to do all the work, I already do that without this book 
 A. S. Byatt's work can be excellent. Her short stories are really marvelous, and "Possession" was a wonder - full of life and characters and plot. In the series that is capped by this novel, I continue to find "The Virgin in the Garden" an outstanding work and "Still Life" quite remarkable. However, "A Whistling Woman" is too large, it covers too many topics, too much history and too much science (done without any spirit) and too many stories. The period explored by the novel certainly encompassed all these things, but why did the novel try to do the same. Should not the novelist sift through and bring forth something that crystallizes the period, rather than load the reader with details and leave us wondering at the end why we plowed through such a "big" book only to find a clueless, pregnant Frederica. The work loses focus, flattens characters and in the end finishes rather lamely - dead characters either we hardly knew or from whom we expected more; live characters who have disappeared into clichs, and romances that even the author seems reluctant to accept. I have to admit, the energy of the 60s does seem to have ended in pregnant 70s girls in Laura Ashley dresses, but I do think that Byatt should have left this novel to sit for awhile, and come back to it after a little reflection, crafting a finer piece, which her readers deserve. Let's hope now that Byatt has the series behind her, she will be freed to write a more wonderful work 
 It's an entertaining book, it's a pity that the author has appearently done his research at 'Something Somebody Said Once University'.  The number of history blunders, plain falsehoods, and misinterpetations is staggering. It's a shame, because Mr. Allen has a great style. Not reccomended at all, I'm afraid 
 I had a problem when I first used it. Sony support suggested buying different DVD's, but still no luck recording more than 20 seconds, finally got a Sony tech who knew it needed repairing or replacing. After much time and expense shipping and more phone calls, it was replaced. Worked okay for about a year One year later, after warranty is up, it doesn't work again. I  would not recommend this unit. Software is slow and remote is lousy too. Only can do one hour of high quality at this point in technology.  I would wait another year before investing in a DVD recorder 
  I bought this book after reading Caroline Rey say male orgasm is inferior to female multiple orgasms in "The Mammoth Book of Love and Sensuality". "The Multi-Orgasmic Man" has similiar views, and says that ejaculation is a pitiful 5-second experience that leaves a man feeling exhausted. The book claims it will teach a man how to have multiple orgasms without ejaculation. It claims that these techniques come from the East. Please keep in mind that China has a population of over a billion people, and India also has a population of over a billion people. So, it is clearly a myth that Eastern men withhold ejaculation. I practiced the techniques in this book for six months. The stamina techniques were effective for me, but I never experienced multiple orgasms. I've come to learn that once is enough. If it's not broke, why fix it? There's nothing wrong with the male orgasm. If the male orgasm is only 5 seconds, that's long enough. If men can only have one orgasm at a time, that's okay. Even that exhaustion a man feels after coming is not a bad thing, it relieves his stress and relaxes him. I do not feel male orgasm is inferior to female multiple orgasms, I feel it is only different. Yes, men need to be aware of women's needs. But nobody should be so cruel to a man. The best advice I've heard to satisfy a woman, is to start by giving her a good massage. A woman's body is errogenous and deserves to be stimulated. Then stimulate her clitoris and g-spot with your hands and mouth. It takes the average woman a half hour to begin having her multiple orgasms. So, if you are uncertain about your stamina, spend more time stimulating her with your hands and mouth. It is important for a woman to tell a man what she needs. The ancient Greeks felt it was a woman's fault for her sexual frustration if she did not tell her man what she needed. After a woman is satisfied it is time to focus on his needs. Most men want to recieve oral sex. Most men would also enjoy to recieve a good massage. A man's body is also errogenous, and deserves to be stimulated. There is better advice on sex than what "The Multi-Orgasmic Man" has to offer.   
 Two stars is an exaggeration.  I was surprised that this music did not comprise of anything which stuck with me.  It was way too unstructured for my listening pleasure.  I do not mind when musicians go into the studio/session without any preconceived ideas or even framework for the songs (LTE, Bozzio, Levin & Stevens, & Attention Deficit are all examples of pure genius for an outcome w/o having things written or rehearsed prior to).  The actual sound of the guitar almost sounds like an additional saxaphone at times.  Some of the musicianship is worthy.  Yet I am now looking to get rid of the CD I purchased (and that is saying a lot) 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 Given the relative neglect of Mary Magdalene by the orthodox Church, her role for the Cathars, and given that this gospel's text intrigues me, a helpful commentary of this Gospel would be welcome.   It's not this one: the commentary is mostly LeLoup's advice, not particularly gnostic and not focused so much on this gospel. There seems to be little attention to any relevant conditions of the times when the Gospel was written. At times the commentary sounds like pop psychology. I'm afraid I didn't learn anything from Leloup's commentary.   Fortunely, an outstanding commentary on the Gospel of Mary exists: "The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the Woman Apostle" by Karen King of Harvard Divinity School 
 Oone of the worst books I've started reading in quite a while. I didn't finish. How did this become a best seller? He shouts "look at how funny I am" and he's not. He shouts "look how strange and/or incompetent and/or incomprehensible the French are" without convincing me -- he's just another slagging Brit whingeing Pom. He also brags about all the girls he shags, and I don't care. It is, to go for the obvious here, merde 
 This shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower, but that's about it.  The shave isn't very close, and it takes a long time to shave.  To do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor 
 This book is very well laid out, and points out both sides of the arguments. Very good for seeing what one side says to one issue, and what the other side says to the same. However, some issues are touchy, inerrancy being one.  Page 146 "the Bible is a  trustworthy communication by Spirit-guided interpreters and is true in all it intends to teach." The Bible was not given to men to teach them science, but the God of Science is the God of the Bible - If the Holy Spirit is the author of the text and He errs in some matter (in this case of science) then God is not God.  B.B. Warfield, whom they quote for the "conservative" position, is right. Go get a copy of Revelation and Inspiration, Oxford Press, 1927. Still the best. I am very concerned with how they also handle the Holy Spirit. While they acknowledge His place in the writing of the Bible, all I seem to read about is what did the author on earth mean? I see precious little to help one understand the place of the Holy Spirit upon the authors, except for a bit here and a dash there. How about what does the Bible say? Could we please get to that? I really do wish more biblical texts were quoted.  I am WELL aware many interpretations exist, but this does not negate the fact that we cannot deny the singular purpose of The Scriptures as the revelation of Jesus Christ. Yet, the reader feels lost on this point, and that could also be due to the fact that this book clearly needs an editor. As a humanities major, I went through line by line, and condensed almost 70-80% of the sentences. No appendx for terms, and a cursory index of subjects - I am disappointed that Nelson would let something like that slide especially when this book is used in higher education. It is a good book. Well researched. Covers both sides of an issue. Points the reader in the right direction. Helpful for the foundations of hermeneutics. Footnotes as far as the eye can see. But better exist. Can be improved - all hope is not lost -but a drawing board will be needed. 
 I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered.   I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.  If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there. 
 This book is terrible!!! I was forced to read this book for summer reading and definitley did not enjoy it, dont waste the 14 bucks to buy this piece of junk. I really hated this it is boring!!! Wallace puts too much useless info into the 576 pages of this hunk of crap. The first sentance is about two pages long and he often switches between 3rd and 2nd person, it is really annoying. Dont wate your life reading this book try reading "My name is asher LEv" by Chaim Potok It is truly an inspiring novel unlike this boring book. Wow i hate this book i truly hate it with every square inch of my body! I promise dont waste ur time reading this boo 
 I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it.  My kids can use it to gain some insight.  It is very easy reading, too 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 i love RL, but this is blasphemy. if you want beats, go buy a friggin 50 cent rekkid. blues music, esp RL, is all about pure raw emotion. this rekkid is the output of a computer program, and thats exactly what it sounds like....every beat exactly on time,  precise, sterile.....i hate this rekkid, its really awful. shame on fat possum....they used to be about documenting a pure, dying art form. now fat possum is all about "updating" the blues to "increase the audience"...fat possum only cares about the $$. 
 First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:  (1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.  Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond.  I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.  (2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.  (3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk".  I consider it item a waste of money 
 Readers are led to assume that this book will deliver more information than it does 
 Bernard Lewis is a historian of the Ottoman era.  Period.  He sets himself up as an expert on Arabs and the modern Middle East, which is preposterous.  He does not know Arabic and certainly does not routinely converse with modern Arabs, in all of their many countries.  He uses terms like Unbelievers, which insults Westerners, when Muslims never do and never would -- that term is used by extremists whose mentality is much like that of our White Aryans.  And just about as representative.  In everything he writes, Lewis harps on the House of War and House of Peace, an idea one thousand years out of date.  That was Crusader-era thinking, which was outrageous and should embarrass both sides today. The problem is not religion, it is political policies, and long digressions into Crusader and post-Crusader history do not shed insight into beliefs and resentments today.  He uses broad terms like "Muslim rage" -- all Muslims?  Certainly not.  Consider his assertion that it is an intolerable humiliation for Muslims to be taught by Unbelievers -- does that make sense?  With the thousands of Muslims who are being, and have been, educated in the West?  Who hire Western advisors? "What went wrong?"  Western intrusion into the Middle East region, that's what.  Today most vividly illustrated by Israel and Iraq, and shoring up corrupt regimes like the Saudis (who are no friends of America and promote their exclusivist religion to our detriment).  But to admit political issues is to bring up the too-painful possibility of reviewing America's policies, so Lewis et al. harp on religion (are 5 million Muslims in America motivated to hurt anybody? They are in every city and town.  Do they hate America and or non-Muslims?  Try asking them, because Lewis certainly has not).   Lewis has done immeasurable damage to the image of Muslims and Middle Easterners, and fostered much hatred based on his reckless statements.  This is the EXPERT who advised the Bush White House and encouraged the neocon insanity to go about happily creating democracies in the Middle East which would then lead to love all around...  easy success in Iraq would be just the beginning of this miracle.  On this rests his credibility 
 I gave this a 2 star review not because I don't like the series but the way the disks were processed. DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets 
 I was eager to read this book, but after reading it I was left completely flat.  The rest of the iceberg?  Hardly.  Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page.  He admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.    This book is touted as: his full and complete story.  So we learned he was watching Ren & Stimpy during his NFL Draft.  Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read?  How about telling us more of the inside details...  How did Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  Who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  What was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at Ohio State?  When, and why did he begin using pot?  If football is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  What happened to plans for medical school?  We know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented.  I also felt Smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of America.  Who is attacking him?  Why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  He tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  The truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.    Leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'I did this, I did that, I went to bed, next day.'  Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  Smith notes "less than 50 percent of Americans read at a 10th-grade level".  Well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people.  One lesson from this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  This book is another one of those times.  He should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  Build the characters; help us feel their stories.  Instead, Smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  Sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book.  I'm sure Smith is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but I felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.    Instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg. 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 I'm sure this is a great tape for yoga enthusiasts, but it's way too hard for real beginners.  I do aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes a day, so I'm not a complete couch potato.  I thought I could use some strengthening and stretching exercises, so I bought this program.  The trouble is that there's no working up to the positions  -- it's all or nothing, and if you're not strong or flexible enough to hold the position, down you go.  I found it really, really hard.  I could manage less than half the positions.  Since each flows into the next, you don't get to stop and try less advanced versions.   I hate to think what the advanced programs are like!   I also have a small quarrel with the outside of the package, which says that the participants are of "all body types."   That would be both slim and strong, and very slim and strong.  There are no pudgy real beginners on this tape.  For instance, if you're a woman who can't already do a number of full-body push-ups (no touching your knees to the floor!), you won't get through this tape. I think this would be a good program for people who've already done considerable yoga or strength training.  But it's not for beginners 
 I really thought I would be able to learn about the Philadelphia Project from this book, considering the title. However, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. The entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place.  This book was disappoiting to an extreme. 
 Human slavery was embraced and endorsed both by the Koran and the Hadith.  Islamic slavery begain with Mohammed and continued until the 1900"sfor 200 years after slavery had been abolished in the west.  Saudi Arabia did not abolish slavery until 1964, Kuwait did not abolish slavery until 1968.  Slavery is Islamic as daily prayers.  Robert Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes and sold into slavery in the Ummayad, Abassid and Ottoman empires.  The general practice was to castrate the males and press them into military service.  No Muslim can object to slavery as it was fully endorsed by Mohammed and it become the military modus operandi of the successors to Mohammed who successfully used slavery soldier in their campaigs of conquest 
 Sandra Boynton writes songs like someone who has never heard a song before.  The pictures are adorable, sure.  But here's the thing--I don't just want adorable pictures.  Are there a lot of toddler books that *aren't* cute?  If you're going to write a book about the way you feel about your kid and put it in the form of a song, by God that song had better be cute as well.  I challenge anyone to sing the song in this book *AS WRITTEN, without changing the words.  It can't be done unless you're some kind of beat poet or Yoko Ono or something 
 It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.  Do not buy this camera.   It did take decent movies, and the size is nice 
 This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as "an offshoot of Islam", and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes 
 Arthur Rowe is a graying middle-aged man who visits a parish carnival. He tries the fortune teller and unknowingly mentions a coded question. He is told to guess the weight of the cake raffle as "four pounds eight and a half ounces"! Rowe won this prize, but there was some question about it. Back at his apartment he has a piece of cake. Then a bomb falls and destroys his apartment (war time London). The new tenant went to the hospital. Rowe goes to a Private Inquirer to find out about this new tenant, and why he put a drug in Rowe's tea. Next Rowe goes to track down the fortune teller, and visits the lobbying group called the "Free Mothers". Hilfe takes him to a seance where somebody is stabbed. Rowe makes his escape before the police arrive. [This is followed by pages of reminiscing about Rowe's boyhood. It pads the story, and displays Greene's literary prowess. A film would cut it all out to simplify the story.] Pages tell of life in wartime London under the bombs.  The story continues with an undercover operative fooling Rowe into taking a suitcase to a hotel room. ["No good deed ever goes unpunished."] Johns explains the "Ministry of Fear" as the method of gathering dirt on important people then threatening them with exposure if they don't cooperate. [SOP for the Secret Services.] Could a witness disappear into a private asylum (Book Two)? Rowe manages to escape from the asylum, and goes to the police. His information matches what is known. The police raid the private asylum and find 3 dead men. They cannot find the spool of microfilm with the secret papers. They find the buttons and shoes from Jones, the private inquirer, but nothing else. Its easy to get rid of a body in war time. It all ends well: the secret microfilm is recovered, and Arthur is happy.  What could Green have been thinking? The drama about a secret spy ring is masked by the psychological musings of Arthur. The much better "The Third Man" is an improved version of this story, all the dull parts were omitted. Was this written for domestic propaganda? Greene worked for British Intelligence during the war, he could have written a better story. 
 "It is now widely assumed that religion played a minimal role in forming America's Founding ideals.  America's Founders, it is said, consciously rejected religious principles and borrowed their best ideas about law and politics from the ancient Greeks and Romans in addition to Renaissance and Enlightenment philosophers.  This view is common throughout most history textbooks today.  Although Greek, Roman, Renaissance, and Enlightenment sources were important, their influence has been overemphasized, while the influence of religion has been seriously understated."  This paragraph from the Foreword of Never Before in History sounds like a reasonable thesis and one for which I have great sympathy.  Unfortunately, this book never quite lives up to its thesis due to a combination of poor scholarship and sloppy reasoning.  For example: -John Calvin was never the mayor of Geneva, as the book asserts (p. 46) - he wasn't even a citizen of Geneva until shortly before his death.  -Slavery in the south could not have troubled the northern Puritans, as is asserted on p. 119, as letters are available in which the northern Puritans discussed which races made the best slaves.  -The authors, throughout the first part of the book, champion "consent of the governed" when discussing the colonies' break with England.  But when they reach the writing of the US Constitution, however, they claim that it was a "permanent bond that could only be broken by death."    -In order to prove the Puritan influence on the Founders, the authors try to tie the major characters of the Revolutionary era to the Puritans through various tenuous connections, e.g. Samuel Adams was a Puritan because he went to Harvard, which was founded by Puritans.  This last point is, I think, the most egregious error of this book.  It flattens over a century of colonial history into a one-dimensional picture, so that the authors can equate any one who believes in God in the 18th century with the Puritans of the 17th century.  Surely the Congregationalists, Unitarians, and Deists of the 18th century had little in common with their Puritan forbears of the 16th century.  Attending a college founded by Puritans over 100 years earlier hardly made one a Puritan.  If you are interested in the thesis that this book begins with, a far better source is A Theological Interpretation of American History by C. Gregg Singer.  Like Amos and Gardiner, Singer believes that we can identify Christian influences in the founding of our nation, but we must look beyond the founders to the Puritans.  Writing over 20 years before NBIH, Singer, accurately describes the problems apparent in the later book:  "That the Jeffersonian democracy was founded on Christian principles and simply reflects the social implications of the Gospels is one of the most deadly, and at the same time one of the most persistent errors of contemporary America.  The reference to God in the Declaration of Independence, and the apparent submission to his will, should not blind us to the tragic misuse of biblical ideas to convey Deistic principles for the realization of a society which would be essentially humanistic and anti-supernaturalistic in character." 	"Many sincere evangelicals are unwilling to accept this fact, apparently in the fear that in so doing they are conceding too much ground to those who, in our own day, wish to carry this process of secularization to even further excesses than occurred in the early days of the Republic.  Their motives are most worthy, but the ground they have chosen on which to defend the evangelical cause, and the cause of a truly biblical conception of the American state, is faulty.  They must choose higher ground and that higher ground is the Puritan conception of our destiny, the Puritan Dream for America.  Puritanism did not lack for defenders and while their voices were stilled to a great degree during the excitement and full bloom of the Revolution, they would still be heard, and that Puritan heritage would rise again to give health and vigor to the new nation under the Constitution, for in the Convention of 1787, it would gain a hearing that it had been denied in that earlier assembly.  An evangelical strategy which overlooks the clear testimony of history in regard to the nature and purposes of Jeffersonian democracy in the interests of preserving the essential elements of a Christian patriotism is doing a great disservice both to the Gospel and to the very patriotism it is seeking to preserve."  (pp. 41-42)  Singer explains the difference:   "The Puritans held to a very different conception of liberty from that which is so prevalent in contemporary thought and governmental theory.  For the Puritan, liberty was in no way associated with the doctrine of natural law and natural rights, but found its origin and meaning in that covenant which God had made with his people.  Liberty was not a natural right, but a God-given right and privilege to be zealously guarded from despots, to be sure, but also subject to precise Biblically-defined limits." (p. 17)  "The whole conception of government that would later be proclaimed by John Locke and others, which placed the sovereignty in the hands of the people and which found the origin of government in a human compact was utterly unknown to the Puritans."  (p. 18)  These two very different ideas are simply flattened into one by Amos and Gardiner and labeled "Christian."  Although history does need to be somewhat "simplified" for children, it should certainly not be simplified beyond usefulness.  This is what I think Amos and Gardiner have done, to the detriment of our students.  
 I've sat through more than my fair share of pretentious films in my attempt to escape Hollywood's drivel.  Based on the cast and the strength of the film maker, I thought Holy Smoke would have a good script, strong performances and something to say.  Indeed, the film began with much promise, only to bogged down by what I would call an awful second and dreadful third act.  How the characters get from point A to point F is beyond me and certainly not motivated by what was shown on the screen.  If this movie was designed to question the roles of men and women in religious circles, question physical vs. mental domination in relationships, or question choices vs. others' perceptions of those choices, it would have been a worthwhile use of kodak film.  In the end, the film suffers from too many ideas, too little cohesion and too much self-importance.  I would suggest avoiding this film, almost as much as I would avoid Gigli.  
 A graduate program had the audacity to use this as a text.  I would say this is a solid community college level text, or perhaps an intro to communications text for a 4 year course.  Most definitely not a graduate course level text.  Don't expect to gain any particularly new insight into communication if your grad school assigns this text, although you could probably expect an easy A 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)

 Sullivan was one of the best around.  But somehow he has become just another doom and gloom pundit.  He even manages to equate the Christian right with the Islamo terrorists. It is a shame to see such a talented guy become an extremist too.  His optimism has been replaced by cynicism and hate.  He used to make arguments and discuss both sides and how he ridicules others and calls them names.  
 My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action.  
 This book offers no real practical advice for reader to "survive" in crazy and dysfunctional workplace. Furthermore, the writing of this book is way too PHD-alike to tie to its "light-hearted" title. I stopped reading it after 20 pages or less 
 "The service from this vendor is horrible. My account was charged in May of this year and as of 6/26/06 have not received anything. First they said they need to make a model change. I was fine with the model change but never got the product. I sent many...notes to Nicholas Nasti but he has been unable to fix the problem. Recently I have been unable to contact them with notes or telephone. 
 This was the second book that I have read of the authors (after the readable Body Double) and I would strongly recommend that readers unfamiliar with Gerritsen (a talented writer) avoid this book and look at the later books.  This novel centres around the events in a small Maine town where the local kids have started random acts of violence. The town doctor notices the acts and works out the correlation between the violence and the strange happenings at the local lake.   I found that this was a poor mans Michael Crichton, made worse with the authors leaning towards adding the romance element into the book. It may be just me, but the book seemed written more like a movie script than a novel.  A readable book if you can suspend disbelief 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 This pamphlet was not what I expected.  The paper quality is good, and the pamphlet would be good to carry along to identify plants.  However, I expected it to tell me when plants would be blooming and in what type of environment they would be found.  This fold-out pamphlet has excellent pictures and name identification, but not the information I expected when I purchased it 
 Here are Barrett's major points, (with my comments):1/the USDA Food Guide Pyramid is all you need. (Really, then why has the pyramid been changed so many times? Have our needs as a species changed?) 2/ Following the US Dietary Guidelines will prevent all deficiencies.(By it's -own- standards, yes. Should one organization decide both the requirements -and- judge the results? The only thing that could possibly make them wrong would be for them to admit it. Not likely. It's a self-monitoring agency..not a good thing. 3/All vitamin companies are liars. (Some are, some aren't, just like any group. You're a psychiatrist, how honest did  Freud  turn out to be?) 4/Stress causes the symptoms that are attributed to poor diet. (A psychiatrist would think that, of course. Aside from that, says who?  A 25-year-long suppressed government paper states that nutritional deficencies are the #1 cause of health problems. ) 5/Milled out B vitamins are put back with enrichment.(Sounds like adding VITAMINS to me, I thought you were against that. And how do you replace nutrients that science hasn't discovered yet?) 6/Only a few vitamins are sensitive to heat.(Only a few? I guess too few to matter?)7/Minerals are not destroyed by cooking. (Correct, but they are -altered-, and that can't be a good thing, assuming they were in the correct form in the first place.) 8/Additives aren't proven to cause problems.(Very close to proven, Doc. I don't want to die to prove it. The agencies in charge of safety don't have the time,resources, inclination, or even the legal right to check -every- ingredient thoroughly, and the synergy of combined ingredients isn't even something they -attempt- to test. The -government- must prove an ingredient is -unsafe-; it's -not- the duty of the manufacturer to prove that it -is- safe. Is -that- really safe?) 9/Fluoride is good. (There is so much detailed evidence against fluoride that I accuse any proponent of collusion with the industry.) 10/Small doses of pesticides are no problem. (How small, and who's measuring? Even if this is possibly true for the few poisons that break down quickly, it is absolutely untrue for poisons that remain intact and accumulate over one's lifetime; small now is big later.  This has been  proven to be an especially -deadly- lie when synergy of poisons sometimes increase their toxicity a -thousand- times over). There's plenty more,  of course. I believe Barrett knows where his bread is buttered. Corporate criminals need confederates in medicine to make the machine work...Doesn't psychiatry have a bad enough reputation already? This book would be  joke if it weren't so dangerous./// For a truer look at the modern world's effect on our health, read _The Hundred Year Lie_, by Randall Fitzgerald. The author is not an advocate of the  typical health food products, (which are often  just as filled with unlabeled additives as the 'foods' Barrett defends), but convincingly, debunks  Barrett's claims for the safety of government approved additives to , and manipulations of our food supply.///    
 Such a sad sequel to the best video game movie. Mortal Kombat: Anilhilation was anihilated the day it was made. The story was poorly done. I didn't like how the characters act in this film. Jax {Williams} acts like a afician-american stereotype. Sonya {Hess} acts like a weak little bitch. Sindel {Vander} acts like one of those pathetic villianess you see in those direct-to-video films that have dumb villianess. And Brian Thompson should be a shame of himself, such a good character actor playing a pethetic Shao Khan.  One thing that sucks in this film is that Radien {Remar} and Shao Kahn are brothers and Shinnok {Schore} is their father. What a pathetic change to add in this film. Raiden and Kahn are far from family and Shinnok and Kahn don't even like each other...and they're not father and son in the game.  This film cost $30 million, yet the special effects in this film look so cartoony. In fact, I've seen Playstation One graphics look better than that.   This film is really bland, and John R. Leonetti directing style sucks.  If you wanna watch a sequel to Mortal Kombat, just watch yourself playing Mortal Kombat 2 on Midway's Arcade Greatest Hits 2 on Playstation 2 and XBOX 
 This had a lot of basic information on ADD, but it wasnt very interesting. It didn't offer a lot of practical help either. Most of what was in it I already knew. I don't recommend this book. 
 This is as bad as Out Cold. I think most viewers, even if they just want dumb fun, will find this movie insulting to their intelligence. I guess maybe it's just a movie to watch while drinking with friends. Your brain would have to be completely turned off to be entertained by it. It's template derived, an endless string of cliches. The kind of script that draws inspiration from other movies rather than from real life or a creative imagination. The basic plot outline of a guy making an emergency trip across the country to save his relationship, while falling for another girl in the process, is ripped off of Road Trip who ripped it off of Overnight Delivery. Only in this movie instead of the other girl being wilder and broadening the guy's horizons she's more conservative, I guess a testament to the conservative mentality behind this film. The added bit of having to save the girlfriend from a sleazy record executive type = Wayne's World. The picking up girls who subject the unwitting guy to violent bondage = Tomcats. The popsickle scene was the only remotely clever part. If it was just the girl licking the popsickle seductively to tease the boy it would be really dumb, but because the guy was doing it too it had a certain inane random charm to it that I liked.  It's pretty tragic to think that hundreds of people spent months working on this. The only real problem is the script. It's a professional looking movie as far as the actors and cameras go, but it's all wasted effort because of the weak script. It's like building a mansion on a sinkhole. 
 Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone.  I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting.  I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul.  I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though.  Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense.  It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive 
 Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  Do not bother with it.  This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530 
 Well the book itself is more or less readable. The "mom intervening from above" idea is sort of interesting but doesn't quite work out. Just like the one-too-many coincidences in the story. Actually the story is the maine thing in this book that literally DISTURBS me.  I, just like some other of the reviewers picked this book up because i thought that it might be a relaxing light read. Boy, was i wrong.. I don't think i have ever been this angry at the contents of a book, even while reading Hitler's "Mein Kampf. There is so much unfairness in the whole story. Most of the reviewers think that the main problem of the novel is Shelby and her attitude but i thoroughly disagree. So alright, she is selfish and conceited but she is a smart and accomplished woman! And why is the fact that she chose not to have children considered a sin against mankind and the ultimate act of selfishness?! What ever happened to democracy and the concept of a thing called choice? Nobody seems to take into consideration that her childhood was a mess, she lost her mother when she was ten, her father banished all material evidence of her ever existing and forbade the girl to mourn. Not to mention the fact that he was sleeping with his dying wife's sister while she lay in hospital. And almost immediately after her leaving this world, he goes off and merries his daughters' aunt who (by total coincidence, of course) is pregnant from him! Shelby has every right to be angry with him! But in the book, everything that the other characters do and say is directed against her, no one even contemplates the idea that maybe she has a good reason for her attitude. Which i think she does.  And the character of her sister Lauren. She is even more egoistical than Shelby herself, not to mention that she is about as mentally stable as Jell-O. Of course, the fact that she can't have children makes her extremely unfortunate but she has absolutely no right whatsoever to ask her sister to be a surrogate mother! Well, alright, she does have a right to ask, but not a right to MAKE her do it! Shelby was against the idea right from the start and Lauren should have accepted that! But no! The little brat of a sister brings on the mental black-mail! And when Shelby still refuses to carry a child for Lauren, once again, everyone starts treating her like the witch of the century! Sisterly love or no sisterly love a woman has a right to chose not to have children! Besides, Lauren pruposed not to use her own eggs but Shelby's which means that, basically, Shelby would just have to give away her own child. To make the picture chrystal clear- Shelby has to get pregnant from Lauren's sexually harassing stallion of a husband whom she can't stand, ignore her own life for about a year and then give Lauren her FIRSTBORN! First of all, that is too much to as of a woman and second of all it is beyond unfair not to aknowledge her right to refuse.  I haven't yet finished reading the book but i just can't wait till i do. it will be a nice change to read something that is not utterly against human rights 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 this is entertainment? Wow, exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat 
 This is the kind of film I typically enjoy, even if others consider it average at best.  Oddly enough, though, the tables have been turned when it comes to Lady in the Water.  Frankly, I just didn't find this to be a very good film.  The story had potential, certainly, but M. Night Shyamalan's script, which involved way too many people coming together and accepting a most extraordinary story far too easily, is decidedly weak and flimsy.  And while I certainly understand that the events that play out convey many a metaphorical meaning, too much of what I saw seemed to be made up as things went along.  And for something that supposedly originated with a bedtime story for Shyamalan's kids, it's so bloated with characters and plays so fast and loose with the few rules most fairy tales actually follow that it loses its appeal pretty quickly.  So, basically, what you have here is a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) named Story showing up in the dirty swimming pool of a seedy motel housing a really diverse range of tenants, from a grumpy, generally silent old man to Chinese immigrants to a film critic to a bodybuilder who only works out on one side of his body, etc.  Story is discovered by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building superintendent, a good-natured soul and just about the only sympathetic character anywhere in the vicinity of this film.  He takes Story in and slowly learns her story: she's a Narf who has left the Great Ocean temporarily on an important mission to change man's destiny, and she has to avoid some nasty Scrunts who want to stop her and prevent the Great Eatlon from carrying her back home - and, by the way, there's another creature called the Tartutic who scares the heck out of Scrunts.  And what is this grand mission?  She has to communicate a silent message to a young writer, played by none other than Shyamalan himself, whose book will basically save the world some day.  It's not hard to see why some critics point to Shyamalan's ego having run totally amuck, especially given the fact he included in the story an unlikable film critic mouthing only clichés for no plot-related reason (but obviously for personal - not to mention childish - reasons).  One must remember that Shyamalan threw a hissy fit and took his fairy tale elsewhere when the perceptive folks at Disney pointed out that the story needed some serious revising.  In the end, I'm afraid I have to agree with those who see Lady in the Water as a misguided product of Shyamalan's ego and filmmaking arrogance.  Talk about metaphors all you like, but the film's plot is basically nonsense.  At one point, Story - who can see the future - refuses to help all of her new friends by telling them who is supposed to represent whom, but she does agree to do the Yes-No thing when they ask her questions.  That's the kind of thing you expect to see in a sit-com long after it has already jumped the shark.  And I still can't figure out why everyone in the motel bought into Story's story so easily.  Paul Giamatti turns in a brilliant performance, but that's about the only thing Lady in the Water has going for it 
 I got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac's death. I think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills. The cd also lacks production! The beats are terrible. The outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste! 
 At times it doesn't work right. You have to play with the buttons, it acts like the battery is dead, but I tried 3 different new batteries 
 In response to the overwhelming academic reaction to his first essay "The American Civil Religion," Robert Bellah again addresses the creation, development, and subsequent destruction of "the covenant" manifested in the American Civil Religion in his book, The Broken Covenant.  By enumerating and expounding upon the "myths" of the American Civil Religion, Bellah attempts to uncover the American self-understanding that has both created and corrupted the Covenant. The myth of origin reveals the basic self-conceptualization of America: a pristine wilderness, a place of new beginnings for "the chosen" who reform the old covenant.  According to Bellah, from a biblical as well as classical republican perspective, America is a land of living myth with a covenant based on Calvinist teachings of common charity, love, individual dignity, and responsibility through which the internal spiritual covenant meshes with the external political covenant to create public virtue. He believes that the American "covenant" legitimizes and gives purpose to the American identity. He compares his book to the lamentations of a prophet crying out in the wilderness, trying to alert the population to societal corruption and impending doom while maintaining a hope for the future upon repentance. He argues that utilitarianism, capitalism and science, along with the "sins" of slavery and the treatment of the Native Americans, have corrupted and destroyed this covenant, leaving America empty of purpose. In violation of the covenant, capitalistic self-interest motivated American society instead of republican virtue.  His solution espouses the creation of a new covenant that humbly recognizes the past and present flaws of America, renews the traditions of the old covenant and provides moral and spiritual meaning for the technological and scientific dimensions of modern society.   Using mostly primary sources, armed with a sociologist's understanding of American history and fueled by personal experience, Bellah attempts to evaluate the American Civil Religion in the past, present, and future.  Though he realizes the current problem regarding the corrupted ideals of republicanism, equality, spirituality and religion, his ideas for the resurgence of the American Civil Religion are vague and abstract. He proposes a state of constant revolution, a continuous renewal of covenant through religious and spiritual rebirth that will fill the external political covenant of America with meaning.  Along with the restitution of the inward covenant, Robert Bellah kowtows to the popular theories of the early 1970s, such as communitarianism and socialist policies, which have failed thus far in America.   Rather than a transcendent new order, he espouses the call for reform common to the generation disillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal; his book appears to be the result of a personal attempt to find meaning in a changing modern society.  
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 I tried it also as a less expensive alternative, and won't be ordering again.  The flavor just tasted "off" to me.... kinda like old coffee that's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours.. didn't have that "freshly brewed taste" 
 I've read probably more than my share of presidential biographies and this book is probably the worst (as in "unprofessionally written") bio I have ever come across. Period. It's not the subject. It's Mr. Widmer's flippant, "terminally hip", straight-out-of-People-Magaine, style of writing.   What do I mean? Well, the first thing that struck me was that though the book is not very long -- which given the fairly obscure subject matter is understandable -- the rambling intro to this work IS long. We're talking someting like twenty+ pages!  I kept reading page after page after page of the intro and found myself wondering "Ok. So where's the actually book??" I mean, was the author getting paid by the word or something?  And the work itself...again, "flippant" is the work that pretty much sums it up. Ex-president Bill Clinton was mentioned more than once, as well as BC and his intern Monica L. were also mention (in a book about Martin Van Buren?), The sainted (to Mr. Widmer) FDR is also mentioned several times, likewise Hollywood's Steven Spielburg and TV-producer Aaron Spelling... yeah, I know. In about about Martin Van Buren?? But then, I just said these folks were mentioned in Mr. Widmer's book. I didn't say that had any thing to DO with the subject of the book.   In addition, there were terrible gaps/unresolved events in VB life that the writer skipped over. For example: The young VB, an up and coming legal eagle, goes to NYC and there hones his legal skills + moves in very lofty circles + became close friends of titans like Aaron Burr, etc., and then, we are told, that after 6 years of this that VB up and left NYC to become a law partner with this step-brother in some little town in upstate NY. The end. Huh??  A young, rising attorney moving strickly "Class A" social circles in NYC, suddenly drops everything and buries himself in the country? And there's no explaination by the writer. Probably b/c he doesn't know either.  Another example, VB's wife suddenly dies (She just dies. No accident, no illness, her time just ran out) and he is left widower with three young sons. What arrangements does he make for those children, esp. as he is now a mover-and-shaker in DC by now. Again, we'll never know. The three boys simply ***PPIFF*** off the radar and we (the readers) don't learn of them again until they are young men. Granted, it's not vital but it is a loose end, and it would go a long way in fleshing out the personal side of VB. Again, maybe the writer himself didn't know.  And so it goes....  The book is littered with things like this: dead ends, loose ends, and washed out bridges. This book isn't writing. It's pop journalism. Strickly "People" magazine school of journalism. I gave it one star b/c, heck, if you can pick it up for a quarter at a yard sale go ahead and get it, read it. Otherwise, save your money 
 This author is obviously very well versed in alot of material as you know from everything he has written.  He remarks that he will only use from acupuncture what is real and forget the hocus/pocus.  I feel that Mr Chaitow highly underestimates the powers of acupuncture medicine. I am a western trained physician who has just trained in this ancient wonderful world of acupunture. There is no methodical or conceptual description for point selection, but a mere lists of points for pain in areas of the body. For headaches-points A,B & C. For backpain--points X,Y & Z, etc.  I have no regrets in the purchase, but I like it only to supplement my other material 
 I bought the original Tom Tom Go back in November 2004.  Since then, my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure.  My last attempt, 10 days ago, was an effort to buy updated maps for my product.  Yes, their website will offer to sell you maps, but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own, and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing, in some cases for a large sum of money.  If you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call, you will be disappointed.  I am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported 
 Unintentionally hilarious; so pretentious and poorly made that I was strangling with laughter several times. Jesus/God/Satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways. The maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup, cures scarred children, and floats in the air. The wife bites the side of her finger, has sex with random strangers, and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as Mozart's Requiem thunders in the background.  The movie is technically inept and badly written. Any randomly chosen film of Bunuel or Almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this Pasolini fiasco. Recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious.  Two stars for the "So bad it's good" factor. 
 Reading this book was like watching a made-for-TV movie; it was somewhat entertaining, somewhat predictable, somewhat preposterous and completely forgetable.  I read this during a beach vacation and it definitely kept me interested, but always in the back of my mind was this voice telling me how ridiculous the book was.  Read it if you have nothing better to read 
 If you watched the movie and remember a few great songs, this is not where you will find them.  "California Dreaming" by The Mamas and the Papas? Nope, not here. "Things In Life" by Dennis Brown (the jukebox song from the bar)? Nope, not here. "What a Difference a Day Makes" by Dinah Washington? You guessed it, not here. But the big kicker that you're going to love the most- that beautiful mezmerizing strings symphony from the opening scenes is here, well sort of- OK, not at all. Actually Fornication in Space is not the song we're talking about- in fact this song was never in the movie at all! Its a cheezy synthesizer *cover* of the symphonic strings piece. You're actually looking for Michael Galasso's "Baroque", and yep, you guessed it, its not here. What a farse. When you consider this Hong Kong import "soundtrack" if you actually want to call it that- consider other HK imports like bronze Rolex watches and you'll get the idea.. 
 I have trusted Frommer's travel guides for years, but this one was a complete disappointment.  The author recommended hotels that turned out to be really seedy.  I wondered if he had actually visited some of the places he mentioned.  The book itself was confusing in its organization, and the only useful parts were the pull-out map and the suggested itineraries 
 "The Best of the Ronettes" CD is the worst-sounding CD I've ever heard.  On most of the songs, the voices of the girls are not as loud as the musical instruments.  I didn't have any of the Ronettes' records when their songs were on the charts, but I did hear their songs on the radio and they sounded much better than they do on this CD.  Since the songs are all mono on the CD, messing with the graphics equalizer doesn't help at all.  You can't get the voices to come in at a natural-sounding mix with the instrumentation.  On many songs, there's so much distortion that you can't really hear the tunes.  However, the two big hits ("Be My Baby" and "Baby, I Love You") do sound better than the rest of the songs.  If you just want those two songs, you'll be satisfied.  Of course, Phil Spector was famous for his "wall of sound" when he was producing the Ronettes, the Crystals, etc., but on this CD the "wall" crushes the voices 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 I have never read this author before and probably won't again. I found the story hard to follow from the beginning and if you are an animal lover you probably will be as repulsed as I was in the sequence about "skinning the cat down to his whiskers and watching him stagger around."  This book is going in the trash literally and I didn't care to read any further than the cat episode which was quite early on 
 Almost each page of this book has ads on the author's website. The content of the book very basic and can be found in any other book for beginners or any trading website 
 This book's premise is fundamentally flawed. The authors try to promote the use of shark cartilage to cure cancer, but they use bad science. In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get  cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous  for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need  traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for  their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money 
 I used this book in my sophomore year Intro to EE class and it has to be the most horribly written technical textbook ever. I read from the book only once the whole semester and spent the rest of the time learning from tutors and lecture notes. The examples are cryptic and poorly explained and the chapters are haphazardly organized. I pity those who're forced to buy this for their EE classes, but if you have a choice, you can definitely find yourself a much better textbook than this piece of junk 
 Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.  Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.  Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.  For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.  I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda. 
 I haven't tried the recipes because the print is very hard to read.  It is a light green print and if one has bad eyes you will need lots of light.  Very disappointed in the book because of the print 
 From the very beginning, it is clear that the house project is a project doomed to difficulty--the builders were breaking ground without having a clear design, a price point, and a contract.    What I took away from this book was the absolute necessity of having *EVERYTHING* in writing.  If Bill (the architect) had provided completed drawings early in the process, the estimating would have been more accurate, there would have been fewer confrontations, and some of the change orders could have happened before the building started, meaning when it's still cheap and easy to make changes.  Of course, that would have taken away from the drama of the story.  Any project manager would have cringed all the way through this book--it was bound to be a train wreck from the very beginning 
 I AM EXTREMLY UPSET.... I ORDERED THIS ITEM BACK IN JANUARY & NEVER RECEIVED IT!  WHY WAS IT ON BACK ORDER FOR SOOOOO LONG, AND WAS I EVER CHARGED FOR IT????? 
 First off I'd like to tell you that this is only the second Star Wars book I've ever read, 'Jedi Search' being the first. I actually liked the first book, it drew upon the Star Wars lore well and was a decent read. However, this book made me groan in so many places that I felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it (BE WARNED, THIS MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS). Thusly:  How much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions? It reminds me of a 'Little Britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the Bible out to make up the space! I don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point!  For some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to 'ground' the story by CONSTANTLY relating to the Star Wars films. For example, when Wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there, he says something along the lines of: I was actually in the cantina in Mos Eisley when Luke met Han and Chewbacca, little did I know the brush I had with history there.... GAHHHHHHH!!! WHY!? HOW DID HE KNOW!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk*  He does this throughout the two books I've read so far!! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films?  Then there's Admiral Daala. Made an Admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's reviewing recordings of speeches given by Tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing! It's only the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer! She should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the rebellion win)  He then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea, that of having a Jedi Academy (the point of the trilogy!). There's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the Jedi, but no - he has the Jedi go two-by-two into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make this SO much better!  I was incensed to find that Luke was actually made 'boring' in this book. Part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how Luke had grown. It all started very promisingly in the first book, having learnt that Luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever! (cool! I thought). It got to the stage where I'd dread coming back to the Jedi parts of the story because he was so dull.  The other trainee Jedi needed serious character development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene with Luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn't good enough.  As other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue, somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and Luke just meditates about it!? *grr*  Okay all that being said it was 'okay' and on the strength of the first book I will be reading the next book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to look!). 
 Conscious Acts of Creation: The Emergence of a new Physics by William A. Tiller, Walter E. Dibble, and Michael J. Kohane.  Publisher: Quality Books Inc. pages - 418  I like and don't like this book. It's billed as a book written for physics, but also applicable to people into metaphysics. But the problem is that the writing for this book is not intended for a general audience. It's intended for an audience that has a developed awareness of the highly technical language of physics and math. As such many people into metaphysics will have a hard time reading this book. I did. I had to read and reread many sections to try and understand the language being used.  A big part of the problem is that the organtization of this book's chapters is highly erratic. The authors jump around a lot. I actually understood a few of the final chapters, but only because the language was more general. I think it would have served the authors better to have put those chapters in the beginning of the text. Also none of the terms and acronyms were well defined or spelled out. A glossary would've done wonders for this book.  In defense of the book the ideas being worked with are intriguing and the authors did perk my interest and keep me reading...the problem is that while this book could interest a large audience of people, it can only have a big impact on a much smaller audience because of the highly technical language, bizarre layout, and lack of cohesion. As such the potential good this book could do is marred by the inability of the authors to write in a more accessible manner.  I did manage to understand a fair amount of this book, but I can only chalk that up to reading up a lot on physics and science. I only hope that the authors' other books are more accessible.  Regrettably I have to give this book two stars out of five and recommend to the authors that they work with an editor who can help them with layout issues and with language (in terms of making the language more accessible to a wider audience) 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 Wow... well I must say that I really feel "taken"!!  Both Taunton Press and Keister have done excellent work in the past, so I did not think twice about purchasing the book... Unfortunately I did not pay attention to the SIZE!  I fully expected this to be a picture book because that was how it was advertised.  But I assumed it would be 8"x10" like similar Taunton publications.  Did it do what it set out to do? Yes.  It is a picture book about cottages.    I did not expect the book to be 5" x 6" -- less than half the size of normal books.  This is a "post card book".  Buyer Beware-- This book is tiny 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 Before I say anything, we all know "Kidz" Bop SUCKS- to put it in simple words. Here's why:  1. Behind These Hazel Eyes- This is a song about being "torn up"- probably from a breakup or an abusive relastionship. Do eight-year olds have any experience of this? Not likely, and the ones whose been abused have enough sense to skip *this* CD.  2. Beverly Hills- Its all about materilaisum, rich people, and stars. We don't need to fill kid's minds up with that anymore- espicially by horrible singers.  3. Don't Lie- This one isn't about lying that you like Mom's cooking or your sister's haircut. Those experiences go come by more often than cheating in a relationship.   4. Wake Me Up When September Ends- I have ALOT to say about this one. First, most younger kids don't experience their dad dying in a bloody war before knowing him- or understand what happens in death. The death they are more accustomed to is the family hamster or losing a life in Battleship. And the voice of this "singer"? To die for, acutally to die FROM. Such a thoughtful and meaningful shouldn't be sung like this.  5. Listen To Your Heart- They make a song about knowing to break up with someone special pretty bad. And its (in my opinion) and a bad song in the first place. The only thing appreciative about the real song is the smooth voice, of course thats gone.  There's sample of how I feel about Kidz Bop 9. I would do the other 13 songs but I'd rather not because: 1. I have a life (ahem) 2. I'd rather *not* burn my ears, thanks. So thanks for reading my review and I hope you agree with my opinion 
 Sometimes I like red neck humor.  I do.  I think it's down to earth humor and it makes me laugh.  Sometimes I really need one, ya know.  I did not get that from this movie.  Endless farting.  Endless.  Pissing too.  The story of a vile man hooking up with a girl who has nothing in common with him.  I did not make it to the end.  So bad.  So very very bad 
 Now that the author has a little fame, he has re-released this dog of a book.  It is very disjointed and one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read 
 I bought this book for $150 at the local bookstore - using brand new this semester. What do you get for that price? Cases that are not up to date (many end around 2000-2001), terrible topic headings within the chapters, cheap looking diagrams using company names that are blurry and ineffective, and another worthless book that isn't being bought back on your bookshelf.  And I haven't even started with the writing... They will give you a subject heading or topic that will be discussed without even explaining it very well AT ALL!  Many times a topic will be given, they give a mediocre company example and you don't understand the concept clearly.  My anger with the buyback policy and the ridiculousness of this class may be swaying my opinion, but I still say this book is toward the lower echelon of books I have had in the past.  
 When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies.  Now that twenty years have passed, all I can say is that it is so lame and corny that it's kind of embarrassing admitting that I used to like it so much.  Sure I still get a kick out of state-of-the-art (back then, at least) aircraft steaking all over the place, engaged in dogfights and all that... but that's about it.  The whole story is really half-baked, and not much good can be said about the acting.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, trust me, you haven't missing much and I'd recommend not wasting your time on it 
 i dont dislike the nonsinging, the music is very enjoyable but after a while it gets boring, very borin 
 I have read all of the leading books on men's clothing and style over the years. This ranks at the bottom of the list. It was boring and not well written.  I put it aside about a quarter of the way through. I am surprised by the other reviews. I felt like they must have been reading a different book! Save your money on this one. Buy any of Alan Flusser's books. They are all about great style and how to dress 
 I ordered this book with high hopes.  The reviews led me to believe it offered concrete suggestions for pressing problems.  It just isn't so.  This book seems to be primarily for people who want to rationalize the status quo: others suffer for reasons you can't influence, you are a good person for just talking about problems in the world while doing nothing about them, etc.  If you believe people who suffer get what they deserve or are simply a side-effect of the glorious free market then this book will be laughable to you.  If you believe making the world better for everyone is the primary obligation for members of "good society" then this book will be disappointing to you.  Etzioni mouths some standard platitudes, for example that we need universal health care, but inevitably either guts his statements by describing that he means something entirely different from what is understood by those statements or he backpedals furiously.  Sometimes he does both at once.  Here's a prime example, again regarding health care: "However, securing everyone a rich basic minimum of health care as a start should no longer be delayed if we seriously seek to move toward a good society".  What exactly is the oxymoronic "rich basic minimum" to which he refers?  We just don't know, and subsequent pages are no help.  As Etzioni reminds us often, this is something for further discussion (outside his book, of course) and dialogue.  From the merely comical "rich basic minimum", we move to the stunningly wrongheaded comment that "there is a profound tension between treating people as ends and as a source of profit".  There is nothing profound about this, nor is there tension except when the market is allowed to have its way with few controls.  Rather than taking the much more "people as ends" focused view that the market must serve society and must be constrained when it fails in that role, Etzioni asks us to believe that we shouldn't always treat other people as people - sometimes they really are commodities to be bought and sold for money.  Perhaps I am especially disappointed because I had such high hopes for this book.  I'm sticking with Amartya Sen and Wendell Berry because even if I don't always agree with them, I can always tell that they care deeply for others and want to offer suggestions for improving the world, not empty cliches 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 Well lets face it, Sir Paul McCartney is good at what he does, I mean he was part of the group that gave birth to what everybody now does, with of course, a few exceptions. Paul is a fine musician, songwriter, composer, and sound engineer. BUT; He is a lot older now and his voice is certainly not what it once was, although it is still better than most. It appears to me he is writing and recording this album (CD) Okay I'm old too! for posterity. He is already  in the history books with the Beatles acclaim, so why not put his mark on something of his own that will stand the test of time, and even cross over into several genre's. Will it satisfy Beatle fanatics? NO! Other than the fact that he WAS a Beatle and can't help but bring some of that sound to the table. BUT; this is Paul being Paul. If you like Paul and his taste of music you will love this. If you wane for more Beatle stuff you will be a little disappointed. BTW the Beatle stuff is done enjoy the legacy that was left and move on. 
 Alas, I've joined the group of dispointed consumers! I love Alton Brown, but this so called "book" is less (WAY less) than steller. I actually saw this at Chapters for $1.99 and couldn't bring myself to part with the Twoonie required to purchase it. All the previous reviews sun up my feelings - but I just had to add my two cents 
 Don't buy if you plan on printing often...runs out very very fast.  
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I bought this because the reviews for another, earlier version, the Korean import DVD, bemoaned that one's poor picture quality.  When this one became available, I hoped it was a legitimate and faithful DVD.  But this one looks terrible too.  I see I am not the only person still waiting for a clean restored print on DVD, one worthy of both the original and of today's technological capacity to render it in all its beauty and glory 
 Okay,i just got my UPS delivery. 1) these are half the size of a real donut. 2) dry,overpriced and just terrible 3) no flavor and horrible presentation 4) totally overpriced and not worth the money  I recently bought the low fat donuts recommended in the oct issue of "Every Day With Rachael Ray" Holey Donuts Ultra Low Fat Gourmet Donuts and these low fat donuts are full size,packed and shipped in a frozen cooler and oh my god they have REAL cinnamon buns that have 3 grams of fat,double the size and yes they cost more but everything arrives frozen ,thaws soft and moist and just blows this way 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again 
 The sixteenth book in the "Left Behind" series covers the one thousand years after the Glorious Appearing.  Jesus reigns from the holy temple in Jerusalem, David is his prince, and peace prevails throughout the world.  All adults in the world are either "naturals" (believers who were alive at the time of Jesus' coming), or "glorifieds" (those who returned to earth from Heaven), and will live out the Millennium and then proceed to heaven.  Children (those under the age of 100) must make the choice to be followers of Christ, or die on their 100th birthday.  The  members of the Tribulation Force have a children's day care ministry which serves hundreds of children and aims to bring the youth to Christ.  But there are pockets of dissent, even in this paradise.  A growing number of hedonistic "children" are members of The Other Light, a group that rejects Christ and longs for the return of Satan.  I found this book poorly written and disappointing.  The narrative is awkward, the dialogue is stilted, the characters are stereotypes, and the plot suffered without a villain. The authors admit there is scant scriptural information about the Millennium, so their detailed description of events come across as fantasy not grounded in prophesy.  The first hundred years is described in excruciating detail, and then in one sentence, 900 years passes and it's time for everyone on earth to either ascend to heaven or descend to the lake of fire with Satan. The earlier "Glorious Appearing" was a good book that wrapped up the series for me; this book was shallow, dull, and pointless. 
 I purchased this book to help me with ideas for homeschooling my children. This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except "turn off the television" and "read to your children". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant 
 I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE 
 If you believe that all men are out to get you, if you believe that all men are potential rapists, or if you believe that sex is a weapon men use to opress women, then this is the book for you! I imagine you will read the book while looking tentatively over your shoulder, fearing some evil man may pass by.  I always weigh every book I read objectively, trying to find a balance and see both sides of the argument. However, Andrea Dworkin makes this an impossible task for any sensible and rational person.  Even a cursory inspection of this book will make it a glaring certainty that the themes here are paranoia, hate, and fear. If you believe the psychotic rantings of Andrea Dworkin, all men hate all women (this isn't a negotiable idea), and sex couldn't possibly be an act that a woman might consensually enjoy with a man. No, if you believe the ravings of this madwoman, all men are rapists that use sex to "keep women in their place". No woman ever "really" wants to have sex with a man. But, alas, women are forced to have sex with men. And if a man ever sees a woman experiencing happiness, he immediately devises a way to rob her of it. Give me a break.  If you enjoy or agree with these kind of theories, don't have a penis, or are lacking common sense, then you will love this book.  It's funny how Andrea Dworkin preaches (high and blind in her lunatic ivory tower) about the need for a woman to control her own life, yet goes on to tell women that they cannot be happy with a man or enjoy sex with one, which takes away the exact choice she rages about. One thing she professes, in no uncertain terms, is that if you're a woman that does not agree with her, then you are a detriment to all woman. In the real world, we call people like her dictators.  Even more irritating than her inane diatribes, is her complete and total lack of credible evidence or argument. There are no facts, only paranoid opinions. Andrea Dworkin truly believes that the whole of the male species is out to get her.  What's really disheartening about all this is that there are so many women fighting for true equality (and not the complete subjugation men). Unfortunately, paranoia is contagious, and a few other women have turned to this sort of radical feminism. Studies have shown, time and again, that the vast majority of these radical feminists have been either raped or molested at some point in their lives. So it's safe to say that these women are extremely biased, provide no evidence of any kind, and make up blatant lies to support their "cause". And yet they purport to speak for all women. It's clear that these women, just like Andrea Dworkin, are the real detriment to women everywhere.  But I'm not worried. Most women, like myself, still love men, and will continue to ignore the ravings of the lunatic fringe. And that makes the radicals madder than anything.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life reading this ridiculous drivel 
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 I am a teacher at a new school, and this was a mandatory read for all faculty and students. This Tracy Kidder book is about a man who has sacrificed a lot for people who are in desperate need. I applaud Paul Farmer for his work and giving nature. However, I question his parental abilities and dedication to what should be the most important thing in his life: his family. He will most likely never be around to see his daughter grow up. His unselfish (?) actions towards the Haitian people put his family on a second level of importance. Who is going to be the father figure to his daughter if he is never there? What about the abandonment his wife must feel? How about sharing a romantic French meal with his wife? Why not put this in the book? Kidder spent more time describing the relationship with Ophelia than talking about the docter as a family man. The reason for many broken families in our society today is because there is no father figure around for the wives and children that need him the most.  Is he working for the greater good? Probably. Should he abandon his work? No, but maybe balance is a good thing. He seems to be a person who backs up his talk with action. A lot of people criticize without doing anything about the world's problems. Farmer is not one of those. He reinforces his ideals with personal committment. But one couln't help but notice the socialist undertones that he projected throughtout the heavy and tedious narration. Instead of blaming the Haitian Government for the woes and poverty of its people, for the corruption, for the heavy hand of the military, and educating Haitians on how to better their country, it was the US fault for building a dam. Farmer is admirable in many, but not every way.  The Kidder writing had its moments of dry humor and captivation. But my genuine interest was not tapped until the two female doctors' conundrum of taking John to the US. The high point was how Farmer and Kidder demonstrated how useless the United Nations and the WHO are: a burocracy that should learn a lesson from Farmer. Action not words.  As a literature and foreign language teacher I found the narration troublesome and politically skewed. Some of the Spanish translations were too literal. The descriptions seemed insincere and artificial. I lived in a third-world country for five years. Pulitzer Prize? Not this time! Is Paul Farmer an inspirational main character and a good role model: obviously in many ways. Is he flawless? I'll tell you when I get back from the my daughter's art class 
 I found this book almost impossible to read after the sixth chapter. It is so passe after few chapters that I recommend just skimming through if you have accidently, like me, bought this book.  In this book, Amartya Sen comes across as sooo 'Nirad C Choudhary'ish that it is unbelievable.   If the book was named: "India according to Rabindra Nath Tagore" it would have made more sense.  This book lacks originality and smacks of a typical Bengali Bhadralok (read wog) views, which can be attributed to any apologist for the west. He keeps talking about secularism and secularists (sic) ad nauseum without making any sense.  The following samples show a pathetic lack of understanding of the real issues and perceptions:  1. He quotes Nasidiya but delves in Hindu Fundamentalism! 2. Talks of blasphemy in the context of Hinduism! 3. Expounds Islam's traditions of tolerance! 4. And expects perfectability (sic), whatever it means.  This book is a total waste of money.  If you are really interested in India and Indians read "An Indian Affair - from Riches to Raj" by Archie Baron. That will be money well spent.  
 Oh dear...the Swamp Fox sounds more like The Graveyard Cat on this album. Tracks are definately not up to previous standards like Cool Town Woman, Stockhome Blues, etc, et 
 I know I'll get criticized for not "getting" this book.  I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this.  Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.  Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts.  The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today.  Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone.   
 This is a typical mathematical monograph which means it is densely written with almost no examples.  It's too bad since that makes decoding the text much more time  consuming 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 I had ordered this mother goose book, but I am not  comfortable reading it to my children. Here are some of the things said in this book "I had to go to London to buy me a wife," "Tom was beat," "give a barber a pinch of snuff," and "I'll grind his bones to make my bread." There are also two rhymes that include a thief who keeps stealing things until someone beat's him on the head and a kid telling a doctor that they don't like them for no reason at all. These are not things that I want to teach my child. This is a terrble book! I know these are classic nursery rhymes, but the are not politically correct and I wouldn't want my child repeating them 
 When purchasing this book it implied it was the actually text.  There was no picture of the book, so I ordered it.  This is a supplement to the text titled CRAM 101.  It has blank areas for notes and definitions.  It is not even a true study guide.  
 As a made for TV movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a Saturday afternoon that you watch because you don't feel like changing the channel, it was okay. As the sequel to GWTW or the screen adaptation of the book I enjoyed reading so much, it was appallingly AWFUL. The acting was weak, and the woman that played Scarlett was mildly attractive at best. It was a complete waist of time and money 
 I found this book at the library, tucked in between a Dr. Sears book and a book on weaning.  It looked like intriguing, and I expected it to be a book that helped to "normalize" the view of breastfeeding, showing simple vignettes of the realities (both good and bad).  Something more enjoyable to read than a "how to" manual. There is some of that.  In fact some of the short stories are priceless.  However, there are also many disturbing images which definately are not going to help to encourage breastfeeding or enlighten anyone about the reality of breastfeeding.   In fact, some of the more controversial stories (the ones about adult lactational fetishes or porn) only play off societies misguided beliefs that breastfeeding is or should be taboo.  The author mistakingly uses the term "breastfeed" to apply to a variety of uses for the breast, including non nutritive.  If the authors intent was to stir up thought and meaningful discussion about the subject of breastfeeding in our society, these stories detract from any of the positive messages included.   In my opinion the subjects of milk men, induced lactation, extended nursing and cooking with breastmilk are controversial enough for society.  The pornographic issues belong in a seperate book.   I would not reccomend this for anyone who is looking for more information on nursing in general, or who is considering breastfeeding but hasn't made up their mind yet.   Its a nice try, the idea of a book of vignettes that reveal the many different facets of lactation is definately something that I'd like to see on the market.  But this one goes too far.  
 For an accurate biblical view of Israel read or listen to, "The Future of Israel" by John MacArthur 
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating 
 in the hills of beverly.  Spoiled rich bratty kids snorting their lives up their plastic surgeonized noses.  How sweet.  James Spader was good as the sleazy drug pusher, what happened to him, he had real potiential to be a fine actor.   Robert Downey,Jr. is terrific in any part he takes.  Jamie Gertz reminds me of Tori Spelling, she has to be related to some big shot, how else does she get hired? She can't act and she's not even pretty or even busty.  Like Pam Anderson, would anybody remember her without her big oversized boobies?   I doubt it.  Enjoy 
 I am more than a little interested in historical accounts of piracy, especially those dealing Grace O'Malley, and other female mariners.  I selected this book hoping for more stories of the same, and was instead bored to tears by the author's accounts of her trip, the countryside, the places she stayed.. On and On.  I got no new information about Grace or anyone else.  It seemed like the author did not find enough information about these "legendary women" and needed to pad the book with her adventures.  I personally would reccomend "She Captians" or Anne Chambers biography of Grace O'Malley over this book 
 The Author is a neurologist and a Zen practitioner.  His skill at the field of neurology; I will reserve comment until I obtain sufficient information to form a credible opinion.  The information about Zen; is terroble at least in the beginning. I was only able to complete the first thirty pages before throwing the book down in disgust because he tells some things about zen that "just ain't so."  Page 7. "The Zen of which we speak is an ancient sect of mahayana Buddhism."  Zen is NOT Mahayana Buddhism. Zen is neither fish nor fowl.   Zen began in China and was called chan (sitting meditation) Buddhism began in India, when Buddhism was taken to China; the Chinese state religion was Taoism.   Zen is an outgrowth of the two philosophies Buddhism and Taoism. Chan practitioners borrowed parts of each philosophy, and chan was born as a third and seperate philsophy. the  name was changed to Zen after chan was taken to Japan.  Page 8. "Chan also drew some of it's ethical base from Confucianism"  Confucius lived about the same time of Buddha (sidhartha Gautama), and by the time Chan was introduced Confucianism had been replaced with the state religion pf Taoism. It's a mice story; but isn't so.  Page 8. "Thus it gradually evolved into what Kobori-roshi would later describe as a strange dragon with a Taoist torso, Confucian feet and the Buddhist enlightenment-experience for it's eyes.  I documented earlier that Taoism had replaced Confucianism as the state religion before the birth of zen, and I thought the author said on page 7 that Zen was Mahayana Buddhism?  Page 13. "Authentic Zen will not be drawn into such artificial "minn gyms"."  What is a gym? a gymnasium where a person goes to play a sport or to exercize. Zen IS all about exercizing the mind so you can awaken to your True Nature, and silence the monkey mind.  Page 14. "Zen shuns halucinations and dogmatism"  Excuse me Mr. Austin; but one can NOT awaken to their True Nature without going through the mental state called makyo where your mind will generate all sorts of visual AND sometimes audible halucinations.  As I said earlier' I was only able to stand about the first thirty pages before throwing the book down in disgust. The Zen instruction may get better; but I DO know the author puts a lot of garbage about Zen in the mind of the readers.  If you want to learn Zen; start here.  Entry level.  "Taking The Path Of Zen" Robert Aitken "Zen: Lessons From A Modern Master" Katsukui Sekida  Experienced  "Zen Training: Methods And Philsophy" Katsuki Sekida "Three Pillars Of Zen" Phillip Kapleau  For more books check my listmania list for Zen books  Zen was the first meditation system I learned at the age of 12 when studying martial arts.   I am nearly 52 now. I have practised taoist, guided, Hawaiian, Jewish, and several other forms of meditation over the years; but I always seem to find myself wandering back to Zen after a few weeks to months 
 I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it.  Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost.  Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book.  There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them 
 I read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security. It does not. In fact, it glosses over the key, overriding issue: that the so-called "social security trust fund" does not in fact exist. The claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an IOU that the government writes to itself.   The book spends all of one paragraph (see page 28) on this critical issue, suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds, rather than government bonds, and concluding, "It is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund's portfolio should make any difference." I just about threw the book across the room at that point! In other words, the authors see no difference between a fund backed by real assets that can simply be sold and a fund that will require raising taxes or additional borrowing on an enormous scale 
 Santayana is known broadly as the guy who said that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it -- whatever that means. And therein lies, in miniature, the charm of this tireless windbag, most of whose vast output is thankfully out of print. The statement in itself means precisely nothing, and its perfect emptiness is what renders it most useful. It requires a trememdous volume of ignorance to make Santayana profound, which is, I suppose, why he was for so long America's national philosopher. If you expect philosophers to be blowhards, then Santayana will never disappoint you. For the rest of us, instead of this volume and the five-volume bolus of which it is the condensate, one can read William James' essay "The Sentiment of Rationality," the wisdom of which it, as it were, repeats 
 This movie is very gross. This movie is horrible. The movie is a disgrace to the movie industry. I am so glad that I had got this cheap. I will be getting rid of it. It would be an insult to my dvd collection for me to keep this video.   This movie is a waste of everything used to make this movie. It was also a big waste of my time.  "Howard the Duck" was better than this.  This movie was just flat out horrible.!!!!  I used to collect GPK stickers  I thought they were cool. To see this movie I am just apalled I didn't know there was a movie out there so horrible. 
 I am very disappointed in this book.  I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks.  Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine.  He said never to use the "V-shape" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book.  The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place.  My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists.  I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines.  It was not.  
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 Schwartz is a new-ager who believs in ghosts, psychics, and talking to the dead, and he says these things can be proven scientifically. Why must people who believe in goofball ideas try to legitimize them by using scientific terms? They must believe no reasonable person would believe them otherwise, and they are right.  Unfortunately, the "scientific evidence" Schwartz presents would not impress a six-year-old. In his big "experiment" he got a guy named Chris who said he was psychic to write down some items he said he dreamed, such as a pile of tires and a bunch of umbrellas. Then they walked around town until they saw some tires and umbrellas. Wow, that's impressive. Schwartz was so impressed he says "I literally could not breathe" (page 20). I assume he dropped dead, but no, he went on another walk with Chris, who said he dreamed of seeing some trees and grass. You'll never guess what happened. They walked around until they saw some trees and grass. This guy Chris is amazing. Schwartz? Not so much. Later he takes pains to say he is not a numerologist, and then describes his obsession with the number 11 and how he sees it everywhere he looks for it. As Schwarts often says, give me a break! He claims to have been a professor at Harvard and Yale and says he is a university teacher. Surely this cannot be true; at the least, it does not reflect well on Harvard and Yale. If any university is currently paying him a salary for indoctrinating young minds with his new age speculations, someone should tell them about this book. 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 I dislike being a conformist but I have to go with the crowd here when I say "Huh?"  I loved the Griffin & Sabine series but the Matthew/Isabella reprisal just left me confused and mostly dissatisfied.  To give Nick Bantock credit though, the Griffin & Sabine series was more creative than anything I will ever achieve in my life, so I'll give him snaps for that and move on 
 Pathetic.  Almost as bad as Bloodrayne.  It would seem Andrzej Bartkowiak knew nothing of the game.  Altough I did not go into this expecting it to be "spot on" with the story-line of the game, they could have at least tried to make the attempt.  The creators of Doom the game deserved better than this movie 
 Mr. Halberstam continues his decline as a serious journalist. This odious valentine to the 50's Red Sox should come complete with a hanky. Ted Williams & co. deserve better 
      I found this book both disappointing and sad.  The author clearly has a God paradigm that isn't working. This book is devoted to desperately trying to make it work.       First, Crabbe describes a God who has made written promises that He (God) doesn't reliably keep (healing, provision, and protection being prime).  Then, when a person is in intense emotional and/or physical pain due to God's unkept promises or sheer inaction, Crabbe's God emotionally abandons them.  God (alias "the comforter" in some circles) just up and leaves the person to tough it out on their own.       The book's "redeeming" idea seems to be that, at this point of emotional abandonment, the person becomes so utterly crushed and broken, shattered and literally terrified, they are finally either (1) able to encounter God because life has become horribly dark and meaningless thanks to God (who could have prevented this whole situation but didn't), or (2) they are writhing in pain for relief and simply don't know where else to turn, except to keep turning back the "higher power" who has already abandoned them.  (As God is a liar who repeatedly doesn't keep promises, and an abandoner who has promised comfort, then leaves;  this is getting weirdly close to looking like a child who keeps returning to an abusive parent.)       For the person at this shattering life nadir, having an intense but unmet desire/hunger for God is depicted in the book as an intermediate level of "doing great".       Yet, if they are doing great enough to finally "find" God, the God they meet at this point is an angry, harsh, lightening-throwing Calvinistic God who is furious at them for suggesting that they deserve anything. In fact, Jesus has to protect us from this God by throwing himself between the cowering sufferer and the lightening bolt of God's indignant anger which he has just hurled at the sinful "arrogant" sufferer.  (This is depicted as establishing for the sufferer that Jesus is his best friend.)       After that, the book quickly ends, giving the reader little help in how to balance his newfound "joy" with the ongoing misery of his life, agonizing pain, and unmet needs.  How exactly does this work?  The few paragraphs devoted to this sound rather like God has put the person on some kind of drug therapy, i.e. due to your new "joy", the fact that your whacked-out-on booze kid storms into the house at 4 a.m. just isn't quite as important anymore.  It's  hard to get a grip on the "feeling state" in this type example.       You know . . . if this is really how it works, then I hope it is simply all over when I die.  This God is a nightmare.       I actually agree with the idea that suffering, to a point, can turn us toward God. In fact, I even agree that suffering may play an essential role in the journey toward God.  But I don't like the way Crabbe's God is positioned relative to our suffering, and I don't like the picture of God Crabbe paints.       Horrible unaddressed suffering is not always redemptive -- it can destroy a person (and others around that person).  Crabbe doesn't discuss if God ever crosses that line.  Or if the line to destruction is crossed, who crossed it?  And how?  Is this a God we can trust?  For what?  Is this God really "on our side", or is this God basically out to enhance his own "glory"?         Crabbe is quite admirably honest about the problems he has encountered in relating to God.  If a reader has had similar problems, then reading his candid stories could be cathartic.  On a more individual note, Crabbe seems to have personal guilt about having arrogantly yelled at God for more blessings when he already seems to have a ton.  If a reader with lots of blessings has assumed God owes it to them to make their life even more perfect, then this will also be relatable.     But the heavy-handed contortions Crabbe goes through near the book's end to reconcile his genuinely disturbing experiences with some very unattractive theology is quite discouraging -- even alarming -- and not helpful for either God's reputation or for maintaining faith.     Joy is not very well defined or described in this book.  But under Crabbe's scenario, could anyone but a masochist set out to find "joy"?  And if they found it, what kind of God would they have to rely on, from that point forward?      Based on past experience, maybe this God would just decide one day to jerk the rug out from under one's hard-won "joy"?  And if so many of these other promises aren't kept, then why should a person believe this God's promises about heaven are true?   
 I have never read a Walter Mosely book an frankly had no desire to do so.  This month's book club member chose this book; since it is the 10th book in a series, it clearly was a poor choice.  Anyway, I spent yesterday listening to this book on tape.  It was literally unbearable.  Why exactly is this book set in the 60's?  From all the reviews, there clearly is a group of people living in the past and this is sad.  I couldn't get anything out of this book other than the fact that Feather had a blood disease and Easy needed money to send her to Switzerland for treatment.  It took Easy so long, isn't it likely that Feather is dead by now?  The book was cheesy, poorly written and simply bordered on the ridiculous.  The book also left many key plot issues unresolved. I can't imagine someone choosing to read this series voluntarily 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 This book is the most extreme that I have ever read about. It advocates eating ONLY alkaline foods, citrus,avocados, bananas, almonds, etc. It eliminates your freedom to ever eat any quantity of acidic foods all red meat, pork, most fruits, and everthing processed. The flaw in this author's theory is the fact that the body is able to moderate its internal PH by excreting extra acid through the urine.Yes, I agree with him that over eating acidic foods all the time will cause your body to retain water and body fat and tax your eliminating organs. I also agree that following his diet plan of drinking greens, 5 liters of water a day and eating only vegatables and small amounts of fish will cause you to loose dramatic amounts of weight, but who can live like that for an extended amount of time? Read The acid-alkaline diet by Christopher Vasey, N.D. for a more realistic and balanced approach. Read Mastering the Zone by Barry Sears for a diet you can live with for the rest of your life. I went from 209 to 151 on the Zone diet and have never gained it back.Read the Superfoods Healthstyle for a truly  realistic healthy lifestlye. 
 Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
 This book is a complete waste of paper.  The reader is subjected to page after page of disgustingly graphic descriptions of diarrhea (the author's), flatulence (the radio man's), the construcion and instructions for use of Afghan toilets and, not least, the "fact" that Afghan men wear long shirts so they can move their bowels in public and remain covered while doing so.  The author also appears to burst into tears at the slightest provocation (perhaps he bores himself to tears!) 
 this thing sucked.  it couldnt detect worth crap. oh except for the gum wrappers and the metal under concrete. I give it zero out of five stars but it made me put one. I lost a coin testing it. DO NOT BUY! unless you want to waste time and money 
 See the rare spectacle of Sean Connery covered in mud (or chocolate pudding) while maintaining a straight face! Hear Brian Keith's contrived Russian accent! Experience some of the worst special effects in film history! "Meteor" gives new meaning to the term "disaster movie." Unfortunately, a better-than-necessary cast is trapped in the wreckage -- including Henry Fonda as the President of the United States. Good for a few unintentional laughs 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
                The major problem with this book is Shiller's basic misconception of what the major problem is concerning decision making about the future ,given the incomplete amount of relevant information available in the past and the present,based on what D.Ellsberg called ambiguous probabilities,  J M Keynes called probabilities with low weight(uncertainty),and Benoit Mandelbrot called wild risk(as opposed to the mild risk of the normal probability distribution).Shiller bases his understanding on the "new"behavioral economics associated with the work of Tversky,Kahneman,Thaler,etc.This kind of approach emphasizes not the major problems of ambiguity,uncertainty,or wild risk of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot,but relatively mild problems associated with the Allais Paradox(certainty,reflection,translation,and preference reversal effects plus other assorted anomalies).The problem is that the Tversky-Kahneman approach ,and other associated approaches allied with them, are based fundamentally on the view that the normal distribution is the  correct  distribution to use for educated,rational decision makers.The problem ,then,is that decision makers in general are not rational;they are irrational and uneducated decision makers ,who allow their emotions,combined with their hopes and fears,to influence their decision making .All the anomalous behavior can be traced to the basic irrationality and ignorance of decision makers,who supposedly resort to all kinds of heuristic shortcuts because they have not mastered the fields of statistics and probability correctly.The position of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot is completely different.The decision maker is rational,but must "rely" on probabilities that he knows are unreliable,vague,ambiguous,unclear,and uncertain.In such a world the attempt to gain additional information,as in the stock market,leads to herd,crowd,and cascade effects as each individual decision maker attempts to obtain a little, additional amount of relevant information from other sources that he feels are better informed.Thus,it is the ambiguity or uncertainty of the future that leads to the creation of bubbles,manias,panics,and crashes.These events have little to do with the Tversky-Kahneman approach.The normal probability distribution is completely worthless as a guide to action in the stock market and other financial markets in the face of ambiguity ,uncertainty,or wild risk.In his preface(pp.ix-x),Shiller claims that"...economic thinkers have been limited by the state of relevant risk management principles of their day".Shiller claims that Keynes did not have command of such risk management ideas.The fact is that Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot have forgotten more about these ideas than Shiller will ever know.All seven of Shiller's new types of markets and new types of insurance totally ignore the fundamental problem of ambiguity/uncertainty.They are put forth in the misbelief that the kind of decision making problems examined by Tversky-Kanheman are the main explanation for the boom-bust nature of financial markets , the volatility that results,and the unstable nature of such markets  in a capitalist system.Shiller needs to completely rewrite this book and base it on a foundation of Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot 
 *  Thanks, everybody! Due in large part to your reviews I have decided to heed your warnings and skip past this "turkey"! Because of your "common consensus," as it were, "curiousity" will by no means kill THIS particular "cat"!   Yes, I felt the very powerful urge to experience this version of "WotW," especially after (1)- hearing repeatedly how amazingly "faithful" this version was to Mr. Wells' original vision and (2)- having been SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED (to 'gag-reflex' levels) by Steven Spielberg's drippy-syrupy, happy-sappy, and completely illogical abomination of the same source material (replete with the otherwise lovely & talented Dakota Fanning's irritating "Screaming Mimi" performance).   So despite all of the "warnings" about the "bad acting," the "bad editing," the "bad cinematography," and the "bad special effects," I still played around with the idea that its faithfulness to the original story would more than make up for all of this film's many production faults -- or that I could at least overlook such faults, as I often am capable of doing when presented with an entriguing-enough story to involve myself in ("Sleepaway Camp," anyone?). But the more I read of your reviews, the more doubts I began to have, until it led me to do the ONE thing I had yet to do -- VIEW THE TRAILERS! Therefore allow me, please, to repeat EVERYTHING which has repeatedly been expressed throughout these reviews based solely on my observation of the three "theatrical" trailers I viewed of this movie:   * less-than-impressive cinematography  * stale/wooden (read: "awful") acting  * uninspiring & amateurish special effects  * incompetent editing   That this is the closest "by the book" film adaptation we have of the original story seems, to me, to be this film's only major (if not exclusive) selling point.   I have this uncanny ability to "look beyond" poorly produced/directed/acted films in favor of a "good story" (or, at least, a "decent" one), but I simply CANNOT bear to sit through such a high concentration  of these cinematic deficits all pressed neatly together into one complete package! If only a series of motion picture promotional "trailers" can cause me to utterly reject ANY AND EVERY interest in a film project I may have initially had & held onto quite so effectively, then I can only consider myself SPARED of even greater disappointment from something that was surely to be a much more horrendous experience 3-hours in length! From all that I have observed and read, I do not even believe (as many of you seem to do) that a "larger budget" would have made one bean of difference!   Thank you, my friends, from the very bottom of my heart! Thank you for your help in saving me from a fate not exactly "worse-than-death" but pretty damn close!    = = = = = = 
 A marketing dream, no doubt, the European release of "Further Down the Spiral" differed in several tracks from the US release.  Largely, my review for the US release is relevant to this one, but there's four different tracks on here that weaken the overall quality of the record.  As a rule, the remixes are clever, inventive, and great at changing mood, at a sense of heightened tension to the material.  The best stuff from the US release is on here as well-- dark and moody retreads like "The Art of Self-Destruction, Part one" and "The Downward Spiral (the bottom)" and fantastic reinventions like the Rick Rubin "Piggy (nothing can stop me now)", but missing is a pile of great "Eraser" remixes, the "quiet" version of "Hurt", and a 'self-destruct' remix.  "Self Destruction, Part Three" sits in for part two, again by J.G. Thirwell, and is somewhat less interesting-- sounds like a single mix quite honestly, and the live version of "Hurt" in place of the quiet version is kind of a whatever substitution.  Neither of them is particularly intriguing or additive.  And the two Charlie Clouser remixes ("Heresy" and "Ruiner") I'm just not sure what to say about them.  Clouser turned them both into dance songs, nice beats and "Heresy" has some effective sample use, but neither piece is anything I really found worthwhile.  Bottom line on this one, stick with the US release unless you're a completionist 
 I just sold this back through Amazon, I was so disapointed with it. It's an all cover record, and while Greg Duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers, all of the music feels too subdued, too flat.  Duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the Whigs and the first Twilight Singers recording. 
 How could anyone think that Jennifer Love Hewitt looks or acts anything like audrey? who in thier right mind could see this gangly, ungraceful, talentless, squinty has-been as one of the most beloved actresses/humanitarians of our time? Its blasphemy and I am glad this movie tanked. 
 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 Like other readers, I found myself extremely put off by the author's unfathomable condescension towards platforms other than Windows XP, browsers other than Internet Explorer 6, and monitors either smaller or larger than the norm.  Would that it stopped there.  He also goes out of his way to insult standards bodies, programmers, and even animators who haven't switched to all-digital production.    Beyond the blatant callousness of his remarks, there is a serious weakness here for a book coming out under the otherwise excellent ...Dummies line: It's simply not good business, for two reasons:  1) Even if people who don't use standard and software and equipment are used to seeing Web pages that don't work properly, that doesn't mean that it doesn't alienate them.  If I were the owner of a small business, I simply wouldn't want to hire a Web designer who is cheerfully willing to cut my sales by even as much as 5%.  It's bad business.  In particular, a lot of people who use old software do so because they are overwhelmed by the relentless press to upgrade or simply can't afford it.  Yes, IE6 is free--but XP isn't.    2) Standards are not static, nor is software.  Within the next year or so, the dominant platform is likely to be Vista and the dominant browser IE7 (or later).  The best way to guarantee that my Web pages will continue to work with future software and standards is to make sure that they're conformant now.  Again, if I were looking from the perspective of a business owner, I wouldn't want to have to rehire my Web designer (or, more likely, a different one) in two or three or five or ten years because the non-standard CSS they wrote now stopped working, soley because they made the lazy assumption that the only browser one needs to support is IE6.    I'm really astonished that the editor at Wiley let this one out the door.  
 This product is attractive and works efficiently; however, my unit produced toxic smelling water the first 5 times I tested it out.  I will try a metal electric kettle next 
 This book had very little to reveal about Masonary or Magic. The author does include copies of spells he uses with brief discriptions of how to use them, but over all the book lacked any real meat 
 I think I only liked one of her recipes.  The rest of them weren't original 
 I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray. 2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!    Good points: -pop off tray -divider that keeps them from slipping out -cool colors  I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less 
 No doubt, Austin is a "singer's singer" and still at the top of her game. She deserves an album that showcases that to top effect, but it's not "In And Out Of Love". Narada Michael Walden's sterling  production on the first few songs gets the project off to a promising  start. Then Louis Biancaniello takes over. His bland, even cheap-sounding,  synth arrangements and musicianship fail to give Austin the support she  truly deserves; at times, it even mars his far better follow-up with  Austin, "Street Of Dreams". The saving grace of "In And Out  Of Love" are the vocals. True fans (me included) will appreciate the  opportunity to hear the soulful, energetic, but always tasteful Austin (she  has few equals for singing ballads) on record again. However, nothing here  really comes close to her work on Quincy Jones' Qwest/Warner label nor her  earlier work on CTI. If you want first rate Patti Austin, try the folliwng:  "The Real Me", "Gettin' Away With Murder" and  especially her performances on Jones' "The Dude" and  "Sounds". The latter includes what may be her best moment on  record, "Love Me By Name" 
 This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.  If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.  The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however 
 I found this book while trying to find a book I first heard about in the early 80's.  I believe the title was something like "Contact: The First Three Seconds".  I'm hoping someone will read this and assist me with the actual title and/or Author of the book 
 McKnight's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate, but disturbingly overstated in this book.     In the end I felt McKnight's trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.  He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.  Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well, since in McKnight's picture, social programs and the professional service providers are, in fact, the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.    One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.  Mcknights views resonate with employers' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or, perhaps, health insurance.     What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.  It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.  In this, I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit, when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them, and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.    But McKnight's model for today's cure doesn't seem to fit today's conditions.  On the other hand, McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend. 
 This is a good overview, albeit very superficial, of the factors that drove the irrational exhuberance of the late 90s.  The role of the financial media, the so-called stock analysts, and others is explored and the consequence of the synergistic effects on the collective mind of the suckers who invested in the dot.com companies is highlighted.  Despite the book develops a dry topic, the book is an easy read; it reads well and will most certainly capture the interest of many readers.  On the negative side, this book can hardly be regarded as objective; the author has most certainly an ideological resentment against the Fed and Greenspan in particular.  This is not necessarily a bad thing - however, the criticism revolves around serious innacuracies in terms of the outlook and the role of Greenspan and the Fed in the NASDAQ crash.     It is unfortnate that the author had to resort to blatant lies when describing how the Fed and Greenspan viewed the role of the Internet and the growth of the dot.com stock bubble.  Readers looking for a an interesting non-fiction book, may be keen to read this book but serious analysts of the background of the NASDAQ debacle should look elsewhere - the inaccuracies are far too overwhelming. 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 Reading this book, I find that the author's ego interferes often with the documentation of how America went from Haute cuisine to the modern "American" restaurant.  One particular passage paints his mother (a cook) in the same light as Elizabeth David and M.F.K.Fisher, and leaves me wondering why, if she was so enlightened, do I not see her book on the shelf.  Throughout the book, he comes off as an average cook that could no longer take the heat, and left the kitchen to write.  With about 30 pages left to go, I cringe each time I reach for the book to attempt to finish it as what the author must perceive as colorful writing becomes more laborious with each page.  That said, there is definitely some interesting information, and if you can indeed labor through some of its issues, and weave around the author's bias, you will be somewhat rewarded.  (I especially found some of the La Pavillion information interesting after finishing Jacques Pepin's autobiography.)  Bottom line - if you are seriously interested in reading about American gastronomy, this might we worth a look if you can pick a copy up cheap.  I only wish someone with more skill had taken on the project, as it was, in fact, an excellent idea for a book 
 Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim) 
 all you manager types. you know who you are you read 'who moved the cheese' and jesus ceo, this is the mag for you lame, trite and oh so self importen 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 This little book is really a "coffee table" book for those who enjoy these kinds of compilations, but don't expect much from this one.   Each page has a very short line about "why a daughter needs a mom..." i.e., "to read to her," "who can play on her level," "to listen closely to what troubles her," etc. etc.     I found nothing overly moving or memorable here, in fact, the black and white photographs accompanying each of the 100 Reasons do nothing to bring these pages to life.  Most photos are clearly contrived portraits of "everyday-type" models posing to reflect the sentiment on the page.   None of them look spontaneously photographed to capture a feeling or a moment.  I'm assuming that the author, Gregory E. Lang, aimed at tearing at the heartstrings, but I'm not so sure it was accomplished here in that you'll find very little originality and even less to keep you turning the pages to read more.  By the time I got to Reason #100 (...because without her she will have less in her life than she deserves) we are pretty much bored and will think twice before giving this book as a gift.    I'm both a mom AND a daughter, and I normally love these kinds of books, dedicated to capturing the feelings and sentiments behind family bonds, but this one just doesn't hit the mark.  Save your $ 
 Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! 
 I expected something different in terms of his music. At the same time I received the product promptly and in great condition 
 The new version of this book is now being sold under a different title: "The Corporate Records Handbook". Don't buy this old version 
 Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund.  I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem.   The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards.   I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV.   I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards). 
 Sallie Ann Glassman is not a Mambo! She does attempt to pimp Lwa for her performances and for her weekly "ceremonies". Any serious Mambo and Hougan (and even practitioner of Haitian Vodou) will laugh when they hear the following: Sallie Ann Glassman's "house" does not have grades! Traditional Haitian Vodou knows 3 grades of initiation! Sallie Ann Glassman does not perform the Priye Ginea because it was Catholic... she opted for an invocation to the four directions and four elements lifted from either the OTO or Wicca or Enochian tradition, but done in French, to sound like Creole - so the average tourist would not know that it was just some invocation from another tradition that had nothing to do with Vodou. When she takes people to Haiti for initiation (remember: no grades!) she gives them Pot Tets filled with a feather and 2 or 3 other items. She does not teach passwords or handshakes to her initiates - who, again, have not received any grade! To make a long story short, this book and the author are great bogus and have NOTHING to do with real Haitian Vodou 
 This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as "B".....  This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; " Fugetaboutit"!! He is a long, long way from the Masters .. 
 Wow. This is a BAD film. Where to begin? The young cast is talented and appealing but the writing completely lets these talented youngsters down. Was it written for 14-year-olds or by 14-year-olds? Comparing it to those shallow but well-intentioned ABC after-school specials from the 70s is insulting to the latter. Also, it is incredibly offensive that 25 years after "Fame" we still are subjected to the sad, doomed Paul McCrane gay character (who cross-dresses, naturally), living unrequited and unfulfilled -- in the final scenes he must content himself with watching the straight boy and girl find the happiness denied him. Todd Graff's heart is obviously in the right place, but please Todd, hire a real writer of some depth next time. The score is marvelous, however, and deserves a better film. There are some rare comic moments, but not enough to recommend this film. In fact, adults should stay away from this stinker, only musical theater teens and pre-teens could possibly find this film engaging 
 I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often.  You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive 
 The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products 
 I have NEVER posted a review here before, but I was so disappointed in this DVD that I just had to speak on it.   Ok, this is a reissue of this DVD and it is missing so many skits from the original that it isn't even funny.  Just a few of the missing skits: 1.  Kill the white people.  2.  There are NO Gumby skits. 3.  There is only one Mr Robinson's Neighborhood skit where there should have been three. 4.  White people slavery town with Stevie Wonder. There are more, but I can't name them all.  If you can find the ORIGINAL buy it and buy it quickly.  You will laugh until you wet yourself.  You will remember what the golden age of SNL was really about.  Don't waste your money on this poor imitation.   
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck.  To be fair, Portugese director João Pedro Rodrigues has made some daring choices here. Dialogue is minimal--this might as well be a silent film with sound effects. He's working one of the great themes--the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary. There is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions. And yes, there is more than a little boundage mixed in. (This is no 50s MGM musical.) It looks good--night photography, lots of backlight and black surfaces, either dull or glittering. Sergio (played by Ricardo Meneses, a garbageman in Lisbon, drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer (and Sergio is pretty hunky himself). While not obsessing, he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another. Finally, he goes off the beam completely (I won't go into all the details in case you decide to see it).  The problem is the same that so many self-consciously arty films, from Greed to The Unbearable Lightness of Being, share--their metaphors are too obvious (here, among others, it's human and animal behavior--Sergio's best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically) and they are just too long. O Fantasma would make a pretty good 40 minutes festival film--at 90 minutes, it just drags, particularly the ending with Sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit. (Come to think of it, kind of an echo of the equally tedious final sequence of Greed.) I admit it--I really haven't the patience for films that scream out how ARTFUL they are and have little or nothing except style, attitude, and angst. Style and attitude--think Fred Astaire--can be a winning combination. Unfortunately, in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria, this is not a winning film. Basically, it's a bore 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I was disappointed there was not more substance to this novel.  Fitzgerald was less than halfway finished when he died, and the seventeen "completed" episodes were in obvious need of re-editing.  Judging from the author's notes, they would have been revised extensively anyway to fit his shifting vision of how the plot would evolve.  There are moments of clever satire on the Hollywood Industry (and especially its writers) that would probably have made the finished product well worth reading, but Fitzgerald was still struggling to balance the satirical tone of his novel with the love story of its protagonists.  The editor's notes were very helpful, though, inasmuch as they showed what direction Fitzgerald wanted to take and the alternate endings he had in mind 
 This book rates cities by several livability factors, then adds the ratings to determine who's #1 (it's Charlottesville, VA), who's #2 (Santa Fe, NM) . . . all the way down to who's #331 (Laredo, TX), dead last.  In doing so, the authors have inadvertently switched the ratings of cities with the same name: Columbia (Missouri and South Carolina), Columbus (Georgia and Ohio), Decatur (Alabama and Illinois), Florence (Alabama and South Carolina) Jackson (Michigan and Mississippi), Lafayette (Indiana and Louisiana) and Springfield (Illinois and Massachusetts).  For example: Florence (Alabama) gets Florence (South Carolina's) rosey score for employment, while the latter is saddled with the former's rather grim employment score.  Or, Jackson (Michigan) receives Jackson (Mississippi's) milder weather rating, while the latter is stuck with the former's rotten climate rating.  Since a city's ranking depends on the rankings of other cities, these astounding errors affect the final results of every other city listed in the book.  You can verify this yourself by comparing ratings summarized in the beginning of the book with ratings in each city's profile.  This book is a fraud.  If this had happened in health care or financial services, the authors would have been fired and their study withdrawn 
 As an avid sports fan that listens to Mike & Mike show, I found myself hooked on the witty banter both bring to the radio.  I found myself agreeing with Greeny on many different issues but also was happy to have someone representing the 'every man' point of view in dealing with sports.  Greeny is not the former player turned sportscaster and that was something most listeners could relate to.  It was with these thougths in mind that I looked forward to reading his new book.  This is not the Mike Greenberg I know...  Whomever came up with the notion that publishing a bunch of journal postings was a good idea should be fired on the spot.  Everything was loosely tied together and most were just ramblings of a man trying to come to grips with his priviledged life.  The readers should feel sorry for you because your nanny/maid took the same week off as your wife??!!  Suck it up and change a freakin' diaper!  This book is not for fans of the Mike & Mike show, it will ruin the broadcast.  Leave the book on the shelf and DO NOT BUY IT FOR THE SPORTS DAD ON FATHER'S DAY.  While they can get through it quickly enough, they'll be worse off having read it 
 Not to say there aren't some good dance tracks on here, they just aren't living up to today's standards. I think it's at the point where I need to stop buying mix CDs buy some of my favorite New York City DJs. These guys, including Rauhofer, Vasquez, etc...broke new ground back in the 90s with their progressive house music and mixes...but at this point, there's nothing "progressive" about it because it still sounds the same as it did nearly ten years ago! It's all blending into one big mish mosh of indistinguishable beats! This is the new millennium, and I really wish these guys would fine tune their sound to keep up with it. There's so much different stuff going on at this point. Just take a look at this track listing and you'll see proof that times have changed-there are NO major named artists on this CD featuring exclusive Rauhofer mixes, plus, we're even being given recycled tracks by Club 69, Cevin Fisher, etc.   If you like instrumental tribal still, you'll probably feel this groove. Vocal lovers avoid, because there are few vocals on here.    Tracks:  CD1  1. killing me...nick & Danny Chatelain (6:30) (slow paced, deep electronics voice, yawn) 2. Hoes in this house (george morel & armand pena groove mix)...ron carroll (5:38) (a remake of classic 90s bitch track by Toni Ski. Another Yawn) 3. New Love...FC Nond (6:09) (hard tribal with a few diva vocals oohing, aahing and yeahing) 4. Sixteen Years (plaza crew mix)...camorina (4:44) (great diva vocal-funky bass, has potential, but doesn't go anywhere) 5. I like old school (synchronized emotions remix)...miguel Picasso (5:22) (put me to sleep now-weak instrumental) 6. 8 letters (martijn ten velden & mark knights mix)...holmes ives (6:54) (female vocal, no punch) 7. I remember (solar groovy mix)...Niki B & Christian EFFE (6:15) (more hard tribal beats and deep male vocal speak) 8. Reconstruction: 2...Julian Poker (5:20) (tribal instrumental. Sleep enducing) 9. Love Is a Drug (Lance Jordan Beat mix)...Rosko (6:35) (Recent Billboard #1 dance track that's hard to find on CD-tribal, spoken male vocal) 10. Tanque Beats...Delgado (3:24) (instrumental tribal beats) 11. free your body...decibel (8:35) (slow paced hard tribal with a few male vocal samples in the middle. Repetitive and monotonous) 12. This is the Sound...Pedro Diaz (4:09) (tribal, male vocal speaking every now and then. This is the sound...of 1999)  CD2  1. I Look Good (hector Fonseca mix)...Club 69  (6:21) (not much different than any previous mix of this track) 2. People...DJ Bruno (5:04) (instrumental, pretty cool electro vibe) 3. Sex Secret (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...2 Raum Wohnung (7:04) (clunky but funky alternative vocal track) 4. I Can't Explain (steve lawler summer of love mix)...Bombdogs (8:04) (almost a trancy feel, female vocal. Good track) 5. Sunday trip...danny freakazoid (5:02) (more instrumental electrovibes) 6. first time (hector fonseca mix)...offer nissim (6:03) (another hot vocal track from Offer Nissim) 7. easy ride (dub)...tresca (4:17) (pulsing bass, but just doesn't go anywhere) 8. beta boy...trente moeller (5:18) (funky house, reminds me of a Green Velvet track) 9. love you some more (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...cevin fisher (7:59) (typical funky rauhofer sound, male vocal) 10. voyager...john tejada (3:45) (more Green Velvet-esque instrumental) 11. tooting warrior...mike Monday (4:59) (bouncy, upbeat instrumental) 12. believe in me (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...peter rauhofer (5:36) (That nightmare "you've gotta believe" sample that's been haunting us for over a decade. WHY??? Ending his disc with this sample is a clear sign that he's not looking ahead.... 
 It's not funny, unless you're a moron. It's not suspenseful. The "mystery" is predictable to anyone who has seen more than one television suspense show. The characters are hollow. The interaction is tedious. And despite some hopeful signs of drug use, there are no hallucinations or grand insights. In fact, this book is entropy, resurfaced, and should be recycled immediately so we can print something more stimulating on the pulp, like perhaps instruction manuals for screwdrivers 
    This Book has to many repeatitive things going on. It takes to long to even get to the meat, or in other words the things you want to know about. And it ends really bad! !  
 Jurassic 5 - Feedback (Interscope, 2006)  After dropping one great EP and two equally great albums, Jurassic 5 fans like myself were patiently waiting for their next batch of material. Then the unthinkable happened when one of the DJ's Cut Chemist bounced (so now there really are five members). With that, I was a little worried. The worries were justified when the J5's single, "Work It Out" featuring the Dave Matthews Band came out. I tried to like it but it was one of those blatant crossover jams and was missing that boom-bap sound of past J5 records. Unfortunately, that is one of the better songs from their underwhelming album, Feedback.  It seems that you never appreciate the DJ until he's gone and Cut Chemist's productions are SORELY missed on this album. It also seems like Cut Chemist was the glue that held J5 together, as the tracks sound unfocused and the rappers try their best to pull through but occasionally stumble. It doesn't help either that a lot of the bad tracks are at the beginning of the album like the out-of-character "Brown Girl" and the speed-rap "Baby Please". As for party jams, "In the House" is garbage but "Radio" fares a little better.  After "Work it Out" comes the better songs like the piano-driven tunes "Get it Together" and "Where We At". "Canto de Ossanha" is an instrumental closer and while DJ Nu-Mark does his thing, it pales in comparison to Cut Chemist's album closers. And it's a shame that the only track that stays true to the classic J5 sound is an interlude called "J Resume". It would have fit in perfectly on Quality Control.   Apparently, someone at Interscope must have wanted J5 to sell like their more famous labelmates 50 Cent and Eminem. That's why the songs sound the way they do and even with big-name producers behind them (Salaam Remi, Scott Storch, etc.), they don't hit. Truly the talents of Chali 2na and Soup, the group's premier lyricists, are wasted here. Hopefully for their next album, J5 will get over the loss of their great DJ and bounce back. Although the Feedback may not be positive, J5 may come back again. -EJ 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 Becarfel this is a region 2 release. Chances are that this will not play on your DVD 
 This was my own fault, but don't make the mistake I made, of thinking this is the Disney version.  It isn't 
 I felt that this book really just skims the surface of so much.  Maybe Dr. Brazelton just wants to give a little info so that you will buy his other books... but I was unimpressed with this book 
 Don't buy this book.  Please.  It is not worth the time, money or brain cells.  I recieved this book as a gift for my birthday (what are you trying to say Mom?).  I proceded to skim it enough to be competant enough to write this review, and then threw it directly in the trash can.  Where it belongs.    The book lists approximatly 25 different occasions in life and tries to show how to dress for them. Examples of some of these occasions are work, work casual, date, girls night out, casual wear, summer wedding, pregnancy.  For each occasion, the book has a cartoon picture of a "frumpy" girl and a "foxy" girl.  The author then attempts to explain how to be the foxy girl and not the frumpy girl.  Unfortunatly her advice consists mainly of her repeating advice that anyone with half a brain would already know.    Take her "work casual" chapter as an example.  Her "frumpy" cartoon girl comes to work wearing jeans with holes, a dirty "kiss me I'm Irish" tee shirt, and an old bookbag.  Unless you work in a coal mine, you already know that this kind of outfit is obviously a big no any day of the week.  Her "foxy" cartoon is what you would expect - nice jeans, blouse, heels.  Duh.  The advice is equally as dumb.  Since my copy of "Frumpy" is in a landfill somewhere, I can't exactly quote, but I know it goes something like this - "Like, don't dress like that frumpy girl on the left!  Like yeah!  Dress like the foxy girl on the right!  And like don't like wear jeans with holes in them!"  Okay maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit but trust me.  Her advice tells you nothing.    The thing that makes me so angry about this book is, it's insulting!  This woman acts as if you have no idea whatsoever how to dress yourself.  The pictures make you feel bad because even the so-called frumpy girls are hot!  And the advice is stuff that you already know how to do and are probably already doing.  Such as brushing your teeth in the morning.  I'm not joking, that is actual advice from the book!  The worst part is the little "about the author" section.  It basically says that this chick and her friend out in California somewhere decided to write this book because they wanted to help the rest of the clueless masses dress more like them.  Yeah... those are two people I NEVER WANT TO MEET.  If you really want to change your style for the better, I would reccomend Kendall Farr's book "Pocket Stylist."  She actually shows you how to shop and dress better for all occasions, unlike the woman who wrote "Frumpy to Foxy."  I urge you, please don't make Ms. Rubin's wallet or ego any fatter than it already is 
 This DVD is fine for beginners who would like some stretching, but there is no weight loss aspect to it. I felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight 
 What a waste of time.  There is no spirit of realization behind the words.  It just made me want to go direct and read the words of Parmahansa Yogananda directly and not waste time on this ego trip 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 I have just finished reading Styron's book Darkness Visible and I have to say that I was quite under whelmed. The reader is left with little insight into Styron's battle with severe depression. Maybe this is just me, but I find that writers seem capable of expressing their feelings of despair and suicide in only in the loftiest of literary terms. Their writing screams, "I'm famous, well respected and admired, therefore I cannot express myself the way that an ordinary person would. That would be too plebeian." That and the frequent name dropping made me feel alienated from the author. For this reason the reader gets no clear understanding of the nature of his depression. We get glimpses but don't feel privy to his deepest thoughts. In fact, I cannot fathom why he even wrote the book. It certainly doesn't speak to the common people - especially those of us who have spend our lives trying to get the mental health system to advocate for us. Many of us are treated more like criminals than someone with a disease that needs adequate treatment - something that is not going to be found in the state mental health institutions in which the ordinary person is held.  Styron's recovery is almost an afterthought. After spending weeks in a psychiatric hospital (I would guess McLean), he is cured. How is he cured - time. Give the illness enough time and the patient will get better. Actually, in my own experience as someone with severe depression with multiple suicide attempts, the passage of time does place a barrier between my suicidal thoughts and my recovery. But time alone does not cure - it postpones. On page 75 (soft cover) Styron states, "Save for the awfulness of certain memories, acute depression inflicts few permanent wounds." Well, bully for him. But I think that he would find most depressives in disagreement with this statement. At least for myself, my depression has left deep wounds for the past 30 years or so.  Apparently, this was Styron's only episode of depression and thoughts of suicide (unless he has relapsed since this book was published). He attributes the causes of his depression to the loss of his mother, his father's illness, abstaining from alcohol (alcohol and mental illness are not a good mix and only worsen a person's symptoms), and turning 60. It's great that he can pinpoint so precisely the origins of his illness. For many people depressed and suicidal we just can't point to the causes of our illness. As research on the brain advances, we know that chemical imbalances in the brain have a lot to do with many mental illnesses. But ask someone who attempts suicide why they wanted to hurt themselves and many times your answer will be, "I don't know - I just don't know."  On page 76 he states, "Most people in the grip of depression at its ghastliest ..... may require on the part of friends, lovers, family, admirers [!], an almost religious devotion to persuade the sufferers of life's worth, which is so often in conflict with a sense of their own worthlessness, but such a devotion has prevented countless suicides." In my experience and that of others, family and friends have no clue as to how to help a person in so much pain. They want to help and be supportive but they don't know how. And who can expect them to? Yes, having support is gratifying but in the end not as helpful as one would hope. For myself, "such devotion" has never stopped me from hurting myself or attempting suicide. When the despair is so great and the spiral down into the abyss is impossible to climb out of, thoughts of family, friends, loved ones are completely absent from my mind. They're gone - insignificant. The only hope is that someone or something can grab my hand and pull me out of that bottomless hole.  Also lacking insight is Styron's statement on 77. He writes about a camaraderie with a celebrated [what else would we expect from Mr. Styron's coterie of friends and admirers] newspaper columnist and good friend who was manic depressive. Because of the commonality of their illnesses, they have "engender[ed] lasting fellowship." So hey, one of the perks of those feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, anguish and pain is that you might be lucky enough to find yourself a good friend.  This is the first time that I have read an account of a man's experience with mental illness. It is not my intention to sound sexist, but my experience in reading women authors writing about their battles with mental illness is that they are much more candid and forthright. I suppose that Styron's stilted and abbreviated account of his recovery from depression could just be the difference in which the opposite genders express their innermost thoughts. 
 This book was so boring I really did not learn anything the book was full or errors. I fell asleep on this one please don't write anymore books. 
 This is an excellent book for beginners in the field of electronics and Robotics. It shows you how to start working with electronics with lots of photographs which clearly illustrate what needs to be done, for example how to use a multimeter and the helping hands and tools required. It also introduces one to mechanical calculations that may be required at a practical level. It can give the confidence to one to actually build a robot. At the end of the book there is a very nice chapter on what things lie beyond the material covered in the book 
 Of the Carlotta mysteries I've read so far, this is easily the weakest effort.  I've often read aloud from some of the other novels in this series to my partner.  The language in this particular novel is somewhat awkward and doesn't roll of the tongue easily like some of the other novels.  The plot plods along and the supporting characters are dull and uninteresting.  I've never felt that the Carlotta's blues hobby was very realistic and it certainly can't hold a novel together. Even the appearance of Carlotta's ex-husband doesn't spice things up much.  Perhaps I have a bias against musicians (the ones I've known have generally been narcissistic and boring).  Syncronistically, just before this novel, I had just read the Sue Grafton novel in which Kinsey's musician ex-husband makes an appearance.  However, Sue Grafton makes it work and really uses his appearance to reveal something about Kinsey's character.  In Steel Guitar, the ex is just someone else for Carlotta to boink.  I've only managed to plod through about three quarters of the novel.  I just don't really care very much how it turns out 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I don't know about this Lil Jon.  His taste of beats and sounds are laughable.  How does someone with no talent make it into the music industry?  I guess its not hard.  I've listened to a few songs on this cd and couldn't bear to hear anymore of his ranting and raving about absolutely nothing.  He doesn't even rap!  An hour of yelling?  I mean, come on!  All he does is yell about the same subject, over and over.  He and other rappers, dare I mention from the south, need to reaserch the roots of true hip-hop and come up with something a whole lot better.  And to all who may think I'm just a hater, I just like good music.  Its not my fault I don't like senseless crap 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 I bought this book hoping to find new and exciting meals and snacks for children. Unfortunately i was very disappointed as most of the recipes are what i call "common sense" and things that i already do make for the my children.  I did however enjoy reading what the kids in the book had to say about the recipes 
 I love books, any genre, most authors, but I'm sorry to say that this book was quite a challenge.  It seemed to have promise in the beginning, but that's where it ended.  I didn't care about any of the characters, including Rachel, the so-called heroine of the story.  She goes to work for a shop that specializes in vintage clothing and happens to be there when some quilts arrive abandoned on the porch.  This could have been written to be creepy, mysterious, lots of different directions, but it went nowhere.  The author tried to weave a romance into the story, but that fell flat too.  What I really found annoying was the fact that Rachel was acting strangely on Christmas day, they caught her putting glass shards in the cranberries, and immediately the old grumpy guy knew it was the supernatural at work.  Now how was he so lucky to guess it right away?  I'd have called the cops and had her hauled away for attempted murder.  Anyway, I forced myself to finish this as a test of endurance and I did it!  No, the ending was no better than the beginning or middle.  Sorry, Barbara Michaels, I usually can find something positive to say about a book, but not this one 
 Let me start off, by saying that I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially of his work in the 80's and 90's when he really blew up. So, when you read this review, don't think that I'm an ignorant hater. Because I am not. I just give you my thoughts about this book. Here goes:  Y'all know what the book is about so I am not going to repeat it all over again. Jimmy Tock and the 5 horrible days that he will meet throughout his life.  I thought the book was awful and most of all- ridiculous. And I will tell you why. There was no credibility in the characters whatsoever. Usually DK does a great job in creating credible characters. Well, he totally blew it this time. Why? Because ALL of the characters are acting like idiot. There is NO WAY that Jimmy, his wife Lorrie, and his familly can act with so much humour in every single situation. Every single time Jimmy and his wife face a horrible situation, their worst enemies and when they are close to dying, it seems like they've got something funny and sophisticated to say. I mean, come on! That's just stupid! You're one step away from getting killed and all you can do is tell jokes and act like an idiot? That was totally annoying! All throughout the book, jokes and jokes in the worst situation. I know it's just a book of fiction, but the characters still need to be believable. Well, in this book, they ARE NOT.   The plot itself isn't so bad, but it's not good either. Especially the last few chapters, where everything is getting clearer - well the end doesn't make a lot of sense either, and it's like Koontz made an end for little kids or teenagers who haven't read a lot of books and don't know what a good book is. The end, when they meet their worst enemy is almost like the end of a soap opera - an ending that doesn't really make sense (and of course you get a lot of those stupid supposed-to-be-sophisticated jokes from the annoying Tock familly).  So, I am sorry for ripping this book appart, but to me it was a piece of trash. I just had to read it till the end, because I was on a vacation in Thailand and I couldn't find a good book at that time. Plus I wanted to see how low DK could go. It seemed (at least on that book) that he was tired of writing long books with a lot of developements and he just rushed this book with its ridiculous characters. 2 stars and that's generous of me. A waste of time. Get DK's books from the 80's and 90's instead 
 I would have to disagree with the pronouncements the book has to make.  I feel very strongly that the Bible does say much about homosexuality, in the concept of sin.  Thus I myself take a literalistic point of view of the Bible.  I believe the Bible is exactly as it says it is, the word of God, the message of God, to a fallen race--us.  The author, on the other hand,  takes a postmodern, very liberal view toward what the Bible speaks of and what the Bible preaches.  By maintaining a postmodern ideology toward the Bible, the author...as many other post modernists...have stripped away the Bible for what it truly means as God's message to the world.  In this case, the author has stripped away the truth toward homosexuality as viewed of by the Bible.  What do I mean?  Let me explain.    The Bible speaks of sin--those deeds that first manifest upon the soul, then formulates in the mind/body, and then done physically.  Within our souls is a cancer, a cancer that is born from our sinfulness in a sinful world.  It is because of this seed of sin that Christ came into the world through virgin mother as the prophets foretold, died on the cross as the prophets foretold, and rose again on the third day as the prophets foretold.  Sin is then "thought of" in the mind and body.  It is the whisper to do evil in our brains, the easier choice in comparison to the right choice, the lust, the desire, to want that burns in our minds and our hearts.  Then, when it is done, it is done through physical manifestation.  In this case, homosexual acts and actions.  Thus homosexuality is an act born of spiritual sinfulness and acted upon out of physical sinfulness.  However, and this is an important realization that is to be known from the Bible, homosexuality is just one of many sins that tempt and bring us to fall.  This, again, is a difference of opinion between myself and the author of this book.  I do not think that homosexuality is any worse than say gambling, or any better than say abortion.  All sins bring forth a wall between us and God, all sins must be forgiven by the blood of Christ so that we will be cleansed.  For you see, all sins are the same before the eyes of God, because they mare our souls and flesh, however, each sins has their own consequence.  And this is an important understanding toward the homosexual issue.  Homosexuality is just one of many sins and all sins are the same before the eyes of a Holy God, but its consequences are different than say adultery or stealing.  But know well that you and I are sinners too.  Our sinfulness might be different than the homosexuals, but we are still sinners that need the grace of God.  Our sinfulness, too, will have different consequences than the homosexuals, but still we are called to love the sinner (just as God loves us) but hate the sin.  This means that homosexuals should not be treated badly.  This means that homosexuals should be given our friendship.  This means that homosexuals can be loved through the love of friendship and through the love that neighbors are to have as the Bible speaks of.  What do I mean?  Well we are all sinners, and we all need Christ's grace.  If you are a homosexual, why should I judge you because of that homosexuality (as long as deeds such as pedophilea aren't done or other illegal actions).  I have known many a gay in my life and time, but I do not judge them, just as I do not judge those women I know who have had abortions.  Yes I strongly take a Biblical POV, and they know this, but I do not and will not treat any less because that would be a wicked deed.  You can agree to disagree about an action done, in this case homosexuality, without having malice or hatred toward the one who is washed in that sin.  You can give friendship to the homosexual while still maintaining a Biblical belief...the only thing that is called to you is that if he or she wishes to know your belief, you act with fearlessness in speaking the Gospel, the truth.  
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 I just can't stand this guy. At least these books keep him away from his unreadable fiction or helping David Lynch foist more garbage on the silver screen 
 There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling 
 This book, is not for newcomers to statistics. It often assumes a well versed backround in probability and statistics (and I suppose a decent background in calculus). There is often little explanation for examples and theorems. Often the exercises and examples require the solution to previous exercises. This is extremely frustrating and often discouraging. Many times I would find myself being refered to an example in a previous or future chapter whose solution refers to a problem that needs to worked out. I have an undergraduate degree in math and am by no means a genius, but compared to many well written math texts, the clarity and conciseness leaves much to be desired. The exercises do not go from easier to more difficult but from difficult to difficult. Often the concept that is trying to be illustrated could be done in a much simpler problem.  That all said, the book is fairly well written given the aforementioned weaknesses. My professors seem to like it as do a couple of PhD students 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working.  Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller, you must use the remote control.  When you take the dongle out with a DVD in, a screen will come up telling to reinsert, so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction, then you've just wasted thirty bucks.  I feel quite ripped off.  With the low cost of DVDs nowadays, it's a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO, you can get a good progressive scan for about $30 or $40, which comes out to about the same price.  As a side, it is also EXTREMELY annoying that you can't turn on, or off the device with the remote, you must go up to box to do it yourself, especially annoying if you just want to watch a DVD in your bed and crash afterwards.    All in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives 
 I bought this book based on the reviews that I read here and was very disappointed with it.  Coconut oil may be a good idea but the sketchy research in this book didn't convince me.  The recipes sound good but have many fancy, hard-to-find ingredients and are just too time-consuming to be practical.  I have only used one recipe from the book, as I found all the others to be impractical. Take the Thai Chicken Soup for example:  It has 16 different ingredients, 10 of which have to be chopped, sliced or bruised and many of which would be difficult to find and/or expensive such as lemongrass, galanga root, Thai fish sauce and Kaffir lime leaves.  Most regular grocery stores wouldn't even carry all those items.    The Phase I of the diet is a 21-Day Weight Loss Kickoff which consists of three meals per day and two snacks.  Some examples of the snacks are:   herbal tea and 6 macadamia nuts (no joke, thats all you get for that mid-morning snack) 12 raw or toasted almonds  1 celery stalk stuffed with goat cheese 3-4 sardines packed in mustard sauce  6 pecan halves  3 radishes and 4 green olives These are all individual snacks, not combined! If you normally eat like a bird, this might work for you but if you normally have a real snack, 6 macadamia nuts with sparkling water.  Phase II is a section on cleansing: first colon cleansing, then liver cleansing, gallbladder cleansing and finally kidney cleansing.  You may as well forget this phase if you don't have a juicer and all day to devote to the schedule.  For example for liver cleansing you would start your day like this: 7:00 or upon rising, drink 1 cup hot water with the juice of 1/4 lemon and a dash of cayenne pepper.  7:15 Beet juice cocktail (juice cucumber, carrots, a beet with greens, celery, ginger root and lemon).  8:00  any breakfast suggestion from the breakfast recipes and include raw food  take 1-2 capsules of the herb milk thistle or liver cleansing herbs  9:00 1-2 teaspoons Beet Salad (recipe on page 226)  10:30 ginger or echinacea tea  11:00 1-2 teaspons Beet Salad.  Sound like a lot of work?  And you are only up to 11:00!  It continues until 8:30 p.m.  Phase III is Introducing Healthy Carbs where you get to add a few more carbohydrates.  The meals are still a lot of work and the snacks are still tiny (you can have 6-10 macadamia nuts!)  Phase IV is Maintaining Your Healthy Weight.  More of the same but who could stick with it that long anyway?  Unless you love to spend the whole day in the kitchen and have a lot of time and money and have nothing better to do, you won't like this program.  Coconut oil may be worth a try but this book really isn't.  I like to eat healthy but this plan is rediculous 
 somehow i can't avoid making comparisons to the last franz ferdinand and brian wilson albums. it's weird what industry gets hyped regardless of whether it's old burnt-out dinosaurs or young fresh ones. i like this enough to hope the earlier works are better, as people seem to suggest. there are some moments here...especially towards the second half that do start to creep in but not nearly enough to suggest permanent "genius" status. my favorite songs were two nations (the least personal track)  and never went to church (the most-personal track). for the most part this (like most of today's rap) makes me simply miss the old likes of x-clan, poor righteous teachers....public enemy...and even good old eminem. mcc 
  the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time, an number or not the same ,an it,s not the same battery. do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling 
 I bought this book for my wife upon the birth of our child. We travel often and were hoping for some actual information that would help us TRAVEL with our baby, we already knew what to pack when visiting our neighbor. We were bored out of our minds listening to stories about the author's 'little junior'- don't waist your money on this one! We are still looking for a book with REAL information concerning the technicalities of traveling with our baby 
 Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.  The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.  The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.  In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.  Read his books. Avoid this movie. 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 With the possible exception of The Possession of Joel Delaney, easily MacLaine's most bizarre film. Here she's cast as a Hollywood slapstick queen who's so desperate to be taken as a serious actress that she secretly flies to the Orient and, unbeknownst to her film director husband (Yves Montand), poses as a geisha to land the lead in his movie production of Madame Butterfly.   Any resemblence to a remarkably similar I Love Lucy special of three years earlier (wherein Lucy and Ethel posed as geishas to fool their husbands while on vacation in Japan) is practically italicized. MacLaine's character has red hair, like Lucy Ball---and her character is even named "Lucy Dell." Need more convincing? Bob Cummings figures prominently in both the TV sitcom *and* this movie!  What might have proved amusing as the punchline to an outlandish '50's sitcom (husband doesn't immediately recognize wife under geisha drag, but when he does, turns tables on her--ha ha!) is weak tea stretched out to feature-length and played relatively straight. And despite being billed as a comedy (laughs are few and far between, even when intended), this is actually more of a soap opera, with MacLaine constantly fending off Cummings' advances while using her disguise to test her husband's fidelity. The jarring movie-within-a-movie climax (a sobbing MacLaine commits hari kari with a samurai sword--a buzz kill seen twice!) hardly adds to the fun; meanwhile, a dour Montand wanders through the proceeedings looking like he's just had a bout with a plate of bad sushi. Beautiful location cinematography just points up the artificiality of the rest of theproduction.   Ironically, just a year later, MacLaine would be much better served by the same trite disguised-lover plot (with Jack Lemmon as the masqueradee) in Billy Wilder's infinitely more entertaining Irma La Douce. 
 While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading  journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class. 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This popped up as a book that Amazon thought I'd be interested in.  I've been fooled by those reccommendations before, so I got it at the local library first.  It was a big letdown.  As other reviewers have written, there were no concrete techniques; no take-away's from this book.  There was a paragraph or so on "disappearing", but it primarily served as a teaser for another Paladin Press Book on hiding your idenity.  There was nothing on the design, selection or provisioning of the survival retreat (since "that information was covered in other books").    I read it in a couple of hours; many pages are little more than full page, stock-image photos.  I could have read it in even less time had I decided to skip over the screed about black helicopters, Waco, etc.  The title has potential to be a good book, but this fails in the execution 
 As a songwriter I found this of very little help.  There are SOOO many more possibilities for rhyme in contemporary music that this book is really only good if you want to know the perfect rhymes for a word 
 I bought this on the recomendation of someone concerning a technical question I had on Video signalling over SDI. It turned out to have about 1 paragraph on the subject, and didnt come close to being able to answer my question.  Having worked on Computers for around 20 years including writing and debugging mainframe assembler code, as well as many a day spent searching though page after page of hexadecimal, I am no stranger to bits and bites, and large libraries of thousands of technical reference manuals.  I have 3 problems with this book.  1) The title is deceiving. A more accurate title would be "Primer for decoder/encoder design" or "Video Signaling Reference Guide".  2) It cetainly does no "Demystifying". I expected a book that was structured and had a flow to it (as any educational book should) but found it to be written with absolutely NO PERSONALITY (like a reference book), and using terms at the start that then only actually get explained half way through the book!  3) There are so many tables and figures (overkill IMHO used too much to fill pages rather than explain anything well) with very little descriptions, and no keys to the diagrams. 90% of them also seem to be referred to by text many pages away from the actual graphics, which is just bad book design.  I am sure that the author really knows his stuff, and the book is full of very useful refrence information for designers, but for someone looking for an educational book on Video, you should look elsewhere, unless you have a fulltime engineer to sit with you as you read the book.  I can only recomend this as a reference book for those who already have a very good grounding in this field, or to be used in conjuction with another higher level book written by someone with much better educational skills.  
 While traveling in China I hooked up this charger to a Sharper Image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking.  A much better buy would be the Sony charger with worldwide voltage and for 5 dollars less 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 While this book provides a decent cursory review of East Europe, it is not to be taken as an authority on the subject.  Many times, Roskin will oversimplify political agendas and use imprecise vocabulary to describe his subjects.  For a comprehensive look at the political factors of the area, I would suggest something more along the lines of Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy 
 I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and her walking tapes and have several for variety and love them all.  I recently bought this book based on the reviews of others but found it really was geared to those who are new to walking.  There is one small chapter for advanced walkers but it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know if you currently do Leslie's tapes.   If you are just starting out walking, you may find this book contains some good information and inspirational stories.  But if you are already a "Walker", your money is better spent on a new Leslie Sansone DVD to make sure you have variety in your workouts and a subscription to Weight Watchers magazine, which will provide you with more insight into healthier eating habits.    I returned my book.  Sorry Leslie 
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 The original British series The Office: Like watching a clever, intelligent, and hilarious comedian (Robin Williams, for instance) perform a monologue that is so side-splittingly funny and satisfying, you'll wish you could replay it forever in your head.  Watching the profoundly un-funny and tasteless U.S. version of The Office: Like listening to a zit-faced teenager who thinks he's Robin Williams tell a fart joke. You'll wish to get the hell away from him after about two seconds.  What is it about The United States that we ruin everything? =(  This series is obnoxious, it's annoying, and I hope it dies a painful death.   
 I needed to buy this book for my graduate level class. I thought that everything that I read was information that I already knew. I guess that this book would benefit a beginner in MI but it was very dry and boring. 
 J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money 
 This book "guarantees" that you will see changes in your body - and in as little as two weeks.  Well, it sounds too good to be true and it is.  I followed this plan for months and it did nothing.  So where do I get my money back?    There are some good tips for healthier eating in this book, so if you get most of your meals from a fast-food place this might help you out, but it definitely doesn't produce the results it promises 
 I have never been drunk enough to listen to this all the way through, but I have made everybody hit the door, even when there was liquor left, by putting on "Muskrat Love."  Perfect for the thrifty college guy that wants to keep a few beers for tomorrow, or has already hooked up for the evening and wants the dorm room to himself 
 We were very disappointed in this CD. We are always looking for good CDs to play at the Italian events we plan. This is not one of them. The songs are so old without exciting instrumentation. More than half the songs on the CD are instrumentals that sound like they are from the 50s (Montavani-style). We shouldn't have had to pay as much as we did for these old versions. Sorry, can't recommend. 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 Employment Law for Business, 2nd Edition, is a text that covers legal topics such as; The Employer-employee Relationship, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Affirmative Action, Employment Discrimination, Sexual  Harassment, Job Performance and Behavior, Rights of Privacy, Protection of  Employee Safety, Income, Retirement, and Health.  This is a good tool for  managers 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 Given the scope and reputation of this book, it should have been an enthralling read.  However I found the first section on Antisemitism very unclear and unstructured. Whilst an impressive array of historical opinions, analysis and facts are presented, they are all tied together in a very jumbled and verbose way.  Midway through the second section on Imperialism, I surrendered and abandoned reading the book. 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 Like some others here, I was misled into thinking this was the actual textbook.  Instead, it's a pretty useless notebook with terms from the textbook defined on the left side.  Normally I would read the reviews and be alerted to this fact, but since I needed the textbook for a class I went ahead and ordered it without checking the reviews.  Amazon, you need to make it crystal clear that this is NOT a textbook!  You are either attempting to increase sales by misleading your customers, or you are getting very sloppy with your product descriptions.  Either way, I expect better from a reputable merchant like you 
 I should have paid more attention to the reviews...I was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn't be used as an everyday or long-term solution. We've been using the crate for LESS THAN three months and already the zipper one one end (that we use all the time) is screwed up and half the time it doesn't open. At least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out, but I'm afraid of the morning when I try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck. (We leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in. When she gets a little older, we will leave her in her crate all day.) We could still use the zippers on the top, but we don't like those since the dog can't get in and out at her leisure.   Although in general it's a nice crate, I probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers--hence the two stars. I am completely surprised that we only got three months' use out of it before the zippers bit the dust. We've already purchased a different, sturdier, latch-style crate that we're much happier with...and we should have bought to start with 
 This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on "Happiness" or "Spiritual Machines" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record 
 I had great hopes for this book, as I do for anything that continues the work of Jane Austen, but I was very disappointed. I did not find Ms. Tennant's Elizabeth at all like the original. She had no spirit! And Darcy was even more autocratic and uncommunicative than in the original. Moreso, the book did not continue based upon details given in the original in many particulars - Mrs. Collins discovers a first pregnancy that had already been revealed in the ending chapters of Pride & Prejudice, and Mr. Bennett is dead, when in the original, he delights in popping in unexpectedly at Pemberly. Better research and a better understanding of the original stories and character are required in my opinion. Not worth the read. The writing style, although consistent with the original, makes too much of reiterating certain phrases. Ms. Austen did not do this herself in her works. I have read many, many Pride & Prejudice continuances, and I found this one weak. I have enjoyed the Carrie Brebis books, and I liked the series of three (I'm sorry I can't recall the author) that viewed the story from Darcy's point of view. 
 what a ripoff. the "miniature version" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like "amazon shopping for dummies". i have absolutely no use for a 2"x2" book on anything 
 This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring 
 This doesn't even deserve 1 star.  This supposed "relaxation" gadget was a complete waste of time and money.  It had NO HEAT as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching.  (...) Instead of relaxing, it has increased my stress level 150%!!  (... 
 I hate to say that after listening to every track on this Album I was very quite disappointed. As you'll hear I should say, the band is not near to it's original quality as they were in albums such as speaking in tounges at which point some of their most classic memorable hits were introduced to the world. The music selection was bad, poor writing, and it seemed really out of time so Sadly I regret to say if you like the all time sound of the Talking Heads don't buy this album. You will be quite disappointed and look at it like this: David Byrne left the group less than a year after it's release so the unpleasing change couldn't have been for the better! It was unfortunately this album Naked that dropped the curtains on a fairly cool band popular in my high school year 
 This was an interestng diversion but hardly the masterpiece that I was led to expect. Pretty ordinary 
 I like the style since it's different from the typical shoe rack, but shoes are always falling off this thing. It doesn't fit boots or many types of dress shoes, and it's hard to squeeze men's size shoes onto the different tiers without knocking shoes off a different tier 
 THIS WAS THE MMOST BORING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY.IT IS CONFUSING AND DID I MENTION BORRING.   P.S. MS.D PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFF MY GRADE SPELLING ERRORS  SIGN_  THE BOY WHO DIDN'T LIKE STORY TIM 
 This book really is controversial.  I would suggest more research and self education because some of the information provided is just not true!  It gives a neat perspective on things but not a book to use for diagnosis!  I would suggest supplemental reading if you are serious about your health.  I found a great report on Inner Health available at librarydepot.com  It includes a nutrition benefits chart that links nutritional support needed to many diseases/disorders 
 I bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers.  Let me be candid....what the hell were they reading?  This book is simply insipid, implausible and a waste of time.  Get this for a premise....rich, geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the "Connecticut Nutmegs"!  Nutmegs for a major league team??!!  Yeah, right.  It gets better....he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the C-list movies he produces....ok hold on to your seats, here comes the good part....she is going to be his star player on this MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL team!!  Why, because in college she was an excellent athlete.  So some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball!!  Am I the only one who thinks this is plain stupid.  Oh, yeah there's a murder along the way.  Parker (author) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise I can't think of a reason why it got published.              
 Even though I never listened to Ray J's music I always thought he could sing.  When I heard "One Wish" on the radio I liked the song a lot because of the beat and overall sound to it.  When I found out it was Ray J, I was shocked because the vocals sounded kind of horrible.  Very recently he was on that show, "Showtime at the Apollo" and let me tell you it was embarassing.  This boy couldn't sing a lick.  It looked like he was in pain and his voice kept going out.  He was frontin like he was really doing something but you can tell he strains a lot when he sings and I bet the audience noticed it to.  This has got to be one the worst singers in music history.  He makes mediocre singers like Mario and Usher sound good.  I really don't know why he got a record deal with any company because his vocals are bad.  I guess because he's related to Brandy, who can actually sing.  When you have that instant name recognition it usually gets you in the door rather you have talent or not.  Even though I don't own this CD I just had to write a review because his singing is so bad it's hilarious.  His songs sound nice, but it would be a plus if he can actually sing.  So why would anybody waste money on this.  I don't care if the music is nice.  When a bad voice accompanies it, it can be quite annoying and unbearable.   
  Conason organizes chapters so each "revenges" (hallucinatory liberals' embellishment!) allegedly smearing accusations conservatives fling towards liberals. Displeasingly, this plan's appreciable from strict, coherence stndpoints. Conason's tone isn't as infernal in his monstrously devious cunning as his demeaningly liberal peers, who're ALL hazardously untamed in Bush-antagonism. Shyster Conason's still unforgivable in his slanderous pollutedness of scornfully branding rightists, when he defrauded in his unholy Introduction that his tripe WOULDN'T be narrow-mindedly adverse, like his ostracized peers'!!!! In Ch.7, dissuasively, his furious, up-to-then secretive partiality rears its UGLY head and savages ANY remediableness his "work" has of being reasonable.  Although Ch.8-10 are vilest, treachery in Conason's disrespectable "arguments" materializes. Conason stoops to untrustworthiness in his Introduction, when he incompetently forges that liberals are majority by misusing poll results regarding universal healthcare!!!! Conason vindictively neglects mentioning those biased "polls" occur ONLY during adverse economies, like polls last fall showed because of the economy's unprogressive downturn-which HAS rebounded.  Ch.1's depraved argument's flimsy. Conason dictates indiscriminately ALL CEOs are conservative prostitutes whose tax interests are subserved by the WH. Besides underhandedly admitting the conservative derogation of liberal disenfranchisement in business management, Conason's tarnish is fallaciously based. Assuming the WH crafts tax policy in CEOs' interests, this isn't necessarily alarming, as Conason combatively terrorizes. Refunds and write-offs for corporations are factually good, since this helps income. With expanding earnings, corporations will GLARINGLY hire to complement growth, employing Americans!!!! Provided you're liberal, you'll wrongfully find this blasphemous, which WILL reflect on you as undereducated.  Conason homicidally exaggerates choice facts, relentlessly prejudiced to liberal stubbornness. In Ch.2, he mishandles questionable "evidence" falsifying the LIBERAL MEDIA's conservative slant. Conason selectively seizes one unverifiable source, Editor & Publisher, to sinisterly further agendas of assumingly claiming conservative slant in media. What Conason hides is that survey involved opinions of editors/publishers regarding who they'd think would win 2000's election. Since most-indiscriminatingly-believed Bush, they were inclined to proclaim him since they realized the Gore-alternative was bleak. Conason fabricates upon embellishing that editors voted for Bush. A NARROW margin voted Bush. Conason conceals that survey asked said editors/publishers if they felt there was biased coverage. 80% of 25% who responded affirmative professed there was GORE BIAS. In another mistreated "source", Gannett newspapers, Conason bestially deceives their papers shifted towards right-wing endorsement despite their relative liberality. Before 2000's election, 13 papers turned Republican, so OF COURSE Bush's endorsements incremented, with the resulting discrimination of 41-votes-for-Gore to 37-votes-for-Bush still being worse Demoncratic prejudice.  Ch.3's idea's unlawful. Conason's the malcontent gall to mutiny against verifiable mantras of conservatives denigrating liberals traitorous!!!! All one's to do is bloodcurdlingly inspect Demoncrats' reactions to terrorism. They've bitched about "civil liberties" sacked by Ashcroft, Iraq's cost, keeping troops there necessarily, giving grants to Iraq, and American intervention to neutralize Iraqi terrorist and nuclear threats-even AFTER voting FOR war!!!! Not to mention Clinton's imposition of the "Torricelli `Principle'". Conason's amoralities descend further when he brutalizes conservatives for libeling Clinton the "draft dodger" he was. Conason encroachingly errs that Clinton's dastardly choice to evade Vietnam was acceptable due to his "disbelief" to war, while liberals tarnish Bush for his reasons of joining the National Guard, which at least was SERVICE!!!! Conason mendaciously involves secondary tactics of relying on filthily circumstantial examples when he plots to implicate conservatives as cowardly for avoiding Vietnam because of medical reasons. Conason abysmally covers-up HOWIERD Dean's ski-trip orgy after getting deferment from Vietnam!!!!  Ch.4 uses subterfuge in oppressively aggrandizing Clinton's "quite impressive" economical record, citing 4% unemployment, 22,000,000 "jobs" "created", and rising income. Conason mustn't fiercely scold Bush: Bush's 2003 tax-relief-the benefactor of 8% year-end GDP and 20-year high consumer confidence-is PRECISELY THE reason defamers like Conason shouldn't prematurely manufacture slurring in September, because he's dishonored now!!!! Clinton oversaw 350,000 INITIAL CLAIMS in January 20, 2001 (leftovers from Clinton's policies), and his "bullish" economy was shattered by calamitous ruination in markets, and high interest rates by 2000's end. Out of those 22,000,000 "created" "jobs", 92% were private-sector, forebodingly in unstable tech start-ups which contributed mostly to the markets' collapses. Because of the recession's length, interest rates under Bush culminated in 2002's record year for home sales-the strongest economic part which curbed the recession.  From Ch.7-10, inconsistencies become falsification!!!! In Ch.7, Conason preys on discriminatory, isolated incidents in Republicans' demeanors to fake "proof" of conservatives' immoralities. In Ch.8, Conason arraigns Bush's family as misconducting "Crony Capitalism", despite it applying to BACKWATERS whose dictators distribute favoring deals to friends. Bush's appointments are properly classified as nepotism. In Ch.9, Conason partially seizes thin connections of Bush to a "fundamentalist"-conservative professor, because Bush introduced his book, to frailly convict Bush of failing "compassionate conservatism". Ch.10's incontestably THE most ludicrous of Conason's uncleanliness. He bleakly invents Clinton was proactive against terrorism!!!! BWAHAHAHA!!! 
 When I first saw the film, I liked it.  I didn't love it or anything, but I found it vaguely enjoyable.  Then I found out there were books!  So I read the books...  And now I hate the movie.  What is the big idea here?  I like Anne Hathaway, but she completely failed to portray Mia the way she should have.  Mia in the books hates being a princess, did not really want to be dressed up and pretty, and is obsessed with Greenpeace and saving animals.  She is opinionated, funny, and a bit nerdy, with her head way up in the sky.  She is not a girly-girl, she is not glamourous, and she is not a great beauty.  As for the other characters?  Mia's friend/bodyguard Lars in the books is changed to the bodyguard Joe, who is in love with Mia's grandmother.  I'm sorry, but no.    And speaking of Mia's grandmother, what is up with Clarisse Renaldo here?  In the books, she was a cranky witch who always yells at Mia and puts her down or tries to manipulate her, and she always drinks and smokes while her balding poodle cowers in the corner.  In the movies, she is nice.  The perfect royal grandmother.  I would not have picked Julie Andrews to play her, mostly because I can't see Julie Andrews tattooing eyeliner around her eyes and shaving her eyebrows to pencil new ones on.  Lilly wasn't terribly different that I can remember.  She was more fleshed out and detailed in the books, though.  But Mia never mentions her crush on Michael until the end.  She liked Josh Richter for about two weeks.  She had a crush on Michael from the first grade.  Also, Disney is gearing this towards the wrong audience.  The books were definitely PG-13, what with Mia's mother getting pregnant with her Algebra teacher's baby, Mia at one point catching her cousin Rene using a fax machine to photograph his "nether regions," and other things like that.  It was not meant to be a cutesy movie for eight-year-old girls who love pink.  The integrity of the books has been raped.  Go ahead and praise it if you want, but this movie is complete and total garbage.  I haven't even seen the second one, where Mia turns 21 and has to get married, although there is no such clause in the books, the whole movie isn't even based on a book, and in the books, Mia never passes age 15.  What are the fine folks at Disney doing to people?  All the new movies that have come out recently, with the exceptions of Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Carribean, have been terrible.  Just like this movie.  I would reccommend the books in the Princess Diaries series to anyone, but PLEASE do not watch this movie 
 I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists.  The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color.  The storyline, however, is amateurish.  Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable.  Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan?  And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother?  DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician?  The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics.  The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive.  Were his parents abusive?  Why the displaced agression towards Bruce?  The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama.  I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there.  I wished the writing lived up to the art work 
 These are a little mealy or grainy, but are OK.  Pretty high in carbs though 
 While her struggle is apparent her story is difficult to follow and when it is followed it is merely repition:  "I was held hostage in my own kingdom, I was strong, My subjects came to me with gifts... blah blah blah."  I do not reccomend this book except if you are an insomniac, it certainly can put one to slee 
 Right-wing media ratcheted up the long-standing conservative complaint that the media is dominated by liberal publications. Though many journalism experts deny that is the case, the image has settled in the American consciousness, forcing newspapers, magazines and television stations to go out of their way to prove they are not liberal. 'We have a conservative media and also a mainstream media, which is also now fairly conservative because it has been forced to deny being liberal.   The Gannon case is a prime illustration. If, during the Clinton administration, a fake reporter from a Democrat front organisation, using a false name, had been exposed as attending White House press conferences it would have been a national scandal. If he had then been shown to be a gay prostitute, the scandal could have threatened a Democrat presidency. With 'Gannon' and Bush there has been no such outcry. The mainstream media has approached the story warily, while right-wing organisations such as Fox News have largely ignored it.  nuff said!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book.  At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.    Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one 
 This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1. This political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped. Save your money and buy Ghostface's new album. This will be surely headed to my list of the year's worst albums. Big Big Big Big Thumbs down 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 I challenge you Mr. Will Wong to a duel. Ill slice you and dice you with my knife 
 What the hell happened to these guys, not that they had much to offer in the past but damn, this is the apitamy of falling off. This band sucks just more so then they ever did. When your a big name band in the past then you come to play the Charleston Municipal Auditorium, you have really hit rock bottom!!. You can bet I will not be attending, and i cant imagine many others attending either!  Give it up Godsmack your not with the times anymore, your horribl 
 Like practically every other company, Dell does an absolutely lousy job of telephone support.  Consider that 1000 times as many people have access to a telephone as have access to a browser.    Michael, a piece of advice.  Try calling your own 800 number and see how much you enjoy navigating the idiotic Dell menu prompts and incessant transfers.  Revolutionize that, and you have my praise.  Otherwise, your book is a formidable piece of history, not something significant for the future 
 If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.  Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.  Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.  It's better researched 
 Very disappointed - have worn sandal perhaps 10 times and the main strap has torn from the sole - until repaired, the sandals are unwearable. These sandals were not worn in rough terrain, they were not buckled too tightly, they were not abused.  I am unlikely to purchase any Betula product again 
 I bought this book on the same day as I purchased frontpage, in hopes of creating a relatively simple, but original website. No fancy graphics, but a nice design that I could hopefully het frontpage to code for me. What a dissapointment. For example, I attempted to put in a navigation bar. The book covers this decently, but only if you use the pre-made buttons, and doesn't cover how to alter the buttons to look how YOU want. No thanks. 
 Bly deserves credit for introducing Spanish poetry to the American audience back in the 1950s and 1960s. Machado is a wonderful poet. Unfortunately, Bly is not a terribly good translator, and the result is a  mismatch 
 I didn't really enjoy this book as much as the other Meg Cabot books I've read.  There were some parts in the book where I was like, "is THAT how you spell that," or "do what??" or "um, are you sure?" I'm not a professional writer, and I don't normally notice these kinds of things.  Take "bhang" for example.  I'm sure she's talking about a bong that you smoke from.  It's spelled b-o-n-g, not bhang.  Bhang is something you can drink, not the instrument used for smoking. For the record, I don't smoke, but every college student knows what a bong is. That is the only one that stuck out in my mind. I wish I'd bookmarked each and every one of them, because flipping though the pages I can't seem to locate any of the others, and quite frankly I'd rather not read the book again.  Don't waste your money.  If you have to read it, check it out from a library.  
 USB 2.0 is wonderful.  PCI Cards are very easy to install.  Unfortunately the card is odd shaped and does not fit well into all PCs 
 I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.  There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others. 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 My background is not in marketing so I was looking for a text that could help me. This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I have done plenty of research in pursuing both of my Master's degrees, so I have a pretty good nose for sniffing out BS. Let me outline some of the major issues I have with this book.  1. Longwinded and repetitive. Conrad should invest in "The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition by William Strunk." I recommend that book to anyone. It is a small book that is all about effective writing.  2. Through out the book Conrad recommends specific people to seek work from. There are names and phone numbers. Am I to believe that Conrad placed these people in the book out of the kindness of his heart? I wonder how much each one of those vendors paid to be in there.  3. In every other chapter, Conrad recommends one of his other books. It would have been nice if he would have consolidated all of this information into one book. He has about 9 books with "Guerilla Marketing" somewhere in the title.   For those who like hearing the same thing over and over again with a sprinkle of new information, this is the text for you. There is plenty of filler and the bulk of the information you could find on the internet.   If you've got little time to waste, don't pick up this book. The favorable reviewers of this book are either friends or vendors. 
 I read this book while doing research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL, the Complete Book on How to Curb your Cursing.  I give the editor credit for the compilation, but for what purpose?  Some of the expressions are clever,  some are funny, but most are not.  People who read this book looking for  new ways to express themselves should determine if they will come across as  amusing or just crass.  While I believe the basic word has some value,  promoting its use is a social disservice. The fact that the book has  received so many favorable reviews reflects the decline of civility and the  dumbing down of both our language and our concept of what is funny. My book  has an entire chapter on this word that is not only more amusing, but also  thought provoking 
 I have been a graphic designer for ten years. I am formally trained in this field and have a background in fine art.  I purchased this book because on the flyleaf it states that the author wanted to share ideas about some pitfalls to avoid in this business and to help others with his knowledge and expertise.  I have quite a few problems with this book. Firstly, it was typeset in this hard-to-read-but-looks-beautiful-in-layout sans serif font. Whose bright idea was that? This is a book about graphic design, supposedly sharing important ideas, and yet the designer who did the layout was more in love with form and pretty layouts than in making the book easy enough to read to actually impart the information it was pretending to care about.  There was also a lot of self-congratulatory interviewing with 'top designers' and some of the challenges they faced. While this may have been a great idea, the questions were worded in such a way that there are no real insights ABOUT THE BUSINESS to be gleaned from the answers. A fresh grad will most likely not be that concerned about staying fresh, and an experienced hand will probably find reading about other designer's process no more than a curiosity.  In other words, this book was written for noone but the author himself. Skip it 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful 
 I was excited to try out this product, given all the rave reviews. But after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash! It's awful! And I DO NOT have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination. I would not recommend this product. 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development. The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky. Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez. 
        I really wanted to like this book.  Unfortunately, the author's unbridled emphasis on medicating people with mental illness against their will was a constant theme. To my astonishment one character stated, "Once we got the right information, I must say that the system worked very well for us, up to a point: patients rights.  Patients' rights often clash with what's best for a mentally ill person."  I think every American (smokers, drinkers, eaters, authors) has the right to make bad decisions. To suggest that people with mental illnesses are somehow less entitled to the rights afforded to us by the constitution is abominable especially since the author uses an underground railroad sub-theme.  One more example of the author's insensitivity to people who are not like her is when she discusses how non-Latino doctors hire Latina receptionists so they can get more business from the receptionist's friends and family.  The stereotyped implication is obvious.            I found this book very stigmatizing of people with mental illness.  The "normal" characters were well-written and complex, but the characters suffering from mental illness were one-dimensional and underdeveloped and not representative of the majority of people with mental illness.  Anyone reading this book will walk away thinking that people with mental illnesses were all violent, dangerous and childish. This book does not do anything to destigmatize mental illness. Instead of addressing serious flaws within the current medical model of mental illness and the entire mental health system, the author engages in a blaming the victim mentality or in this character's case, her brain and its alleged imbalance. After all of these years of chemical imbalance talk, there is still no evidence of a chemical imbalance causing mental illness.     To suggest that the problem of mental illness can be solved with high doses of medications is limited at best.  It is also dangerous.  Although the author continuously touts the virtues of medications, she almost totally overlooks the problem of debilitating, and sometimes permanent side effects these medications can cause. The author alludes to these side effects in one paragraph.  The other 319 pages are like a free advertisement for big pharmaceutical companies.  Besides, a lot of those medications are only helpful to the people who interact with the mentally ill person and not the mentally ill person her/himself.  Use of certain antipsychotic medications mimics the effects of an actual physical lobotomy.  I guess the person would be easier to live with, but at what cost??      I did appreciate the author's attempt to portray the plight of families that have a member with a mental illness. However,her unfettered belief that drugging people against their will is a good solution to a complex and complicated illness was a big turnoff. I think that in 100 years the mass drugging of American adults and children will be viewed as another sad chapter in psychiatry's attempt to legitimize itself as a science. I think someone should drug this author and put her in a mental hospital for 72 hours. 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 I love Sandra Boynton books, and have purchased each and every one.  I pre-ordered this book a few months ago, and was very excited to receive it.  After reading it, I was very disappointed.  It lacks the spark, wit, and imagination of her previous works, and I doubt I'll even read it to my kids.  It contains a nice sentiment, but I could spend a couple of dollars on a greeting card and get the same message.  I'll think twice before pre-ordering another of her books 
 I used his book as an MBA student 15 or so years ago.  Now as an adjunct professor, I am using this newest edition in my undergraduate classes. Although my observation may be biased, the book is a bit too encyclopedic,  a bit superficial in coverage, and fails to excite the students.  I wish it  were more up-to-date 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and  daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it 
 Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!  
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 I got this for my fifth grade class.  It's better than the social studies textbook, but not fun.  I'll probably have to make worksheets to go with it.  Basically a kid reads a history report as a voice-over while the Peanuts kids occasionally do something 
 I feel like I completely wasted my money.  I read all that I can find on Arthur and Guinevere and have done extensive research on the Arthurian legends and tales.  I find the use of modern twentieth-century slang distracting, offensive, and extremely inappropriate.  The phrase that reached off the page and slapped me in the face occured when the Lady of the Lake makes the remark that "it works her last nerve." I literally cringed.  I wish I could get my money back!!! 
 I knew there were two aliens/UFO camps: those who believe we're being visited by aliens, and those who don't believe we are. I hadn't realised there was a third camp: those who believe these "aliens" are demons. For those willing to swallow the existence of demons in the first place, I guess this is great news for them.  For a rational treatment of the alien abduction phenomenon in modern society, read "Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens" by Susan A. Clancy, and of course Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World" 
 It's funny to see Robert C. Byrd writing a book like this. Byrd is a former Ku Klux Klan man (was a part of the KKK during World War II but did not serve his country) who continues to show his racism by a proven history of voting against all nominees who are African-American. He also voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. So I guess this proves him to be racist and sexist (as well as reckless and arrogant!). Byrd also is famous for putting his own state, West Virginia, ahead of his country. Although he is a senator and should look out for his state, he should not point fingers at leaders who are putting what is best for the country in front of all else. And he changes ideas on issues and then later apologizes for it. If you are going to write a book demanding Bush to pull the speck from his eye, then Byrd better prepared to pull the plank from his own eye because Byrd is in no position to give advice or point the finger 
 Warning to all parents purchasing this for a child. Both vol 1 and 2 contain nudity and may not be suitable for children. Guess that's the difference between a comic book and a graphic novel.. 
 I listened to Dr. Turnbull lecture in West Virginia when I was 19-21 years old in the early eighties in my hometown. At that time I found him an inspiration. He was able to communicate such respect for life, how different people live it and to provide an insight into the beauty of the peoples he had studied. When I saw this book I was delighted because, of course, I was hoping to feel that person I came to know somehow communicated in the text. In the end I was left feeling his life was brutal and disillusioning and a horror in many respects. I think the man I sat down and spoke to years ago, who gave such inspirational lectures, would never have left you this way.  This is not a love story , it's a sad defeated story about failed love and man's degradations. In this way I found the book an oddity.   I suppose Dr. Turnbull was accused of operation with rose colored specs, but in a sense a teacher deals with the human spirit and he was a very elevating person. One thing that stayed with me was his discussion of how without certain fundamental things like food and security people behaved without their "humanity". It helped me appreciate Maslow's heirarchy so much when I came to study that in ed classes and then use it's meaning in teaching. Dr. Faini brought him to our world in school , and his love of music and percussion and world instrumentation was so obviously connected to Dr. Turnbull. I prefer to leave my memories intact and read Turnbull himself, even if the author might contend he has exposed the reality. 
  I was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster. All 3 DVDs are not compatible with the European standards, and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside USA and Canada. I did of course not recognice this before I had given them away as a present to my parents, they had for such a long time wanted these movies. It was a sad moment when they put the first DVD in the DVD player. So they are of course all unwrapped because I was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers......I am so dissapointed.I had to pay toll on them as well when they came to Norway, so if I get 3 new ones send I will have to pay toll once more???? Then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me. So what can you do to make amends? I am rather angry about this. Rang 
 This is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play.  My sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken.  The company was nice enough to send a new one out but now (only a few weeks later) the plastic on the goal is shattered.  The goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored.  Overall, I would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play!! 
  Although one of the most amuzing & entertaining books I've ever read, it is blasphemous in every way. I read the entire series and by the third book it finally is in the realm of comedy.    Walsh seems to interpret the 10 Commandments as 10 "suggestions". The last chapter (so we won't forget it) of the Bible is: REV 22:18 I,John, solemnly warn everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will add to his punishment the plagues described in this book.   For those who doubt this evaulation of Conversations with God, please see the movie Devils Advocate. Maybe then you can see the truth.... BIBLE: (B)assic (I)nstructions (B)efore (L)eaving (E)arth    Not suggestions, not dated concepts, simply the truth of how to live a happy and fullfilled life.  
 Halfway through this book I had an incredible urge to hurl it at the wall.  But I paid for it, so I forced myself to finish it.  I was sorry that I forced myself.  It was depressing.  I don't understand how people can rave about this book.  A history and geography lesson of Istanbul would have been much more interesting.  Pamuk abandoned the usual formula of entertaining the reader, instead creating some sort of literary experiment.  I hated it.  Don't buy it 
 This book is badly dated.  Worse it shows configs for new to Linux administrators and leaves the harder configurations missing time after time. No SELinux just cron, SSH, password and file permissions utilities.  Fortunately I brought both the Linux Troubleshooting Bible and the Network Security Bible.  I recommend both for those starting Linux security administration.   (...) Center for Internet Security  Valdez Ladd CCNA, CIW-SP, CCSA, CWNA, I-NET 
 There is nothing I could add here that wasn't already said by the other 1 star reviewers that preceeded me. Just a couple of generic trends: 1. Lots of books get published (and unfortunately read) based on the author's name. Although Moss Cnater has never belonged to the senior guru league (in my opinion and I have read her revious works - tedious and uninspiring), Harvard Business school still carries some weight, although one has to wonder why, based on many distinctly ordinary, even bad books they publish through their Press. And if you read Harvard Business Review, you should have realised by now how mediocre and way overpriced that publication is.  2. One reviewer wonders how could she, a professor at already mentioned uni write so badly. People erroneously associate things together. Just because somebody teaches at a university does not make them good writers; heck, it doesn't even make them good teachers. How many truly great teachers do you remember from your uni days?

 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 If you think that a newly-married couple with virtually no experience dealing with family-planning issues is the best source for advice on family planning, you just might be willing to take a risk with this book.  It's chock-full of abstract theorizing and starry-eyed notions about the "blessing" of pregnancy -- it's virtually bereft of factual realities, like the unreliability and burden of following "natural" family planning (if you call daily mucuous-membrane measurements and temperature-taking 'natural'), and the dread of finding out that, once again, you're pregnant but can barely make ends meet to support the children you already have.    In other words, it's one thing to talk about how great it is to 'trust God' when you only have one child -- it's quite another to try to pretend that failure to use reliable birth control is so wonderful when it results in 5 kids under the age of 8.  I've seen far too many couples wax poetic about natural family planning when they first get married -- only to hear them say "What were we thinking?" five years later when they realize the consequences that come from taking such a passive role in their own family planning.    Upshot:  you can take an active or passive role in planning your family.  If you take the passive route, make sure you understand exactly what that means -- and talk to those who have a more experienced perspective than just a couple of years.   
 ignorance and propaganda run amok...a good movie for a lot of american dumb guys who like war movies just because they're war movies...the nazi's made films like this in the 1930's with the poles portrayed just like the vietnamese are in this film...the vietnamese boy in this movie is named ham chunk???  are you kidding me???  the sad part is no...they're not kidding...which makes this movie all the more revolting...but i see it's quite popular...which is informative as to how george w. bush got into the white house and why american soldiers are now bogged down in iraq...the same war mongering fat heads who didn't "get it" (understand the consequences of putting your big american nose in other people's business) then, don't get it now.  Winston Churchill warned, "those who do not remember their past are damned to repeat it"...a fine vintage vietnam war movie for simple minded viewers...remember freedom is not free...freedom to make millions of dollars from selling weapons and war materials to the government costs citizens billions of dollars...this movie stinks...unless your sophisticated taste enjoys war as entertainment.. 
 And Suddenly, there was a flash..   and so starts at least 4 battle scenes.  We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan.  Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.    The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.    The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old. That is not to insult any 14 year olds, just a comparison to the language that you would expect from a young teenager of today.  Overall, extremely poor written book and boring cartoonish action. 
 After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless.  The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do.  I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing 
 I am a huge Bill Bryson fan, and read everything he writes, but was sorely disappointed in this book.  It was actually BORING!  I can't believe I'm actually saying that about a Bill Bryson work, but it is true.  I can't imagine why the other readers liked it.  If you haven't read his other work, like In a Sunburned Country (which was "wet your pants" funny) or A Walk in the Woods, read those.  Or anything else he's written.  Much better than this one 
 I must admit that I have never [ and will never ] read this book. I only write this review so those who read it will know that Robert Groden is an unscrupulous person who continually lies [ I have evidence ] and misstates the truth in his writings.  My roommate visited Dallas a few months ago [ and the sixth floor museum ] and upon his return he was eager to share with me a periodical named 'JFK: The Case For Conspiracy' [ written by Groden; 46pgs/ New Frontier Publishing 2003 ]. He, knowing that I believed Oswald acted alone, quickly turned to page 40 and showed me a photogragh of what appeared to be smoke billowing above the grassy knoll. I calmed him down and tried to explain to him that it would be awfully ignorant of them conspirators to use that kind of gunpowder, when "smokeless" gunpowder was invented in the 1870's!! We didn't talk much more about it [ he is aware that I know this case ], but I decided to read the thing anyways. Not surprising, 46 pages of nonsense.  To give you a small sampling of the lies that this guys writes, here are a few paragraghs from the section devoted to the murder of Officer J. D. Tippit [ pg 14/ only one page devoted to this important aspect of the case!!! ]. Pay attention to the third paragragh, it's hilarious......  .............About forty minutes after the assassination, Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit was shot to death in what may have been an unrelated incident several miles from the assassination scene in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.  The official investigators all came to the unsupported conclusion that Oswald had shot Officer Tippit. There is absolutely no evidence linking the two crimes, and none of the witnesses who actually witnessed the Tippit killing, indentified Lee Oswald [ a vicious canard ] as the murderer.  The physical evidence also tends to clear Oswald as the Tippit killer. Shortly after 1:00pm Oswald arrived at his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley in Oak Cliff. Departing the house " a few minutes after 1:00", Probably about 1:04 to 1:05 according to his landlady Earlene Roberts, he waited at the bus stop on the corner heading north. Tippit was shot nine tenths of a mile south of the rooming house at about 1:10 to 1:11 pm [ more like 1:15, but I won't harp on that ]. This would only allow five to seven minutes [ well, which is it: 5, 6, or 7 minutes? ] for Lee to arrive at the scene of the shooting nearly a mile away. It would take an Olympic class runner, or a co-conspirator driving him, for Oswald to get to Tenth Street and Patton Avenue in time......................  ???????? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH "PHYSICAL EVIDENCE"?? That entire third paragragh is derived from eyewitness testimony and has nothing to do with the "physical evidence" of the Tippit murder. Moreover, there are six pieces of physical evidence that tie Oswald to the crime scene, including: Oswald's 38 caliber pistol which was on his person at the time of his arrest; four spent 38 caliber hulls found at the scene which were matched to Oswald's pistol [ballistically ], to the exclusion of every other pistol in the world!!; and Oswald's jacket [ identified by Marina Oswald and fibers found on the inside of the jacket matched the brown and orange fibers of Oswalds shirt, EXCACTLY!! ], which was found two blocks from the crime scene in a gas station parking lot on Jefferson Blvd. Further, three eyewitnesses [ Helen Markham, Jack Tatum, and Domingo Bienvidas ] saw the shooting and positively indentified Lee Oswald as the shooter. Not to mention the six eyewitnesses that identified Lee Oswald fleeing the scene with a gun!! But Mr. Groden would have you believe that the Dallas Police were running around, coming to an "unsupported conclusion". And he is one of the "leading advocates" for conspiracy [that should tell you something ].   Groden is a fraud and a grifter, and he puts his kids through school because people are too hardheaded to look at the evidence, which is overwhelming. My advice is to stay away from anything this guy is selling.   
 This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book 
 I've been strugging for a long time to describe The Decemberists in  one phrase in a way that suited me, but an issue of NME a few months ago beat me to the punch - "Like the Arcade Fire if they were from the Renaissance and rubbish". "...Architect" is a good song, but the rest is, for lack of a better word, ass-water. Avoid this album. Hell, avoid this band. 
 I had heard good things about Chris, so I figured I'd check this out. But when I began listening to this one, I seriously thought there was something wrong with the CD. The first track sounded like a warped LP, or a cassette player in desperate need of cleaning. Unfortunately, the entire CD is that way. The playing is horrendous, and for the most part so is the singing, although he briefly shows flashes of potential vocally. The songs themselves blur into an indistinguishable mess 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 This short little book contains three essays that move from the exoterically esoteric to the downright incomprehensible.  Like Kabbalah itself is often assumed to be, Bloom's thinking is like a Gnostic nugget - albeit without the imaginative cosmology that Gnosticism historically had - where the first essay is like the outside of the pomegranate, the second essay like the layer around the pomegranate and the third essay the actual fruit.  Kabbalah and Criticism is set within a Scholem-esque historiography but with one thing missing: the Messiah which, in Bloom's work, never appears - indeed, one can wonder whether or not the Messiah is ever coming at all!  The actual fruit turns out to be empty and emptying; rather than taking us anywhere, Kabbalah and Criticism simply leaves the reader hanging.  The first essay is an explanation of the major themes in Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah, focusing primarily on its Zoharic (13th century) and Lurianic (15th & 16th century) manifestations.  Kabbalah is usually considered fairly esoteric; ironically, this essay is the most exoteric in the entire book.  It is clear that Bloom has digested the writings of Gershom Scholem - the brilliant mind who first brought Jewish mysticism into academic credibility in the 20th century - and it is from within this Scholem-esque framework that Bloom operates.  In the second essay, however, Kabbalah is clearly shown to not actually be a map of the world, but a type of two-dimensional signifier in which the various interactions between the the Ten Sefirot exist not as signifiers pointing to the reality of God, but as signifiers pointing to the fact that texts themselves interact with each other and that the interaction is not found first and foremost in the texts or the Sefirot, but in the space between them.  Thus Kabbalah, rather than speaking of God, becomes a springboard for a literary theory.  Why it is that Kabbalah ought to be this springboard is never explained; given the commodification of all things Kabbalistic today, it seems that Bloom is no different, for Kabbalah is entirely unnecessary for his theory - it's just a useful heuristic, and nothing more.  The heuristic, furthermore, never actually serves to take the reader to any point of understanding.  Thus, for Bloom, Kabbalah is a series of symbols that interact within one another ad infinitum but because they are never anything more than that, nothing ever arrives in Kabbalah any more than in any text.  In short, Bloom's theory is entirely devoid of a Messiah: just as the symbols symbolize unendingly in Bloom's Kabbalistic maze (something that Scholem would have found quite hard to accept), so too does the text itself continually exist in need of re-reading - or, as Bloom prefers, *mis-reading*.  Literature is a series of misreadings, a confusion of interpretation with text by insisting that all interpretation *is* the text that is being interpreted.  By the time Bloom gets to this essay, he is so far from the Jewish mysticism that he began with that it becomes quite clear that Kabbalah is really quite superfluous to his whole theory.  He *mis-reads* Kabbalah and, in doing so, is only capable of arguing that interpretation - mis-reading - justifies itself.  If one is interested in Harold Bloom, the back of this book claims that "Kabbalah and Criticism may justly be regarded as the cardinal work in Harold Bloom's enterprise."  I honestly can't understand why anyone would bother, though, for its Kabbalism is vacuous and its criticism vapid.  Bloom is a brilliant guy, but because his Kabbalism lacks the possibility of a Messiah - a reading in which the text and the reader meet in a moment of deep meaning - Kabbalah and Criticism simply wanders in a desert of thin symbols lifted out of their historical context and it therefore begins to look not just like the Messiah will never come, but that there is no historical world for him to even come to 
 I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it.  Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book.  Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his.  There is little additional value added here.  If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real 
 I bought this book with much enthusiasm after reading reviews since I wanted to study more about power animals and be able to share some information with others.  Well, there are no water animals except "whale", "dolphin" and "seal" so when we looked up fish, crab, octopus, and frog, we found nothing.  My power animal is the cockatoo - well, there was not even parrot to look up. Bottom line, there are only 36 animals with information.  For those of you who believe in totem animals and power animals, you know that for each person, there may be several animals to look up.  This book is not for those who are looking for a complete selection (obviously, within each species you find so many but it would be nice to at least list the main categories).    "Native beliefs explain that a totem animal is one that is with you for life, often an animal with whom you share a connection, either through interest in the animal or your resemblance to or shared characteristics of the animal in question. A power animal or spirit animal is a spirit in animal form that comes through with a specific lesson for you, and will change throughout the course of your life." 
 Don't get me wrong.  This is a great piece of work and a lot of effort has been put into it.  But there are some serious flaws in the points the author tries to very hard to make and the chronology of his examples in the film.  For example, at one point he refers to Neo throwing up immediately after he is extracted from the power plant in the first Matrix (a specific action he uses to support his point) when really this was several scenes later, after he was revived, perhaps weeks after his initial rescue.  So the point he makes about Neo "purging the illusory world of the Matrix" immediately after he is rescued, resolves as a bit of a stretch.  The book is riddled with these types of errors, as well as several misquotes of the films' characters, which if they were quoted correctly would falsify the claims the author tries to make.    While it is easy to see how Vedic literature undoubtedly plays a significant role in the events of Revolutions, the author applies Hindu philosophy to every section of EACH of the three films, which after awhile gets very monotonous, and seems like an extended paper from a C+ philosophy student than a Doctor.  The philosophy present throughout the Matrix Trilogy is clearly a mix of so many religious symbols and ideologies, it devalues them as a body of work to say that just one set religious ideals defined the entire philosophical undercurrent of the films, whether its Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Mysticism, etc.  However, while it is a predominantly narrow view of the religious influences of the Matrix Trilogy, it's an EXCELLENT introduction to Vedic Literature and The Upanishads, which I have delved into since, and find to be an INCREDIBLY interesting body of work.  So I'd say that the book was worth reading for that introduction alone.  Overall, if you are interested in an analysis of the Matrix Trilogy from a strict perspective of Hinduism, look no further.  If you are looking for a somewhat broader perspective, check out some of the other "Matrix and Philosophy" books that are avaiable.  There are a TON.  Also, I have to say that this book could use a second edition after it fixes its plethora of spelling and grammar mistakes.  They are hard to ignore 
 Unfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring!  What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame.  Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says,  "This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers." If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here.  
 If you're interested in this topic and want to read an entertaining yet expert presentation of it go directly to Thomas Kida's new book, "Don't Believe Everything You Think" instead.  Or, even better, Thomas Gilovich's "How What Know What Isn't So," or, for a more technical than popular account, Scott Plous' book on judgment and decision-making.  Fine's book is too talky, filled to the brim with tedious anecdotes, and lacking any reference to the real research that has gone into the results that she superficially presents.  Ironic that she glosses over evidence and proof that are necessary for clear and critical thinking while at the same time attempting to describe the phenomena that often cloud our thinking rationally!  Maybe this would be appropriate for 10-12 year-olds but certainly is far below the level of adults who'd like some real information on the subject 
 I purchased this book so that I might learn more about the linking process. I had hoped that I could write my own simple linker to help facilitate my understanding. Interestingly enough, this is exactly what the book advertises. Unfortunately this book only served as a mild introduction to several object file formats. Like mathematicians need formulas to understand certain processes, programmers need code to see what is actually is transpiring within the computer. This book does not contain anything technical enough that could actually be helpful in writing your own linker (providing you already understand object file formats). If this book was entitled "Introduction to Object Files" then I may have given it 5 stars. The book also has several references to writing a linker in PERL, but the website has not changed since it was published in October of 1999. No code has yet been posted and has left me with the feeling of being ripped off. The books website.... contains a draft version of the book. I'd suggest you simply read that and save your money. I don't think its fair to release half a product at full price. Being a student, money doesn't come by easily for me. I am certain I will never buy a book from Jonh R. Levine again 
 I'm in the military,  It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas.  It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems.  the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring.  I only had them for two weeks 
 Was excited about this after reading the reviews, but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag.  After buying it and trying it, I went out and bought a larger one.  Barely ever use this 
 While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.  I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have "struggled" in life.  Greenberg has had to "struggle" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.  For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.  I should receive a refund for slopping thru this "book."  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy "meterosexual" for writing this book.  
 First, let's begin with the premise that the collaberation of, at one time, in one relative place, and with (seemingly) one goal, those who have come to be collectively known as the Founding Fathers was, by any accounts, an extraordinary period in the history of humanity.  A Dream Team, if you will.  Second, let's remind ourselves that none of these men were devoid of their flaws.  Many, in retrospect, carried their warts and blemishes with a sense of pride, if not prominence.  While it is inevitable, and not inappropriate to find an interest in these founders and their various achievements so timely and exciting centuries after they did what they did, it is also inevitable that the lines of truth and accuracy have faded in the interim, and an honest interpretation of events between 1750 and 1820 requires of the interpretor an open mind, and a lack of preconceived notions.  Ms. Appleby has not satisfied that requirement in her Jefferson interpretation.  Appleby admits in the opening paragraphs to be an admirer, and continues to clarify that point throughout the book.  She sets Jefferson apart from the other 'founders,' who are minimized, if not dismissed as having provided less,if any substance to the drive for that ultimate goal.  Indeed, Appleby seems to be saying that the goals of the various gentlemen involved were so varied as to be in direct opposition to each other.  Moreover, Appleby outrightly idolizes Jefferson.  Her platitudes do not, however, shine any more light on the man, who certainly qualifies as one of the more secretive/introspective of the bunch.  Instead, one is left the option of accepting Jefferson as a Moses-like character, or of choosing to look elsewhere for a more in depth assessment of this certainly great man.  Other reviewers have noted her attention to Jefferson's issues with slavery, with women, with indians.  These are discussed, but rather than in a way that would try to find a root cause, or to compare them with other frailties in his character, the effort seems to be to offer them as some offset to the bulk of the material, which is close to hero worship.  There is enough information about Jefferson, even considering the depths of his persona, to identify some (but certainly not all) of the demons that tormented the man.  And also enough information to know that Jefferson was not immune to crossing the lines of decorum that separate the common man from the political climber.  But you wont find that discussion here.  In the end, we have yet another portrait of this man, who deserves his place in the pantheon, but ther is no flesh, no blood, no heart.  Just canvas 
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 Like most readers I am reserved, suspect and skeptical of books by famous authors that appear decades after their deaths:  these manuscripts which are mysteriously found between the mattresses or squirreled away in a trunk, in a country house where the author once spent a summer vacation. However, "Summer Crossing" is a book that Truman often spoke of.    My understanding is that this was to be his first novel.  *"More and more," he wrote, "Summer Crossing seemed to me thin, clever, unfelt.  Another language, a secret spititual geography, was burgeoning inside me, taking hold of my nightdream hours as well as my wakeful daydreams."  He set it aside and composed "Other Voices, Other Rooms."  After the subsequent publication of his story collection "A Tree of Night" and travel essays "Local Color," Truman returned to "Summer Crossing," only to set it aside once again to focus his attention on another short novel "The Grass Harp."    Judging from his own words Capote felt "Summer Crossing" to be unfinished and not at all representational of the standard he aspired to: *"I read it over two or three times, and one day I just decided: I don't really like it.  I think it's well written and it's got a lot of style, but I don't really like it.  And so I tore it up."  Yet, here it is in book form.    I'd love to be able to say Capote was too harsh a critic of his own work.  However, it turns out that his assessment was absolute in its accuracy.  "Summer Crossing" is a novel not without talent, but without distinction.  One fails to hear Capote's voice in this work.  It lacks all resonance, and is devoid of those qualities we most treasure in the accomplished and polished works of this author: passion, whimsy, a sense of foreboding and an overriding empathy for his characters.  Thus, "Summer Crossong" is a curio best read by those with a special interest in this authors work and history, those not likely to confuse it as a work which legitimately represents his talent.  [*From "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke pages 79 and 218 
 Or even more than 25% of it. I'm not kidding. You may have read in other reviews of the so called `monkey puzzle'. I laughed to myself when I read it and ordered the game anyway. I am a veteran gamer of over 20 years, surely with time and patience, I would be able to get through. I am also a graphic artist, so needless to say, accuracy shouldn't have been my problem. No. Wrong. What actually happens in the puzzle can only be labeled a glitch in the software. I progressed from mild frustration to wild rage over the day and a half I spent trying to solve this thing. Even when I broke my own rules and read the exact solution online, I could not get it done. Why? Because the actual game will not let me. That's right. Some sort of glitch prevents me from activating the right wheels so that no matter how fast or perfectly I operate them, I can't make the puzzle go past the point when the monster is in the pit. I use the exact combo to get the white monkey to come out and throw fruit on him. Nothing. He sure comes out AFTER the monster is free, though. He also comes out any other time, so I know I'm doing it right. He comes out except when I need him to to solve the puzzle. And yes, that is the only solution to it. There is no other way. So after getting all the patches and cheats and everything else, I've finally gone totally dishonest. I have downloaded a save game with absolutely no guilt whatsoever. I will see the rest of this game anyway. Ubisoft should offer a patch to remove that puzzle because it's defective and so hard as to border on absurdity. I just don't understand what happened here. Myst has never had twitch gaming in it. I play Mario or Donkey Kong for that stuff. And you know what? Those games were actually well programmed and WORK. I warn any Myst fan to stay as far away from this as they can unless they have a save file. Now I can see the lush landscapes and try to piece the rest of the story together. I'm just sorry that Ubisoft took away my chance to enjoy this game the right way.  I guess I can see why they have ended the franchise. After the other 4 games, this was such a come down. Myst was always known as a thinker's game, that encouraged taking time and savoring the various locations, the kind of thing that you could be immersed in without action game type puzzles. It's a little hard to enjoy the lush graphics when you are shaking with rage. At least if they wanted to change genres, couldn't they have done it right? Don't say you weren't warned. 
 I don't know why Amazon is still pushing the 3rd edition 4 months after the release of the 4th edition, which is much superior!  The 4th edition is available on Amazon as well, but you have to look elsewhere for the large print (Walmart online has it) 
 One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  To begin with, it butchers a classic book -- my kids were appalled when Frightful the falcon was killed.  But beyond that, everything about it is just awful -- screenplay, acting, direction, music, dream sequence(!)  Totally amateur, not one entertaining minute in the picture.  Negative five stars 
 Don't buy this book. Save your effort and money.This book won't help you to become a better writer. I bought the book because I was influenced by 5-stars reviews on this board, and, for my pity, I completely ignored opinions of those who was disappointed with this book ( Sorry!)Those who rate the book  5-stars, it seems to me that  them just didn't read really great books on writing: John Gardner " Becoming a Novelist" and " Art of Fiction"; "The elements of style" of Shrunk & White; Thomas S. Kane "Essential guide to writing".          
 It's hard not to like Doreen Virtue and all she talks about. She talks of many uplifting things. But then she downplays the role of Christ in the world. He is put at the status level of Ghandi and Buddha! Christians understand that this is a great falsehood.   So even though some good comes of following Doreen, her Source is not Christian angels and Christ. If you keep reading her stuff you'll be getting help from fairies, unicorns and angels instead of God himself. You decide if that's who you want to set your faith in.  As I said I like the woman and enjoyed her books I read, but after much soul searching I realized I was subtlely being brainwashed into putting my faith in the wrong things. So I must give the book one star because it's the only option available 
 I'm trying to figure out what the song is that plays at the end of Bourne Identity during the credits. I think it is a different song than what everyone else is asking about. Hope someone knows...Thanks.. 
 this book left much to be desired.  hoping for an interesting discussion on two captivating subjects, i was thoroughly confused and annoyed.  this book was very, very difficult to read.  in addition to the difficulty of  getting through this sludge, there were far to many grammatical mistakes.   tread lightl 
 If ever there were a case for not judging a book by its cover, this is it.   I purchased this book thinking that its title suggested an interesting  dilemma in the modern evolution of health care, but all I got out of it is  that John Lantos is someone who likes to see his stories in print.  The  more I read the book, the more I started to wonder why I was reading it.   If you value your free time as much as I do, don't waste your time reading  this book--you can get as much mental stimulation watching Springe 
 This product came w/o an assembly manual (except for dusting instructions). I would not normally consider that a problem except I can't figure out how to install coat holder arms? Can anyone help?  There do not appear to be any places on the central cylinder to put arms on. I did receive bolts and the arms themselves appear to have little indentations???   Any help appreciated.

 If you're building a computer based trading system, this title offers some interesting insight.  There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on.  But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places.  Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much.  Every time I read this book, I feel like my time would be better spent reviewing Conway & Behle's "Professional Stock Trading:  System Design and Automation", which covers much of the same material but with considerably more coherance 
 Since my husband died I've read every book on grief I could get my hands on .This was the worst .Too general and not enough down to earth advice .I would never recommend this book .Spend your money on "Widow to Widow  &quot 
 I wish there was a - rating system, I would rate this at - 10 stars, the only good thing about this movie is John Digweed (he shows up at the end of the movie for 2 minutes) and Bedrocks Heaven Scent.   It was such a burden having to watch this whole movie, first of all the acting is horrible and waaaaaaay overdone; Pretentious is the word. The acting was like watching those kids candy commercials were there's all these skateboarders and "extreme" sports figures doing tricks to advertise the candy product. Then theres all these gay love scenes, of which I found very unnecessary. If this movie shows what the rave scene really is, I feel sorry for ravers, fortunately this is not what raving is all about.   This story shows a corporate-underground (hmmm those two words shouldnt be together, should they? Well they do in this movie) rave, you have the party planner sending e-mails to all these yuppys to let them know where the party is, then theres the "going to the party" thing, the wharehouse blah blah blah. Trying to look like a real rave, but the last I knew raves werent sponsored by Levis or Starbucks!!   Then you have all these horrible actors trying to act like there all high on ecstasy, they just over do it, its like watching your granny trying to act like she's drunk.   Then theirs the dj's who act like their mixing by grabbing records, putting them on the turntable and cranking up the crossfader, any dj knows its not that simple. I'm not trying to disrespect the dj's, I bet John Digweed did a tiny part in this movie because the he probably got ditched by a club owner that didnt pay him for a gig and he needed the money to get back home.   Part of the movie is about this "raver-couple" who met each other like 2 days ago and are getting married, their "love" being completely influenced after using ecstasy (the love drug) and the dudes brother who is a complete pretentious nerd. The raver dude all the sudden is kissing another dude who is supposed to be the official rave massage guy!! I mean WTF?!!! Then his brother (pret. nerd) gets a hold on some E, of course he's never done any kind of narcotics or substance before, and he starts tripping and turns into a complete fool, he meets a chick who is supposed to be a veteran raver and she tries to guide him around his trip, then at the party he invites everyone for breakfest at his house, of course that doesnt happen because he didnt really like the people, he was just E happy.   Thank God theres and end to the movie, and at the end you get to see Digweed playing heaven scent, thats the only good part of the movie and it lasts like 2 minutes.   Oh I forgto to mention the "police bust". The police arrive at the party and the party organizer talks his way and gets a sngle cop to leave without checking any paper work or permit for the party, then later on the copps arrive and shut the party down in a raid like fashion, but guess what? No one gets arrested and the sound equipment doesnt get confiscated, the cops just run in the warehouse and run everybody out. Of course the nature of this movie wouldnt just let the people go home and stop filming this atrocity, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, the people go back to the warehouse, break the police lock and continue the party from where they left off. Totally unreal.   The raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing the massage guy and runs to the bathroom to cry, her boyfriend follows her and tells her that he's not gay, and of course they get back together and go back dancing, then when the partys done the raver-couple dude sees the massage guy and tells him "I'm not gay" and the massage dude replies "Nah, me neither".   I hope you got an idea of how bad the movie is by this review, I got a headache writing it. 
 The photos inside are very nice but it doesn't represent the standart of persian cat. Here in Brazil the Persian cat is very diferent. Persian's face (principally Persian's nose) is much more different than it is showing in this book 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 There's some useful information but it's extremely difficult to find through all the pointless little quizzes and stories about how awesome the author is at reading people 
 I'm so disappointed in this book. I don't get the feeling a that a lot of thought went into it. It really needed a better editor (if it had one at all). It's full grammar and spelling errors and awkward sentence structure, and reads like a poor translation.  Secondly, the book is only 172 pages long (large type on small pages) and doesn't really go into depth about anything. I read it in one sitting. The author never addresses issues like:  How do I find my first job? What can I expect when I get there?  How do I deal with a disruptive client during a group or semi-private class? When (and how) do I fire a client?  How do I deal with a difficult boss? What if the studio owner is paying me as an independent contractor but treating me like an employee? What is expected of an employee versus an independent contractor? How do I deal with my employer if they won't update worn out equipment, or keep scheduling semi-private lessons for students who should be in privates ONLY?  The author is more interested in discussing how to make your bedroom a more relaxing place to have sex. News flash! Candles are better that overhead lighting! Really, I could have learned that from Cosmo magazine. In fact I think I did, like 25 years ago.  I'm very disappointed because I really do need a survival guide! I hope someone with real research and writing talents will put together something more in-depth and helpful 
 I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!! I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response. DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS 
 I'm a long time BT fan, I know that some of the best bands in the world are ones that are able to reinvent themselves and sound nothing like they did 10 years ago and still sound great but this is not the case with BT and with this album. Simply put, this album is junk but I still hold on to the hope that they will improve with their next. If you're thinking about buying a BT album, get Travelers and Theives or Save his Soul, you will not be disappointed. This album is best forgotten. We will all miss you Bobby S 
 After reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Very close minded and not open to any changes. At the end you will be like whatever 
 This card was completely useless for me. I tried to install it in a Dell PC with a Pentium II running Me. Granted, it's an older setup, but Belkin says it will work. Not for me. The software/drivers wouldn't even load properly. I called Belkin, they said don't use the CD, download the new version from their website. Ooookay. Well, it installed, but it would not recognize the card or connect to the internet. My PC could never find the hardware either. Believe me, I tried every setting I could think of, un- and re-installed the software, everything. Zilch. The phone guy, though nice enough, was no help. So I scrapped it, went and bought the Linksys equivalent. It went right in, the drivers got it running and I get strong, reliable wireless internet while completely across the house from our router. Heed the words of myself and the others and don't buy this. Spend the extra couple dollars for a Linksys 
 If you're familiar with the writings of Wong Kiew Kit he often states that you can't learn genuine martial arts like Taijiquan and Shaolin Kung Fu from a book.  You need to learn from a master because there are too many subtleties that will be missed without a proper instructor.  So when Wong Kiew Kit states that:   "I have no Taijiquan lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Taijiquan masters. I mainly learned from Taijiquan classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Shaolin training."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans04b/jul04-1.html  Which is similar to saying:  "I have no Shaolin lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Shaolin masters. I mainly learned from Shaolin classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Taijiquan training."  There's no way Wong Kiew Kit would tolerate someone claiming to be a master of Shaolin Kung Fu without having learned from a teacher belonging to a lineage.  On his website he states that:  "Not a single person of those who have learnt Taijiquan from me complains about my lack of a Taijiquan lineage. In fact, no one seems to care about this lineage issue. On the other hand, they are satisfied that what they have leant(sic) from me is very close to the kind of Taijiquan practiced by masters in the past."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans02b/dec02-3.html  How are these people qualified to gauge how closely Wong Kiew Kit's Taiji compares to Taijiquan masters of the past?   Did they time travel and study under these past masters?  Or do they have a gut feeling like I have a gut feeling that I can learn Shaolin Kung Fu from a Taiji instructor?  It's quite likely that WKK is teaching a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu that uses Taiji principles gleaned from his interpretation of the classics.    I won't deny that Wong Kiew Kit is probably Shaolin master, but there's no evidence to suggest that he is teaching an authentic form of Taiji.  He has admitted that his entire knowledge of Taijiquan has mainly come from books and scriptures, not from a living breathing human being trained in a proper lineage.  Call it whatever you want to WKK, but don't mislead people into thinking its Taijiquan.  Telling people to learn from masters and not from books and then doing it yourself is completley hypocritical.    In the end, of what value is a "Tai Chi Chuan" book that was written by someone who has no real "Tai Chi Chuan" training?  In response to a new review, let me mention a few things:  One reviewer presupposes that Taiji branched off from Shaolin, but there's so much debate about the origins of Taiji its to hard to make any concrete statements about it.   The Wikipedia page on Zhang Sanfeng states that:   "Much of the written material about him is mythical, contradictory, or otherwise suspect. For instance, he is reported by different people to have been born either in 960, 1247, or in 1279."  There's almost no proof to suggest that he actually existed, or that he created Taiji out of Shaolin.  But what tends to be agreed upon is that all forms of Taiji branched off from Chen Style when Yang Lu-Chan learned the art and spread his version of Taiji (Yang Style) across China.     This reviewer and his master may have proper training in a Taiji, and I won't contest that, but as WKK explicitly states, he has none.  He seems to mistake WKK's lack of proper instruction from a Taiji master as modesty.  If  "modesty" is what you are looking for in a teacher, may I too be "modest" about my lack of proper instruction in Shaolin, and offer you my instruction; perhaps even a book about something that I have no proper instruction in.        WKK does state that you should not learn Taiji without a proper instructor, but he himself did just that.  Maybe he could provide us with the origins of his undistinguished lineage to settle the argument?    When the reviewer says that the Shaolin Temple is the "supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history," it really is just a matter of opinion.  Not everyone views the Shaolin Temple in such a holy light.  Everything WKK writes in his books about the history of martial arts, the Shaolin temple and Buddhism ends up supporting his qualifications as a teacher; which is a major conflict of interest.  All the legends about Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng are stated as fact without being prefaced with a warning about the highly mythical nature of their history.  He uses the iffy Taiji developing from Shaolin story to justify his lack of Taiji lineage.  If you were a prospective customer you would be highly discouraged by the whole no-lineage thing.  But when he feeds you the Taiji developing from Shaolin stuff the reader thinks, "If Taiji developed from Shaolin, WKK must be a Master of both."  WKK sounds pretty great if he is the one writing the history books 
 Being a day late and a dollar short, I finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews.  I could not get past the introduction by Lestat (Anne) saying how stupid we all are for "not getting" his/her previous book".  She/he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get, to my satisfaction anyway. AND the religious aspect of it all...... well I will keep my own council on that issue.   My theory regarding Anne's later efforts is (please do not take offence Ms. Rice) that Anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died.  Could it be that he had some part (a large one)in her previous novels?  The beautiful prose is gone from her writing and I think as her writing deteriorated, her ego grew.   All I can say is - Anne, stop writing, retire, open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity. Kick back, bake cookies enjoy your life, just please do not torture us with any more writing.   
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Until now, the only movie games I found that I could enjoy with a broad spectrum of people were the Scene It? movie DVD/board game and Reel Clues. Both of these games have their advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages of these games are largely overcome in Shout about Movies.  This game is fast-paced, diverse, and generally well-conceived. The variety of questions and the creativity in presentation make this game tons of fun.  I have played with large groups (7-10 people) whose movie knowledge ranges from movie buff to casual viewer, and although there were some who were frustrated because they didn't perform as well as other players, everyone had at least a couple questions where they were the first to shout out the answer to and, most importantly, everyone had fun.  Everything is handled by the DVD interface. I particularly like the way it keeps score. The first time we played, we assumed that we would have to remember how many points each team scored during the 10-question rapid-fire rounds. But to our pleasant surprise, after each round it complete the DVD does a question-by-question re-cap and asks which team answered it correctly. This actually enhanced enjoyment quite a bit since not only did we not have to count answers during the actually game play, it also gave the group a chance to relive the excitement that occurred when shouting out answers.  The game can only be used three times, which is disappointing (hence my durability score). But when we thought about it, for about $20 our group of seven had over two hours of excellent entertainment for the evening. In our case the choices on the table were  a) all go out for dinner (very interactive, at least $8/person, probably much more) b) all go to a movie (no interaction between group members, about $8/person) c) play Shout about Movies (very interactive, and about $3/person)  So it seems pricey, but when compared to these entertainment options it really isn't that bad. And it provided much more fun than any of the other options probably would have.   Obviously, there will always be a place for games that can be played many times, but I know that I will welcome Shout about Movies as a gift and will suggest it for future large-group gatherings 
 It's not a BAD book by any means, but I found it had very little practical information.  My mother-in-law keeps buying me twin books as I am expecting twins this spring, but none of them seem to offer any PRACTICAL information.  It's great to explore the psychological ramifications of separate classrooms and/or dressing them alike, but can someone PLEASE tell me EXACTLY how to get them on the same sleeping schedule?  What about disciplinary issues with twins vs. singletons as they get older?  Why do some twins end up hating one another and others are bonded for life?  (This book only interviews twins who seem to get along pretty well.)  Overall, I don't think this book offers any new information.  It basically tells you all sets of twins are unique and different and you have to find what works for your twins and your family.  DUH!  As I said... it's not a bad book and it offers some entertaining reading.  The "Twin Talk" sections are actually pretty interesting and cute, but overall, I'm pretty disappointed.  
 Bryant's book is a very comphensive introduction to holistic Christian development.  It tackles the difficult issue of how development can be distincitively Christian and tackles it well.  I was disappointed however in the lack of treatment of the place of the Christian community.  This is a good foundational book nevertheless 
 I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left.   BIG Dissapointment.  Don't waste your $$ 
 The fact that the author has been working for Microsoft and that he managed to get a foreword written by Jeffrey Richter do a good marketing job, but the book is disappointing.  No issue is treated in detail, and instead too many obvious remarks are provided (such as "Test the product fully before shipping..." or "No hardware is allowed to enter or leave the build lab without a team member's okay").  The only valuable idea is the so called Virtual Build Lab, which is nothing more than a separate codeline for a sub-project, which is merged to the real mainline only when it is stable enough. This idea comes naturally in big sized projects.  Berczuk book on Software Configuration Management is by far a much better choice.  
 Bagdikian manages to take an important subject -- deserving of sober and careful analysis -- and buries it in a shrill, overwrought and largely useless diatribe.  His general thesis, that the mass media are undergoing consolidation antithetical to consumer interests, is beyond serious debate.  Yet the book is so bereft of serious analysis and scholarship that the case is hardly to be made out.  For the wholly naive this book may, perhaps, open some new vistas.  But for anyone who regularly gets past the sports pages and comics there is little here of interest 
 Great paper.  Convenient to print large numbers of prints. But, it comes off the roll curved and no amount of effort can straighten it.  Wish it were not so 
 I made my first recipe from this book. Fresh Tuna and Zucchini Pasta Sauce.  It called for quick sauteeing the tuna in hot olive oil, removing the tuna and then adding 1/4 cup of wine.  When I did exactly that, the splattering all over the range, exhaust, floor was unbelievable.  Surely the author or Susan Friedland the editor should have known better than to recommend this procedure. I am now afraid to try anything else 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 Though I understand the authors misunderstanding, that is exactly what it was.  Christian Science has improved my life ten-fold and NEVER in my 29 years(I was born in the religion) was their any condemnation if a memeber  of the church went to a doctor, it was always a persons choice.  It was the  authors mother who made the decision she made it is not Christian Science  that does this it's the person, not the relegion.  Christian Science cannot  be blamed for someones misconception of it!  Never does the relegion teach  one not to mourn, but to try to see the spiritual truth in mourning and to  be able to go on living spirtually and truthfully.  At least this is what I  was taught in my family, who always have been very loving and STOUT  Christian Scientists.  My parents never told me I was never to go to a  doctor.  They taught me about prayer and God's healing power and to have  great respect in Mary Baker Eddy, but the choice always was mine!  Too many  people have misconceptions about Christian Science because they don't do a  THOUROUGH study of it, they only look at the Surface instead of Diving deep  within it MANY facts of TRUTH and SPIRITUALITY. People will state that Mary  Baker Eddy wrote this or that, but when I see this it sorrows me to realize  they obviously did not read Mary Baker Eddys works enough, one Reviewer  says Mary Baker Eddy mentions Happiness 90 times, well in  Science&Health alone she actually mentions it 132 times!  In all her  works and poems she mentions it over a THOUSAND!   So I actually was very  disappointed in this book that gives a very sorrowful and wrong  misconception of Christian Science.  I am sorry to say that the death of  her mother was not the fault of Christian Science but  her faith in it and  her misconceptions of it's teachings 
 I love Cheryl Wheeler but this is the first CD of hers I have not played over and over again. I suppose maybe if I did it would grow on me, but I have not as nothing really caught my attention, other than the title as I like the Sylvia Hotel. Nothing much to say about this one, I'm afraid 
 I was forced to listen to this band because everytime I got into a friend's car that loved this band had it blasting in his car.  I couldn't stand that ridiculous voice from the lead singer and the band's wacked sound.  Don't get me wrong here.  I'm not a hater, I love all type of music, from rock, rap, metal, new wave, pop, jazz, freesyle, opera, classical, country, R&B, blue grass, gospel, nu metal, industrial, techno, to the homeless guy on the boardwalk beating on pots and pans for a nickel.  I LOVE music.  But....WHAT THE HELL DO YOU FIND IN THIS BAND?????  THEY SUCKED!!!!  BAD....LY! 
 This book appears to be a description of how independently wealthy people live in New York, and, oh, there's a "mystery" or something going on. Predictable plot, inflatable characters, silly premises and a sudden but boring "twist" at the end -- this book is resoundingly mediocre and a chore to make it through. I recommend it only if you're having trouble getting wet logs to catch on fire but make sure you remove the plastic-coated jacket 
 Starting with the good, this book has a lot of research that I found interesting. It is one of my favorite ideas for a book and maybe Stilgoe will rewrite it and make it as awesome as it should have been.  Now for the not so good. Unfortunately I wouldn't have been able to read past the first chapter if this book wasn't recommended to me in the Practical Spying Handbook.  I admit I had high hopes.  I thought this book would be about what I enjoy most in life, wandering around.  And somehow it was and still incredibly disappointing.  I was able to read the whole thing, but haven't recommended it to a single friend because it is written in an insulting tone.  Maybe Stilgoe can blame the editor for not laying down the law, don't insult the reader, they are the only ones listening.     I was also annoyed how often the logic of "general people do general things, specific people do specific things" was violated. Stilgoe keep talking about the "explorer" or "bicyclist".  I assumed he was more often referring to himself.  The "explorer", a general term, did specific things like prefer to drink coke. I wouldn't have minded one bit if he just came out and said that is what he did, but that's not how it was written.  My recommendation for the rewrite of this book is to make it more like Folk Song U.S.A. by John and Alan Lomax, which tells great stories with a lot of historical facts.  Outside Lies Magic could really uses a little more adventure.  If Stilgoe decided to write another book and could combine the Lomax style with his research and ideas of our present world I would be interested.  But life is short and unless you read fast, I wouldn't recommend reading Outside Lie Magic.  
 I should have read the back cover more closely before buying Mirabai Starr's translation of the Interior Castle.  To her credit, she admits to her butchery of the text.  As cited by other reviewers, she provides a list of the words that she changed; Lord to Beloved, devil to "spirit of evil," sin with "missing the mark," etc.  However, all her semantics serve to do is to force the reverse translation by the reader, and it grew quickly tiresome to mentally exchange "Lord" for every instance of "Beloved."  Not to mention the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Starr had monkeyed with the text to a greater extent than she admits.  But, again, you have to admire Ms Starr's honesty in her statement that "[Teresa] would have approved of my boldness, if not the results."  This amounts to an admission by Ms Starr that her modifications substantially change the meaning of Teresa's text.  Despite all the linguistic hijinks, Starr's translation of the Interior Castle is not "Free of Dogma" as is its claim.  The concept of the soul is dogma.  The redemptive suffering of Christ is dogma.  Teresa's  patterns of prayer and life are rooted in dogma.  To attempt to pen a "dogma-free Interior Castle" is like attempting to write a "math-free Calculus".  What the attempt to "free Teresa from the cage of Christianity" reveals is a complete denial of Teresa's life and devotion.  Whatever pressures Teresa may have felt at the hands of the inquisitors and the Church heirarchy, Teresa was voluntarily a Carmelite and she deeply believed in all sorts of inconvenient things.  Teresa cannot be separated from Christianity - nor can she be separated from Catholicism.  In the end, far from being dogma-free and modernized, Starr's interpretation of Teresa's Interior Castle is simply castrated, lobotomized, sterile, and confused 
 This movie sucked do not waste your money.  Any discription you get of this movie is a lie.  
 Well I was very excited when I bought this book, I read 70% of it and it was boring, the book has too much information of too many subjects.    If you know basic things about internet and sales on-line, you might feel the same as I did. Bored.  They only give you "very" basic ideas, and offer to give you a better explanation later on and on.... which makes the book not practical.  Of all the 240 pages, the last 30 ones of the book were good 
 Ayelet Waldman is a graduate of Harvard Law School, so I assume she's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer. She should stick to what she knows. The fact that she's married to a famous author doesn't make her a writer. Her novel is poorly written, overly sentimental and, to put it bluntly, very dumb.  What's next? Padma Lakshmi writing a novel because she's married to Salman Rushdie?  
 This is not a comprehensive book on the field of Urban Design. Although this is obvious from the subtitle one is left with dissapointment. Aside from an interesting collection of cases studies you really don't get the complexity and timeless cross-section of this field that is having a renaissance now. None of the current trends are mentioned nor do they get any strong coverage (new urbanism/trasnurbanism/reurbanism/everyday urbanism/splintered urbanism/complexity urbanism) nor does the historical element comes through. Generaly good written book but too much of a sallad bowl without a proper structure and philosophy. Not a good tool for teaching. If you want top of the pops book in this field go to D.Grahame Shane's Recombinant Urbanism. For me it was astonishing how little space was given to new urbanism, the leading urban design theory and practice today 
 The illustrations in this book are breathtakingly beautiful.  That makes the reality of the text even more painful.  If you have any type of faith that there is a higher power, this is NOT the book to buy to help explain prayer to your kids.  It very subtly implies that there really is no one to whom we pray by overtly stating that there are no answers to prayers, but that we change ourselves when we pray.  If you subscribe to a New Age-y type thought, then this book will fit well with your beliefs.  However, if you have any theistic perspective, this may not go so far as to offend you but will certianly undermine your belief in such a gentle way, you might not notice.  I think the review in which the person said the book would work for a Pagan or Jew was telling.  How can a book affirm both belief sets?  It can't.  And this book does not 
 ive listened to this cd 4 times and still have not found a song. aimless noodling and horrible singing and horrible lyrics. once again its attitude over talent making these guys rich men over in England. figures then that Noel of oasis is a big fan. Avoid  
 I just purchased this product from a high-end, specialty gift shop for $6.00.  It was the exact same item 
 This was a very nice book, but I have to admit that it was not quite what I had hoped for.  I was looking for alot of information on Modern/Contemporary homes, more toward the 50's and 60's style, and from the look of the cover, I felt that was what was inside. Unfortunately, thats not the case at all, even the cover house was somewhat of a let-down inside. There is a little information on the square block metal homes of the 50's period, but most of the works are completely unliveable, done only for an original look (we are talking about 2 room homes shaped like cars)...if you are looking for an interesting conversation/coffee table book, this is nice, but not a necessity for the lover of modern homes 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY WOULD ANYONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND LIKE THIS LOUSY BAND.THEY ARE JUST A BOY BAND WITH GUITARS.THEIR MUSIC AND ALBUMS SUCK HORRIBLY. GET ANY ALBUM FROM LEGENDS LIKE PINK FLOYD AND LED ZEPPELIN INSTEAD 
 This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription 
 This book takes an excessive amount of time to maybe identify a dozen very fundamental, basic HR/Supervisory/Management concepts. It is one of many "feel good, have fun" books trying to distill complex issues to a unique theme to try to make up for its lack of substance. Nothing is new other than the story line, which is trite. There are over 26 books of similar nature on Amazon alone, that carry the same basic message and ideas. Recent feedback on the "best companies" to work for indicate that the common theme among them, regardless of extra "morale building" activities, is that of staff development and on-going training. Superficial approaches to morale lead to superficial morale. Its emphasis on external/extrinsic rewards to motivate and build a team ignores the lessons of the Hawthorne Affect and Maslow's seminal work and development of the concept of Hierarchy of needs and the self-actualizing person, as well as Frederick Herzberg's HBR management classic on how to motivate employees (you don't!). Indeed, try the approaches in this book on a self-actualizing person and prepare to be viewed as trite and superficial. Better to spend your time and money on HBR's "Best of HBR on Motivation" if you want to really understand how to "motivate" your employees or if you want some truly useful information 
 Great ideas in the book, but it didn't really engage me. I felt no connection to the characters or emotion. Nothing special. I thought I would be into it having a commercial photo degree, but I didn't.  I could imagine how lovely the photos taken by the photographer in the book could be, but nothing more.  That's really all I have to say about it. To gauge this better I am a fan of "Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold "Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls, and "Swimming" by Joanna Hershon just to name a few. 
 Glenn Hammond Curtiss appears to be a fascinating and underrated participant in the development of human flight. Unfortunately, I don't feel I know much more about him after reading "Unlocking The Sky" than I did before.  For whatever reason, Seth Shulman seems more interested in attacking the Wright Brothers (apparrently for what could be considered simply protecting their ideas and inventions) than in describing Curtiss's acccomplishments.  I've seen many errors and unfair comments pointed out in other reviews by folks with much more knowledge of aeronautics and flight history than I have. To this list I'll add (or point out again, if its already been covered) Shulman's constant mocking of the Wrights for some of their ideas that became "obsolete" some time later.  Should we also mock Alexander Graham Bell because we moved on to dial telephones, touch tone phones, cordless phones, and then cell phones? Or more to the point, should we mock Curtiss for his courageous and historic flight over New York because such a flight became routine in a relatively short time?  2 stars for what information one can gleam about Curtiss from this book.  No more because of the bizarre Wright bashing.  This being said, I recommend this book along with James Tobin's "To Conquer the Air" (instead of using the "instead of" option), for two differing views of the Wright Brothers 
 To be fair I didn't get more than 50 pages in, as I lost interest as the author focuses too much on off-the-bike situations for my taste.  That said - I know his work is super popular - so maybe it's just me 
 The only interesting points in this book have ALL been covered by other authors and with better prose and evidence. The original thoughts posed here about the Ark and Temple Electronics are so ridiculous that I felt someone was playing a joke on me.   In this day and age when we can pick up a cell phone and speak to an astronaut in orbit even though we do not have interstellar travel we are expected to believe that an orbital communication system built by beings who were capable of interstellar flight was radioactive?!? Please. If the author had tried to convince me that there were weapons involved in the Ark and the Temple then it may have made a little more sense.  I have to admit that I skimmed large portions of the book because it was boring me to tears. I wasted my money. 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I LOVE Mannheim Steamroller.  Before this CD, I could honestly say they had not made one CD I didn't like.  The only music I did like on the CD was from other CD's I already owned. I felt fortunate since, when I took it back to the store where I'd purchased it, I told them I had played it but just didn't like it and was hoping they would give me a discount on another. They let me exchange it out right.  Very disappointing.  NOT typical of Mannheim 
 This could be a useful source on several different levels, but there are some problems in the text that may confuse the average reader. The book is designed for readers to better understand the basics of the Balkan Crisis.  However, the reader must understand a good deal of history (a little more  than a college survey in Western history) in order to fully comprehend the  method the authors use to describe Bosnian History. Furthermore, the book  contains too many generalizations and not enough details. Evidence is  rarely given to support their conclusions or defend their position from  other theories. Definitions on some key pharses are lacking in the text  itself when the reader encounters it for the first time. A glossary is  provided but the information there should be mirrored, at least partially,  in the body of the text. I do hold that the authors are well studied and  educated, and that their conclusions *seem* correct. But I need some  documentation and evidence that should be contained in their arguements in  order to trust in their conclusions 
 but this one just seem half done. The characters were interesting and I wanted a better description. Somehow they weren't fleshed out. It was just not like Lee Smith's previous books.  But there were beautiful scenes, wonderful dialogue in places and I almost gasped at some things that seemed so familiar from my youth in the south.  It was however a disappointment 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 Really 0 (zero) stars but not an option. This game was awful on the DVD player but found that if you could keep it from freezing up on an X-Box, it moved a little quicker...until it froze.  What's wrong with it?  I don't think I read one good review and wished I had investigated before buying the second one after thinking maybe I just got a bad one the first time.  Why does everyone buy two? 
 It has been a long time since I have some across a book as bad as this one.  Not only is the author a kind of apologist for Bill Gates, blithely dismissing Microsoft critics as jealous of a superior being and accusing the FTC of ignorance, but the content is decidedly third rate.  First, as a dated piece of work, the author goes over a list of controversies that should interest no one anymore, such as the first  proposed information superhighway subscriber schemes.  He also goes on and on about Myrvold as a prescient genius nerd, though Gates fired soon after the book was published for incompetence.  Second, what the author attempts to cover about how MS works is unbelievably banal, such as hiring the smartest people (instead of those with experience and credentials) or the way that offices are configured.  As such, the book was of absolutely no use for question os how MS really does things.  Moreover, the edition I got was sloppily printed:  a page is missing, there are whole sections in which no periods appear and the like.  Finally, the style is boring and hard to follow.  Not recommended.  There are far better books on MS available 
 I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied 
 I bought this book with big aspirations of another "Joy of Cooking" with a little upscale to it. While I must say the design of the book is fabulous (I am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook's design), the recipes leave much to pine for. I don't like that most of the ingredients are nothing I normally keep in the house and I am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them. I have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and I have owned the book for over a year. I will stick to "Joy of Cooking" for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen. 
 well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.  they did let me get a refund which was nice.  i would use them again for that reason alone.  
 I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's. This one was disappointing as you don't feel like you did a workout. I like the older ones better with Tammy 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing 
 I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf 
 The premise for this book seems as though it could make an interesting story.  Unfortunately, this is not well developed. The story seems to touch lightly on dozens of things and doesn't have any depth or feeling to it 
 Guess what the biggest sin is according to C.S. Lewis in his  self-aggrandizing book, Mere Christianity?  No, silly, not murder, child molestation, starting wars, or rape. It's PRIDE.  Oh yes, and here is another chunk of wisdom for those who find deep meaning in blather: "Thinking about doing something is the same as doing it." (Don't let those thinking about hurting you find this out.)  Frankly, I'd rather someone think about molesting my kid than actually doing it. Plus, C.S. Lewis tells us that soldiers should kill for their country with a lightness of heart. Plus, we should love everyone the same--spouse, kids, god, mailmen, assassins, C.S. Lewis, Darwin, etc. C.S. Lewis offers nuggets of so-called truths without providing a smattering of evidence in support of his supernatural notions. You know, god, soul, virgin births, evil, hell, etc.--all the good stuff that keeps you blindly faithful while giving the logic cells in your brain a rest.  Are you tired of trying to convince yourself that your pastor speaks the truth? Let this book convince you the way no amount of evidence can.  If you prefer actual truth, try Carl Sagan's more contemporary work, The Demon Haunted World, or pull up the short essay by Richard Dawkins called Good and Bad Reasons for Believing.  Leave this book to the astrology crowd and those who think aliens visit earth to make goofy designs in cornfields; if truth is your passion, science is your source.It evolves.  If you like to believe stuff based on conjecture, testimony, anecdote, fear of reprisal, and because it just makes you feel good, check out the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, anything by Shirley McLaine; try dianetics, the Torah, assorted versions of the old and new testament; don't forget the book of Mormon, and Reverend Moon has some persuasive nuggets too.  I'm sure there are lots of prophets, gods, and gurus who would gladly tell you just exactly what it all means.  
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 I don't care how many credentials or degrees or how informative your information is, but if you start to fall asleep every three or four pages or have to read whole sections over because your mind drifts, then you've  missed an essential part of writing and editing. YOU MUST MAKE IT  INTERESTING! I read a half dozen books a month and this read like a text  book, no worse than a text book. It read like a military manual, JUST like  Kirkus reviews says. They were right on target.  Fire your editor and get  someone with a personality to help you write your next book. The only  reason I give it two stars is that the information is there if you can  suffer the writing 
 I grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping, as always, for a good read, but as well to learn a bit about a period of Chinese history that I have not read deeply in. Alas, Man's book fails on both levels.  Halfway through and the Mongols are conquering Asia. This part of the book is well written. Exactly why Genghis is the leader and why the Mongols are following him is left unclear. Indeed, after a rough childhood, being kidnapped and escaping Genghis emerges as head of the Mongols? Why? I do not know. The historical record here is probably sparse, but that is no excuse to skip over these years. They are pivotal to explaining why the Mongols emereged. Would the Mongols have emereged under another leader? Or, was it just Genghis?  The final third of the book is spent in Man's quest to find Genghis grave. The lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused. Then again, is Genghis's resurrection only to be seen in Man's hiking about the Mongolian woods?  Somewhere there is a good biography of Genghis and the Mongols, but this is certainly not it 
 This music is the lowest common denominator of the indie-pop scene just like Nickelback is the lowest common denominator of the modern rock scene. Stupid keyboard effects, boyish processed vocals that barely qualify as singing, limp-wristed monotonous guitar strumming like Coldplay, drum parts limited to 2 or 3 second loops, minor key quasi-melodies. If you're generally ambivalent to creative use of rhythm, harmony and melody and only hear the bohemian chic in the timbres this album will be a valueable fashion statement to add to your wardrobe. Recent stylistically similar albums with more musical substance incluce Postastatic's Be Still Please and Math And Physics Club's Self-titled. 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 I'm a graduate student at Stanford University and was required to purchase and read this book in conjunction with a sociology class I'm taking. I have to say that I am PROFOUNDLY upset that I was forced to purchase this book and add to this author's royalties. It was incredibly hard to read through his essays, much of which kept repeating the same Greek tragedies of war which the author so loves to cite. I found his language pompous, bombastic, and downright racist when it came to discussing and lumping the entire "Islamic world" into a tidy ball of hatred and anti-Westernism. His privileging of Western forms of war was baffling to me--a sort of strange thing to keep pounding on in light that wars in general can be tragic. As an American I am embarrassed that books like these can circulate and find a wide audience. I wasted my time reading this book and found myself enraged at the author's lack of reflection on more global issues regarding cultures and civilizations. His premise is that the West is superior in all ways, and there is no question that everyone else is just jealous. Again, I can't state how angry I am that I have contributed to this man's coffers, be it ever in so small a way! This book is not well-balanced enough to offer a view of 9-11 and the U.S. reactions to it. If you are of the view that the U.S. should just bomb the hell out of anyone who crosses its path--total anihilation and humiliation--then by all means, read this book. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and do some thinking of your own 
 ...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said "no they did not!"  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 I bought the software ( Digital Image Suite 2006 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.   A BIG MISTAKE.  I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2). UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same.  So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which camera made the image.  Here is complaint number two - If you use Microsoft's Customer Service/Technical Support you will be routed to India - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem.  After emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you can't write to their Washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address.  So, basically, Microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no American technical support.  Now, for the final complaint.  There is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program!  So, if I want to use a Microsoft software package to edit my photo images then I will have to buy a new software package - isn't that wonderful. 
 The idea for the book has great potential--and some of the children's letters are very cute--but the book itself is simply too thin to merit the rave reviews that others have given it. I was disappointed that the book had so little material and it would be hard for me to recommend it at the published price 
 usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for "legend")but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too"forced" for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(. 
 Being a fan of Ms. Englebreit's, I was disappointed with the projects and ideas in the book.  Her Companion book series are much better at inspiring one to be creative 
 While no one grammar is perfect, this one is fatally flawed by not having a Hebrew to English glossary.  Had I known this, I would have purchased the first edition instead, which does have one.  I also don't like having to use a separate Hebrew text (plus a dictionary) to do the exercises, which means you cannot use this grammar on the go.  The explanations are not clear, and Seow gives you too many vocabulary words and not enough easy excercises to reenforce them.    The pros are that you do read a lot of the Hebrew Bible and you are more prepared to move on to real reading, but even so, I think a much better choice is Weingreen's "A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew."  At the very least, though, get Seow's first edition because trying to use a grammar without a Hebrew to English glossary is a nightmare.  I don't know what Seow was thinking in leaving one out.  I really regret buying this book.  
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 I enjoyed the book up until page 111. There the author compared a person being late for an appoinment in Brazil as being somehow comparable to the murder of women in Arab cultures by members of their own family. How those  two situations are even faintly comparable is beyond me. If that woman who  is being murdered in the name of "protecting an important social  institution" were known by the author he might be able to disengage  from intellectual abstraction and acknowledge the inhumanity and horror the  murder of these women in the name of "honor" actually represents 
 I thought the main character was different and sympathetic, but that the author was too heavy handed in her other characterizations.  It really went quickly downhill in the climax, as the solution to the plot problem involves us suddenly believing that the super intelligent and powerful aliens are now as gullible as a bunch of 3rd graders 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 People who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci-fi/fantasy and a thought-provoking exploration of insanity, which interests me very much.  However, I found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone's "descent" into or recovery from madness.  The premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins, gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac/schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward, who turns out to be a professor at Cambridge.  Immediately, the reader is thrown into 50 pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through.  This put a bad taste in my mouth, possibly tainting the rest of the book for me.  The remainder really wasn't terribly interesting; I found Lessing's writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight.  Other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it; I guess that means I hated it.  So maybe I just didn't "get" it...personally, I don't think there was anything to "get".  
 Though evenly matched, the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image. Both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you are wearing them. About the quality you'd expect from Mervyn's or Sears on sale. Not terrible, but not great 
 The shuttle bay door will fall off in no time.  The booster rockets will be next.  The ability to stand it up on the launch pad will last a few days at best.  And the robot arm is cheap garbage.  This is my experience with a 4 year old boy, but it applies to all ages 
 The author writes about saffron the way I cook with saffron - sparingly.  The book was probably 70% autobiography and 30% saffron.  There were times where I would finish a chapter thinking, "Where was the saffron in that?"  I'll probably only ever read one book about saffron, and it was a mistake to have it be this one 
 As many other reviewers have stated, this is a huge let-down if you enjoyed the tart, sharply-observed film version of "Election", which made a star of Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick. The filmmakers clearly used this novel as merely a launchpad for their own, better story and vastly more sophisticated ideas and dialog.  The Tom Perotta novel is a short (very short) and weakly structured work, that meanders from character to character, often in short "soundbites". Clearly, Mr. Perotta has a sour, cynical view of high school, which he depicts as a place of constant sexual activity, not merely between students but between faculty and faculty, and faculty and student. This is not my own experience, and I am deeply disturbed if he has actually documented this in his own life. If male teachers prey on 15-year old girls like this, then it is a powerful argument that public schools should not allow males instructors to teach girls AT ALL under any circumstances.  Certainly, if I were a parent of such a young girl and was remotely aware that male teachers and PRINCIPALS were constantly leching at my daughter and her friends, making comments about their bodies and their sexuality, I would be moved to action. Fortunately, I think this is mostly Mr. Perotta's personal fantasy, and that only a small minority of sick individuals do this sort of thing -- but what does that say about him, and his own attractions?  Every character in "Election" is having some kind of dubious affair -- cheating on pregnant wives, cheating with best friend's spouses, teachers having sex with underage students, a young lesbian girl who has an affair with another girl whereupon that girl goes on to have an affair with the lesbian's brother, etc. Curiously the high school portrayed fictionally here is lacking in the kind of innocent, nerdy, dorky kids that I remember from high school -- everyone is an aggressive, sexually active exploiter of others. Every adult is cheating on their spouse, or leering at an underage teen. This is a horribly cynical, dreary view of life OR of high school, whether symbolic or not and it is entirely lacking in wit or humor.  There are so many comments from older men about teenage girls, that I seriously worry about Mr. Perotta's personal mindset. Is this his point? If so, then the book is seriously missing the clever political overview of the film, which wisely eliminates the adult affairs of the characters and much of the overall smarminess.  Often I turn to the original novel that a film is based on to gain clarity and more details about the story. This is one of the rare exceptions to the rule that "the book is always better than the film". In this case, the book is glaringly worse. The film's scriptwriter deserves a lot of kudos for making a sparkling and witty movie out of this dreck 
 I love to travel and thus peruse lots of books to explore and plan my future trips. I liked "1000 places to see before you die" as it did decent job in describing places worth visiting in all countries and continents. This book is a very weak copycat.   It seems that the criteria for choosing "natural wonders" was their proximity to US and south US in particularly and/or availability of the pictures. For instance, the book has tons of places in Texas, Arizona, etc. Not that these places are not nice, but the book completely ignores Moorea in Pacific, New Zealand has only marginal coverage and there are only couple of places in the whole India worth mentioning.   The book does have nice pictures, so it would qualify as a coffee table book for people who do not travel further than nearest McDonald yet like to dream or talk about faraway places.   But do not take it as a guide for places you must see before you die: you will miss much of the world then 
 I'm a fan of this show. I never missed an ep. This price, however, is so high it's offensive. What in the world are they thinking?  About the show: It had a lot of promise. They had good actors, an established 'universe' to play with, good special-effects budgets, a decent time-slot, and a crew that had been putting out quality shows for years. They did not, however, have a crack team of writers. Some were good, but on the whole, the writing was flat, the stories were predictable, the character arcs belabored and inconsistent, and -- the worst thing television writing can be -- boring. In short, they weren't good story-tellers.  It was very disheartening having to see such a talented ensemble of actors being given such asinine things to do. I understand that sex sells and showing skin is considered by some to be a legitimate plot device, but how many "suntan lotion" decon-chamber scenes can one series have before it's done to death?? If you're going to play the 'sexual tension' angle, at least be clever about it. I felt like the writers assumed we were all fifteen year old boys.  If the series had not been driven into the ground by poor writing and lack of focus, it could've been one of the best shows on television. (It would also still be on the air instead of being ignominiously canceled after four seasons.) Manny Coto finally came on board in the fourth season in a last-ditch effort to pull everything together and put out a good show, one that actually lived up to its promise. He managed to almost single-handedly lift it out of the mire. Unfortunately, just when things were improving, the network decided enough was enough and canned the show.   If you decide to purchase, I'd recommend buying the fourth season only. $480-something dollars is way, way too much for anything less than a classic series, and sadly, this series does not fall into that category 
 Somebody call Queens of the Stone Age and tell them that Death From Above stole their equipment ... and their licks. Is there room for another QOTSA? Probably. What I'm wondering is why this isn't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations. But then, this isn't quite the adolescent, swoon-inducing caterwaul of, say, sickly sweet dollboys Fall Out Boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs Hawthorne Heights. Death From Above, while not at all mind-expanding, truly is heavy and heavy is not light, and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl's wet dream. So, while it's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts, it doesn't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd. And who knows, I haven't seen what the band members look like; maybe they all have buckteeth, receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that's why they didn't get a TRL invite. 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 The method of BTDWB is good, but the book is VERY POOR!!! There is serious mistake in the method described. Dont forget to go to Corrections to "17 Simple Steps to Super Returns" for a further reading. (You can find it in Amazon website----Editorial Reviews) But the correction is still containing mistake.  Please note the Gold Price of the example in Corrections to "17 Simple Steps to Super Returns"! 
 I wish I had never owned the original recording of this album because THIS "version" is a sorry compilation disc distributed by BMG/Sony that hardly compares to the original. If you can find the original, get THAT, for this compilation disc does not contain some of the selections and suffers greatly for it 
 Like the reader from Walnut Creek says, this book is essentially a weight training book, and frankly, not a very interesting, thorough, or original one.  I was sorely disappointed.  There was really no information that hasn't already been published a hundred times before in a hundred other similar books and magazines.  Nothing cutting edge or inspiring or anything that makes you stop and think, wow, now that's a good idea, I can't wait to try that.  I've enjoyed some of Staley's writings in the magazines and on his website, but this was just a real let down 
 I, too, lost my father at an early age.  I was seeking a book to help as I struggled with his death many years later.   I rate this book a "2" because it didn't seem to provide the insight or informal counseling that i would have expected in a book, but rather was just a story with several examples of how other folks wrestled with the loss.  I couldn't finish the book and have moved on to other books as I wrestle with these issues 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 My 3 yr. old received this as a gift. It would not stay together so my husband had to "modify" it the best he could. It still kept falling apart so into the trash it finally went 
 Although the book has some interesting material, it in not a satisfactory book on Tantra. White has not approached the subject with sufficient humility, and he has gotten carried away by his ideological positions 
 I have never read such a neurotic, uptight, angst-filled book as this. The author actually inveighs against the eating of ice cream in public - an expression of his "not only Talmudic view" that "eating in the street is for dogs."   Really. I couldn't make this up.  His detailed review of table manners towards the end is quite interesting, but the book is marred by a long, metaphysical, and wholly irrelevant screed against the materialist, science-driven viewpoint that supposedly dominates our culture. Most authors in the humanities just launch into their subject without apology, but Kass' long justification of Why Science Is Insufficient distracts from, and fatally mars, what might otherwise be a very reasonable (if much shorter) review of the culture of food and eating.  Curiously, the preface contains a detailed explanation of why the author was not qualified to write this book. I'm inclined to believe him on this point. 
 I really expected to enjoy this - I love Dams' Dorothy Martin series.   I usually read the first two books before making up my mind about a series, but this was so bad that I didn't have the heart to read the next.   The best part of the book is the evocation of time and place: turn-of-the century Indiana from the perspective of a young Swedish immigrant working as a maid for the Studebakers. Hilda is one of the four Johansson children sent to America to find themselves a place and then earn passage for the rest of the family.   The overall story is rather flimsy. Hilda is deeply concerned that an immigrant, almost any immigrant, will be blamed when a member of a prominent family is murdered. When she learns that the police have left in a patrol wagon to question a Chinese guest of Notre Dame, a Mr. Kee, Hilda decides that she and only she can save him. She arrives at Notre Dame after an exhausting walk to learn what the lazy and less righteous of us would have guessed for ourselves: 1. The police have been and gone (they had a head start and they were riding in a wagon, for pete's sake!) and 2. The priests of Notre Dame could do more for the him than she could, i.e. provide an alibi. But in a very contrived sub-plot, Mr. Kee flees before the police arrive so that Hilda can save him later.   Her duties as a maid don't leave her much opportunity for investigation.  The servants' gossip network was supposed to be Hilda's advantage, but she finds the killer by dumb, as in stupid, luck, during an unnecessary piece of folly.     The killer's actions are a little hard to credit: I don't want to spoil the story, but means and opportunity are as important as motive. I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how the killer managed to pull off the crimes. Why would the killer be so stupid as to confront Hilda under disadvantageous circumstances? My guess is that Dams had some scenes in her head and then connected them as best she could with often awkward seques.   My last problem with the book is the Hilda's attitudes toward the US. The miserable experience of immigrants is a major theme in this book, and I don't doubt that a lot of immigrants had a hard lot, but why, having experienced hellish American life, are she and her siblings trying to bring the rest of the family here? Wouldn't you think they'd be saving to get back to Sweden? I don't expect a fairy-tale, but the portrayal of Hilda seems incomplete. 
 This book tries to teach you how to fix 170 different cameras in 150 pages. Is it possible? Let's cut off the intructions, safty advice, notes, index, table of connets and others, one camera only gets a half page's description at most. Do you think you can become an expert by getting this little help? When dealing with Canon AE-1, the author says: "Remove the front cover as usual." What usual? Where is the "usual"? So far I have not been able to open my camera yet, but it can be a good thing because I am sure I will not able to put it back 
 I've tried this tape on three different makes of VHS decks, and they all reject it.  Check your manual about cleaning before purchasing a cleaning tape 
 Let me summarize for you.  Who knows if prayer works?  Who knows why God answers some prayers and not others?  I ususally like Yancy but he really disappoints with this effort.  
 I expected something of a mystery with plot development. Wow, the plot never got higher than 6"s off the ground. The story was weak without any mystery and it had no development of charaters. The dialogue seemed to be at a 6th grade level because the story's character seemed to behave as 6th graders. If you read, Ludlum, Clancy, DeMille, Follet don't spend time opening this book. For those reviewers who thought this book had great insights into behind the scenes work of the government, you need to expand your reading list. The idea of the purple dots could have been a great story, but it never got off the launch pad. Most people have more excitement driving to work than what this story provided 
 The title and book cover tells you it's not a boring book.  The contents are not boring as well.  A bit of wisdom here and there worth carrying with you on your next chit chat on strategy but I had a hard time with the book's flow.  I find it poorly organized jumping here and there.  There are many authors which made it difficult to tie together but still, I think it could have been better 
 Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me 
 No...the answer to the question above, is that these guys are a metal version of a boy band, generated to sell records and appeal to the angry and mis-guided youth of America. They provide no great contribution or originality to music at all. A couple monkey like sounds from the singer with a sort of rappish vocals and repetitive guitars is all this band has to offer. Really, what is so great about these guys? Their anger and angst? Their musical abilities(HA HA). I have heard all of their albums and I hate them all, they have no talent and they pretty much rode on the NU-Metal wave, which has long since crashed against the sandy shores of real music and receded back into the depths where crappy music with no skill or talent belongs. Each song sounds the same, follows the same formula and style. All of the songs practically blend together. At least on their sophomore release they tried some to incorporate some different things into their music, and failed miserably. And their latest album? It is just as horrid and un-original as everything else they have made.. 
 If you're looking for a book on technique, which I was, RUN AWAY!  This book is about the philosophy of making pots.  I found the title misleading; I expected something more concrete (no pun intented).  This is a cerebral book; it has its place, and I may learn to love it, but not today.  Today I'm just disappointed 
 Aren't these the same guys who were quoted in AdWeek or Ad Age or somewhere like that blithely confessing that all the predictions made in their first book were wrong?  Maybe not, but I seem to recall.  So, they  said, just throw the first book out and buy their new book instead.  Come  on.  Visionary, smisionary.  More hypotheticals and made-up stuff.  If you  want to be provoked, Faith Popcorn is about as much of this kind of fluff  as you need 
 most of these songs were catchy at the time but haven't dated all that well.Rocket 2 u still sounds good.but they got caught up on the sappy side.the grooves were tight.when the Brothers of the group took over vocals  the songs sounded twice as better 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I went out of my way to find this book.  Boy, am I ever sorry.  Can I give this book zero stars?  This book contains all of the illumination of a 10 watt bulb.  Schneider's main environmental concern in this little text is global cooling!  Yikes!  Now he's an authority on global warming; so much for credibility.  Either Schnieder's an environmental schizophrenic or someone that lives at the public money trough.  The former hypothesis is the more paletable of the two possibilities.  This book is nothing more than the "nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind."  Don't waste your time.  The most positive environmental thing you can do is save a tree by using this book's pages as toilet paper 
 This book is a cure for insomnia.  If I ever have trouble falling to sleep, I'll just dig out my old "Flatland" book, and I'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later!  Listening to the A. Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing!  Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing.  I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying.  I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story.  Not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous 
 If this or any book sets someone on the path of enlightenment, I commend it.  Personally, though, this book was almost unreadable.  A play-it-safe tome of psychobabble, it is written on the level of People magazine.  No wonder there are people trying to unload their used copies for $0.01 
 This book didn't meet my expectations. 75% of the time, the author tried to tell us that the phenomena is true through some of his personal (non-scientific) experiences. I wish he would have rather explained the scientific reasoning behind it and left to us, the readers, to come to any conclusions. The only chapter I liked was the mathematics behind the crop circles. I am disappointed with the book 
 I ordered this movie on or around July 6, 2006 and have yet to receive it 
 My two year old really doesn't like this book.  I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute.  This one is just a grumpy book.  I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right 
 The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift

 I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 This priest admitted to child sexual abuse.  Please realize that he is a liar.  What he has written sounds so good, but you cannot trust the words he has written. It is so sad that he used his gift to lure children into his awful life 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 I was lent this book after finishing J.N.D. Kelly's 'Early Christian Doctrines.' Unfortunately, much of it is a disappointment. I was a little surprised to find how sloppy and broad-stroked Shelley's historical development of Christian history was, especially during the first five centuries: the development of papal doctrine, for instance, occurs much earlier than Shelley concedes in his book. Once the doctrine does develop, Shelley seems obliged to offer unsatisfying counterarguments to the reader - as if the reader were somehow unsettled by a historical development, and needed reassurance. This overall polemical attitude toward Roman Catholicism makes the book read much more like an editorial against it than a history of how it developed among other Christian churches. I would recommend trying a different book that aims to do more straight-forward history, and not historical promotion of one ideology over another. 
 I absolutely loved this book when I read it at 12 years old, at 21 years old and I wanted to read it again and have my own copy.  This edition was so full of typing errors that it was distracting.  I can't imagine reading this copy having never read the book before.  Even having read the story I had to puzzle out the meaning of some phrases or sentences 
 There once was a film called Andromina, A low-budget, no-talent drama the Critics called "stinking"-- What WAS Boeving thinking?-- A truly depressing phenomena.   
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing 
 The first thing I noticed about this book is how much it jumps around. Jude Fishers first two books were pretty good, but you couldnt really understand where she was going in the first one. Sure, this book clears it up (sort of) and you know where shes going with the plot. However, by now about 6 main characters are spread out across Elda and she constantly is jumping between each one. Also, she makes some of the characters extremely unintelligent, such as Erno. Erno Hampton was overly obsessed with Katla (another reckless, not so smart character) and he stupidly didn't even think about what he was doing when he tried to spend all of the mercenaries money at the slave market where Katla was being sold. He didnt even stop to think that they could do something else, and he could have blown his cover and gotten himself in deep trouble. It was very very frustating to read about these charecters stupid mistakes that i dont think anyone of his age would make. Even 15 year olds could make better decsicions in those situations. All in all, this book was a dissapointment to the previous two and I was upset that this happened 
 The Junie B. Jones series represents thoughtful storytelling replete with the sorts of syntactic and semantic errors that all thoughtful parents try to stamp out of their children's discourse conventions. For example, my multilingual daughter, a second grader in an international school in Japan, incessantly mixes Korean, Japanese and English grammars and meanings, not to mention reproducing the very colloquial forms of casual spoken English I'm always encouraging her to readjust in agreement with more standardized forms.  The typical difficulties that young native speakers of English have in moving, say, from the comparative to the superlative or in adjusting tense forms in regular and irregular verbs are codified throughout this series. Those who might object to this critique would also have to defend why errors such as those referenced here occur not only in the dialogues among the characters, but also in the expository portions of the stories. The author makes no effort to encourage her young readers to see the differences between colloquial forms and the more widely accepted standardized forms.  Thanks to Ms. Park's efforts, young children honing their language skills now have an opportunity to model the varieties that society generally deplores. Though her stories are delightfully cute, her methods do not further the kinds of knowledge that the larger society will come to expect from informed citizens. If her editor hasn't yet been dismissed, I would encourage Ms. Park to reflect a bit more on her approach to educational texts. 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 Well, I bought this book cause I'm learning jazz and they didn't have great tunes.  Even though it's over 600 tunes, it's still not that good.  I suggest getting another book.  Plus, like others said, the print is really tiny and it's annoying.  My friend, who plays bass, couldn't even read over my shoulder 
 This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors.  There is little flow or organisation to the material.  Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as  not of true value.  Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the  authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane 
 I was very excited when i bought this book since i am from the Caribbean.However i was disappointed with it. The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action. 
 The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.  The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling.  I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book. 
 After 6 months of use, the LED switch popped out of the coffeemaker's base, which turned the wired plug into an on/off device. I found that Black & Decker no longer services these products and the firm that does doesn't respond to e-mail 
 I didn't think this book was well-written and any different from another book called The Adonis Complex, which was much more interesting and focused. From what I understand, the authors of the Adonis Complex were the original doctors behind many of the studies Luciano discusses, including the GI Joe study. I suggest picking up The Adonis Complex if you want a better understanding of this problem in men 
 I like this story.The writer wrote people's mien very carefully. I make me feel seemingly I was in the story. It described a poor young woman and a man,they loved each other,they both bought a present to each other,and they  used different ways. The same thing was they both sold their things to by  the present. So, though they didn't have much money,their mental world was  rich 
 If he spent as much time giving real ideas as he did talking about all the money he made it may have been worth it. His add a contract when you lose on a trade, trading system is a recipe for disaster. Hardly definitive. I wish I could get a refund... 
 The book was kind of boring.  It wasn't very interesting reading about Hollywood back in the thirties.  Adults may get into it more, because they will be a little bit more familiar with the time period.  But for teenagers-not very interesting to read.  There are alot of names to remeber throughout the book, and you don't know how it really ends, because it is unfinished.  You may want to know if one of the characters will get rid of his boring liferstyle, but you never find out.  I have not read any other books by this author, but by reading this one first, I don't think I'll read any more of his books 
 This is pretty much a useless waste of an SD card.  The little programs on it are of not much use.  All of them can be downloaded as Freeware off the net.  I'm glad I only paid 95 cents for it, that's more that it's worth 
 Reading this book is a little like reading the Kama Sutra. Both books discuss fascinating subjects but readers are given far more information than they are ever likely to use in practice.  Some critical weaknesses. First, there is the number of metrics: there are 114 (and some metrics are divided into sub-metrics, too). Another problem is that while the authors describe a broad range of metrics and scales, they are often less than informative as to how measurement is to be accomplished. They maintain, for example, that brand awareness should be measured on a scale of 1-7; but they give little information on how this notoriously sensitive subject can be quantified accurately. The same is true of metrics such as customer intentions and loyalty.  Finally, does this book really solve the problem of how to measure marketing performance or payback? On the whole, it does not. Nor does it discuss the key decisions that managers must make about marketing, and this lack of decision-orientation is the biggest weakness of the book.  Managers need guidance that links with real world decisions.    Much better alternatives are: - Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949) - Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847 
 I would rate this piece of film trash a "0", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides "dawg" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity 
 My god who knew cooking could be so harmful and disaterous. I admittedly generally have my servents cook for me but I thought I might surprise my good friend Lord Wosley by making a Yak soup. Sadly there was no recipe for Yak so I settled on a carrot soup. My god it went wrong...Nine hours later my soup was actually weapons grade plutonium and my kitchen had to be completely refurbished. I have had to move into my summer house a month early. What a pain. Naturally, I am now in a class action lawsuit against Mary Lane Kamberg for repairs on my kitchen and mental anguish.If I have saved one person from buying this book I have kept the world safe another day. However if anyone knows an interested party in weapons grade plutonium, please let me know.  
 A quick glance through and I was very disappointed. There was no table of contents and virtually no intro/summarization/overview. It just plunged right into a particular encounter. This book has also been shredded a bit on various boards. I might buy it if an extensive errata came out soon.. 
 I am not a negative person, however I do have some negative feelings about this book.  I have what I consider "moderate" sales experience, selling everything from shoes, to real estate, which is my current profession.  If you are looking for a book that gives you practical, applicable advice, this is not it.  It is more of a feel good, hey heres a few ideas that may help you in general type book. Basically a lot of mush.  I found myself having to sell my own self on even finishing the end of the book.  I made it, but my eyelids were heavy and I was totally uninspired.  I am truthfully surprised that this book has recieved such positive reviews.  In summary, it was a book of broad, unconnected ideas that will have little to no effect on actual sales performance or customer satisfaction 
 this book is a huge disappointment. i expected more for my money . i am ready to redo my living room so i bought this book. i don't know the author, but the topic was what i was looking for. the book doesn't help me much. it's a scrapbook of living room photos & many of those don't look like the way people really live. and there isn't much real help in planning your own room 
 Simple...  Don't waste your time with this book. Hey, I'm a big fan of other Mick Mercer books, but having Mr. Mercer punch in "Goth" in a google search engine, then press print is complete rubbish 
 I first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the Mining Hall of Fame.  I actually know about this museum in Leadville Co.  The author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of "big business" to promote their agenda.  This museum actually took many years of interested individuals' efforts to create.   The author seems to be upset because the museum doesn't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact.  This museum was never intended to do that.  There are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this.  The Mining Hall of Fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the US.  Many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the US, but also the world.  The author is critical because the type of people HE would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented, and alludes to racism.  He uses an example of a Native American "discovering" uranium in the 1950's in New Mexico, and asking why this person is not in the Hall of Fame.  Gee, could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before?  After all, they did mine uranium in NM for the atomic bomb during the 1940's.  I did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book.... 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 Dunnavant just doesn't deliver with his enamoured account of Bryant.    I suggest "The Last Coach: A Life of Paul "Bear" Bryant" by Allen Barra 
 I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently 
 Mellow, sappy and annoying. Why would anyone want to buy this? 
 I knew the author as a younger man ...has morphed into an amalgam of Dr. Ruth and Dr. Phil.  Death of a close relative effects people in profound ways, yet personalities are mostly immutable. Ann Arbor is a granola city, but please. I found the prose stilted and the examples right in line with the general tendency of people in the helping professions to generalize their advice to the masses to sell books.  Waste of time!! 
 A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing.  Despite what the lead review suggests about "Its sharp photography" - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; "At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs" is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen 
         I thought that this was an okay book.  It's definitely not one of my favorites, and I wouldn't really recommend it.  There are some things I liked about it and some things that I didn't like about it.   	One reason I didn't like it was because in the opening scene, the main character (Rory) was outside watching her dad cut down a tree in their yard and she was talking about how great the tree was.  And when I first started reading it, I was like "okay, she must really like that tree," but after about 20 pages of her talking about this tree, you get annoyed and don't want to read it anymore.  The only reason I kept reading it was because it was for school and it was incredibly easy to read so I kept reading.  I also didn't like it because I didn't think that the author described things in the book too well.  When I read a book I like to know what each character looks like but in this story she really didn't give much to what the people and environment were like.  I also didn't like how they kept talking about drawing and how to draw and everything, so that got kind of boring.  	So I finished the book.  And it didn't get much better.  But there were some things I kind of liked about it.  For most of the book, I could really relate to what Rory was going through.  I think most girls have a friend that they start to lose, and most teenage girls have an off-and-on relationship with her parents, so that's why I kept reading.  The way the author had the girls act around boys and teachers and their parents is very realistic so I think anybody reading it knows exactly what the characters in the book are going through.  I think that teenage girls who love to draw would like this book. 
 Wow, it does pain me to knock on Bon Jovi, I love New Jersey, Slippery, Keep The Faith, Cross Road, Crash and Have a Nice Day. All albums are uplifting and cheerful and all contain a handful of raise-your-fist-in-the-air anthems.  I loved all these songs the first time around. Now all the songs, and the album as a whole, has this morbid, undertaking tone to it, as if Johnny Cash was their inspiration behind re-recording their greatest hits stripped down.  The low point is It's My Life, the original is such an upbeat and uplifting anthem, that listening to this version makes me want to drive my car off a cliff, it's that big of a downer! This album is reminiscent of John Mellencamp's Rough Harvest cd, where Mellencamp re-records some hits and album tracks with a more raw, earthy feel to them, but to both artists why? My mother has always stated that she wants Bon Jovi's music to be played at her wake as she loves the band and is in my eyes Bon Jovi's biggest fan. Bon Jovi put out an appropriately themed album to all those fans hoping to have Bon Jovi played at their wake/funeral. 
 this book wasn't all that great.  and, that's being nice.  i love horror, and it had mediocre reviews on here, so i thought i'd check it out.  i was disappointed.  it does have some good points.  i enjoyed the sections with the young babysitter and the little girl she was watching.  but, the rest just sorta sucked.  the rape scene wasnt frightening.  it was ignorant.  and, it isnt all that gory of a novel.  as for the political point, we get it.  that factor is too simple, too cliched, and too trite to mention.  also, the trying to overcome the racism aspect of the book makes the book racist in itself.  as simple as it is to read, im having a hard time getting through to the end.  and, the other reviewer on here was right, he uses the word "rump" about 117 times in the novel.  buy another book, instead.  or, do what i did, check it out at the library 
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
 If you can understand this book you are obviously incapable of living in  the real world. Sassen's dense, turgid writing style simply aims to  bewilder the reader into unquestioningly accepting her doomsday view of  socitey. Most depressing reading 
 Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.  I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel.   What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative. Hardly any good.   Truth is I found it rather juvenile. In my my mind I found myself editing out the excess wordage. Perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story. There really isn't much here.  Indeed It isn't a good story. No challenge to the reader at all. Blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of.    It has all the defects of the first book compounded.   Toss it. 
 This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material. 0 stars 
 This show is my all time favorite, however Universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser, and a wrong Season Premier Intro!  DVD is meant to bring out the best in media, not the worst, how could they lose sound effects? Unbelievable! Just doesn't seem possible... SEASON 4 is no better...  UNIVERSAL PLEASE READ THIS AND RE-RELEASE SEASON 3 AND 4 ALREADY, THE FANS ARE EXTREMELY PISSED OFF! 
 I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.      I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string "telephone" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.      The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly.         I returned the receiver and both kits the next day. 
 The Next Attack is one of the latest - and worst - examples of popcorn political diatribes that lack substance, intellectual heft and reasoned analysis.  Unlike Through our Enemies' Eyes and Imperial Hubris, the Next Attack makes unsubstantiated histrionic pronouncements and offers the authors' opinions dressed up as meaningful observations.  Moreover, they offer little to give meaning to the subtitle of the book - there is virtually nothing of substance relating to "a strategy for getting it right."  If you're only going to read one book about what's right and wrong (and there is a great deal wrong with it) this, unfortunately, isn't it 
 This book could have been edited better before being published, as I have found several typos,  misspelled and misused words in just the first two chapters 
 American Originals is a poor, dry shadow of The American Religion written  by Harold Bloom several years ago.  It has none of the thrill of following  and intimately disecting the american direction in  religious ontology.  It  has an overall air of Ho-Hum.  A feeling of "I wrote this book because  I could."  Not that its facts are terribly inaccurate but the point is  that if I wanted a dictionary of religious history I would have bought one 
 Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working.  Horrible customer service!  Will never buy from this company again! 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck 
 Petra Haden, OK I thought this would be some polite folk jazz record to break her into the biz, but this is just a PoP record!! It sounds like any female alternative singers CD, and is in the field of mood music. I know Bill Frisell likes to break the rules, and some say "what rules", but why does he not play -Free music, Drum n Bass, contemporary classical music- enc? Bill is a talented musician, but this is less than a bright moment. 
  'Out of Body Experiences' book is fairly good. It contains a bunch of neat diary entries and exercises that are easy to follow. It lacks the New Age hype, which is good for some, and is definitely not as dry as other OBE books out there. And the author is pretty encouraging with his experiences.  However, this book lacks important information! There is absolutely little, if any, information on negative entities and a host of other things you can find in the astral. But if you just want a bit of info on the astral for starters, this is your book. But I find this one, for me, is not very helpful in the fact all of the info in this book can be found on various webpages (on the robert peterson website, where you can read the entire book), so I just wasted 13 bucks. But if you want serious, highly effective astral experiences enroll in a Gnosticweb course or read an 8 week course on Astral Projection by bezlebuub 
 There is a reason 1984 and Animal Farm are the famous ones this book is dull. It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him. I looked all through the book and couldn't find a plot 
 I have always loved the Kinsey Millhone series, they used to be fun and entertaining. But this book is different, it just can't keep my attention. The story may be authentic, but is so thin that it could have been written in 10, maybe 12 pages, at the most! The 'filler' story is boring to the point it puts me to sleep. Descriptions of clothes, meals, surroundings, you name it - ANYTING - are so totally unnecessary and actually get silly if it wasn't so annoying.   Too bad. I'll think twice before buying an other Sue Grafton 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 I don't feel that Miller made much of an attempt to prove that Anna was in fact a "good" mother. Like another reviewer said, I don't think she was a BAD mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about Anna's relationship with Molly (especially up until Anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on Anna's life experiences and psyche. After Brian said he wouldn't send Molly back, Anna didn't even seem that concerned about Molly's mental and emotional well-being. She just focused on her notion that Leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see Molly again, I got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her "rights" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.   And what was so great about Leo anyway?? He wasn't exactly nice to Anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning I felt that his affection for Molly was a farse, simply to stay on Anna's good side. He also seemed sexually possessive of Anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after Molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. I think Anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. As a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. Although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. If she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new "family" she and Leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child. 
 The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood!  His other tiny book  Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!    
 Very poor insight into the Red and White which is why I bought the book.Comes across as a wannabe who could'nt cut it when the going got tough 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 I purchased a copy of Magellan Worldwide Basemap. I installed it in my computer but it would not run. When this also happened to a second computer I installed it on I contacted Magellan Technical Support. After asking me about the relative positions of stickers on the back of the CD jewel case I was told I had a defective disk and was offered a replacement in 4 to 6 weeks! Since I will have returned from my trip to Europe before the replacement arrives the product is totally useless to me. Don't buy this product until they have "good" disks available. The good ones have the stickers on the back of the jewel case in an "L" configuration, on the bad disks the stickers are parallel 
 While this book may be based, in part, on some reality, their claims of the total amount of gold involved are beyond ridiculous, and completely unsupported, and thus, the book is more likely to be purposful disinformation, or lies put out by the establishment, on purpose, to try and discredit gold as an investment.  The reality is that paper money is the real fraud, based on many frauds such as fractional reserve banking.  The real truth is that central banks have been secretly selling gold for years to suppress gold prices to prop up their paper currencies.  The real stats are that the world has mined about 150,000 tonnes of gold in all of human history, and the world mines about 2500 tonnes per year, and that demand stands at about 5000 tonnes per year.  Central banks have now sold about half of their 30,000 tonnes, and without prior selling of 1500 tonnes of gold per year, the gold price would have been, and will be, much higher.  
  I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:  The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.    All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.    So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.    I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.   By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.    Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.  I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.  Jeff 
 My twins loved the similar toy I bought at Dollar Tree. The one at Dollar Tree has a duck or pig in center instead of a red mass.   I cannot believe they charge this much for the same thing 
 "Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU 
 The other reviews are on the mark with content: this is a superb film. My low rating is due solely to the poor production standards of the DVD set. No digital remastering here. The grainy transfer to DVD looks every bit of twenty years old. No sound enhancements either, only a single AC3 stereo channel. Worst of all, Alastair Cooke's episode introductions, which accompanied the series when it was originally shown on Masterpiece Theatre, have been eliminated, replaced with cheap graphic images of the production company's logo. Unfortunately, this is the only Region 1, NTSC-format of this important series that we are likely to get. 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.  I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.  Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.  Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway. 
 George Kiseleff stars as Gary Ridgway or The Greeennnn Rivverrrr Killeerrrr. Anyways he is married and has a son and goes out to bars, picks up some prostitutes and either brings them back to his place when his wife is gone and makes his son hide in the bathroom when he kills them or somewhere else. Then after he kills his victims he brings the bodies of the women and stashes them alongside the Green River...um, yeah. They also have actually footage of the real Ridgway sprinkled in. Also during this boring piece of crud he narrates the women's names. Gloria, Pamela, Betty, Veronica, Dolly, Molly...whatever. The acting is beyond awful and it's direction is sloppy. The writing is idiotic as well as the dialouge. It seemed like it would never end when I was watching it. I wasnt actually screaming for it to end, I was just annoyed. BLAH!! 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 It was hard to use and understand 
 I got this book to learn Mac OS X programming and was very disappointed.  There's way too much info on Mac OS 8 and 9, which is great for people who are migrating old applications; but if you're writing new applications like I am, it just gets in the way.  Many screenshots are old and do not look like OS X windows.  It talks about CDEF resources, which do not work in OS X; it does not talk about the updated way custom controls are done.  Code samples use WaitNextEvent(), which is deprecated.  There's nothing on quartz, but lots of info on quickdraw, which is deprecated.  Nothing on HIView, OpenGL, etc.  It appears that this was a great book in its day, but now, it'll probably just confuse you 
 I go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn't want to leave the house.  I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising.  The routines are broken down into four separate workouts.  The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section.  As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them.  I think this DVD is great for beginners.  Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon.  But if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn't the abs workout for you 
     Okay, let's get one thing straight, the acting was pretty good. All the kids were cute and adorable and do a pretty darn good job on their parts. Vin Diesel is good and lovely to watch, and Lauren Graham is in the movie!  (Think: Lorelai Gilmore).  Though, Lauren looked different for some reason, I couldn't quite place it; added pounds? new hair style?  I don't know... anyway onto the storyline, or lack there of.    To put it simply, it appears the object was to write a movie with Vin Diesel in it, in the style of Kindergarten Cop.  However, someone failed to hire a good writer, or director!  They rushed through the intro and cut through the blah-blah's (substance) of the story just so they could arrive at the part where they could "showcase" Vin Diesel in this role of a  tough guy caring for some adorable kids.  It's not convincing; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you had whiplash.  All in all, it's probably a great movie for kids about 8, 9, 10 years old.   
 I share my bad experience with Seiko Monster and some say Im stirring up trouble. Hey, we're in a democracy when I last checked. Duh.  Yeah maybe I am spreading the word about my faulty Seiko Monster but that's the TRUTH and I want others to know that my Seiko Monster was defective. At least Im not a dumb fanatic Seiko Monster cultist who idolizes this watch with a candle-lit shrine, chants, and ritual. For crying out loud, it's just a watch, an inanimate spiritless object, that does not have feelings or civil rights! But it did hurt that I wasted $150 for this bad watch. I dont care about giving the watch a chance, regulating, breaking it in, etc. What happened to my Seiko Monster is that it stopped, which is not good, so I returned for an exchange. 
 The reviews posted on the site are longer than the book. It is less than 100 pages long and about 1/4" thick. I know it is a "value" book but it's a tiny, quick read that would be more suitable to a Good Housekeeping magazine (granted not PG rated!) than a book 
 I am a huge fan of Nick Bantock and his trilogies, and was looking forward to his latest novel.   This story was not intriguing as his past movels, and the "artwork" was almost non-existent.  I was so disappointed, and suggest that if you want to read it, check it out of the library and don't waste your money.  I'm going to re-read Griffin & Sabine again, just for the thrill of it 
 In my opinion to flashy, they are only taking advantage of the popularity of tequila, you can not even find it in Mexico. I would recommend much more books like "The Book of Tequila" by Mr. Emmons with real facts and tequila  information 
 A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI & 4 dead pixels.  The replacement TV had even more dead pixels & Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon & Visa all gave me a horrible time & no respect.  So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now & still fighting for a refund.  My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection & no worries 
 Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years.   I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.  I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research. It is NOT usable. Most of the text is missing. I have never seen such a bad scanning result. Unbelievable. 
 I read and enjoyed The Faerie Wars a few months ago, and so was excited to start the sequel when I came across it. My excitement waned as I got into the book, however. There were three things that particularly disappointed me. Through most of the book, there are a number of subplots happening simultaneously which come together in the climax. Brennan breaks the subpolts up into small peices, telling about this one for a few pages and then that one for a few pages, and then this other one, and then back to the first one, and so on. It seems that he wants to create suspense and keep the reader engaged, however for me it just made the book awkward and choppy. I had some trouble keeping the plots straight and understanding why certain episodes were significant to the overall story. There are some that I still think are totally irrelevant. I realize that this is a work of fantasy and not meant to be realistic or anything, but some of the things we encounter in the book are completely unbelievable. He introduces a whole new group of faeries, the forest faerie, who are very numerous, have advanced technology, and are skilled fighters. Where did these guys come from? How did they get so good at combat if they've been hiding in the forest and never fighting anyone? And how is it that they're so numerous and yet have never been detected? It just doesn't add up for me. It seemed a quick, cop-out way to get things done. Like he needed a force to take on the deamon army, so he made these guys come out of the woodwork. Then there's the ending. I didn't appreciate the values that are condoned in the ending of the book. I'm not going to tell any interested readers exactly what happens except that the main characters, the "heroes," pull off a very significant act of deception in order to get their way. While it does end up leading to a happy ending, I can't accept that they got there by immoral means and got out of accepting responsibility for their actions. So in general, I was didn't like this book a whole lot. I won't be reading the next sequel should there be one 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull. 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making.  Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate.  Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book.  Try to find "Decorating with Seashells" by Anita Louise Cran 
 As I was perusing the reviews to decide whether or not I wanted to purchase this book, one thing has struck me as strange. Has anyone noticed that all the five star reviews are from "a reader" and are written in basically the same style? All of them are very well-written, complete with proper grammar---the kind of correct grammar that only a professional writer uses. It's making me skeptical about the good reviews this book has recieved. 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 It's difficult to believe that John Patrick Shanley, shortly after winning an Oscar for "Moonstruck," penned this abominable movie.  What was he thinking?  "The January Man" tries to be a comedy, a mystery, a romance, and a thriller, but it fails miserably on all levels.  With an all-star cast including Kevin Kline, Alan Rickman, Rod Steiger, Susan Sarandon, and Harvey Keitel, you'd think this would be a gem.  Alas, it's just a big mess with an implausible storyline, awful dialogue, and no chemistry between the actors.  It's rare and appalling to see so much talent produce so poor of a movie 
 All the ingerdients for a satisying space opera - put together, as dull, dull, dull 
 I read this book in a capstone business course, and was sorely disappointed. The language is simple, and so are the concepts. It's probably good reading for the new business person. However, it lacked  sophistication and insight, and didn't challenge me very much. In fact, I  had to use a second strategic management text to add depth to what was  contained in Stoner and Fry's text 
 For one to understand why Hemingway wrote a book of this caliber, it must  be understood that Sherwood Anderson, whom Hem parodied, had just had a  contract signed by Hemingway.  An offer had also been made by Scribner's  which was more prestiegeous of the two literary firms.  To get out of the  contract, Hem offered this book, which he knew would be turned down by  Anderson's firm, thus giving Hemingway the chance to accept Scribner's  contract.  The book was not intended as a great literary work, and thus  must be examined in the light of which it is written.  There are many funny  idosyncrasies which Hem used for some of the characters in the book.  Most  of these came from people he knew there in Paris.  Entertaining?  Yes it  was to me.  A great literary work?  It achieved what he was looking for.   So you be the judge 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 I'm really bad. Really really bad. I'm a fan of WKW, but I haven't even seen a Godard film... the source of inspiration not only for WKW but for many designers out there in the world. His work, especially this movie, is heavily referenced in many books and journals... and yet, I haven't seen it... until now that is. Contempt was filmed in Franscope format, which at the time was very cutting edge, and grandiose... very special and very widescreen... with an all star cast...Bridgitte Bardot, Jack Palance, and Fritz Lang playing himself. The subject here is Homer's Odyssey (which makes sense for the choice of Franscope as the medium)...but while some scenes DO in fact take place in ruins like Rome's inconsequential stage version of itself, Cinecitta... as well as scenes in temples... I mean the famous Villa Malaparte... most of the movie takes place "inside"... inside living rooms, inside bathrooms, inside the bedroom... on the surfaces of rugs, sofas, tables, chairs, on the surface of skin, Bardot's skin that is. All filmed in widescreen in all it's glory. But there is nothing to film. There is struggle, but not anything "epic" that we are used to see as filmgoers, as befitting to see for widescreen viewing. Okay this review is going tooo long... but so did the movie. WKW film a lot... I MEAN ALOT... about nothing... but they were great movies... with so much substance... so much struggle, with themes sooo epic and rotund, that one can return to the same movie in different times of their lives and pick up something new. While Contempt does not necessarily do that... it does call into question the role of the director, the story, the medium, the actor, the character, the audience, and the epic. All these relationships are assessed and re-assessed all the time throughout the film. If you're comfortable with the density of it all, then it's fine... but sometimes we just want to be the audience, because that's easy... that's safe... and that's comfortable. WKW separates us from them, but enables us to feel as if we were them... Godard offers no such separation, no release, and no grand ending (as is the case with this movie). We don't even feel anything for Godard, for the film, and for them... nor do we feel anything different about us after this epic journey is through. Call me old fashioned, but I want a good ride 
 This documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies, by law, have an obligation to their stockholders, rather than to society at large.  But this isn't the only case where 'people' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities.  What about doctors?  When a doctor treats you, by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you.  Shouldn't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way?  Shouldn't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you?    And what about accountants and lawyers?  Every time an accountant handles someone's money, he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person's life savings and give it to charity.  It's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests.  What about the greater good?  And your lawyer should never act mainly for you - each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally, rather than giving special emphasis to her own client.  Let's get serious - in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders, who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy, it must first meet all obligations to others, or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line.  As an ongoing business, companies have reason to care about their reputations, about earning loyalty from their employees, etc.  Yes, some companies have done bad things, just as some people have done bad things.  Can every single person be condemned as a psychopath, simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths?    Corporations, like people, can do harmful, dangerous things.  There's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred.  But it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations, just as it regulates people.    The example of Bolivia, where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater, is an example of the failure of government.  Why would the government give such rights to anyone, even itself?  But when government regulation has been adequate, privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries.  Demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous.  Corporations, and individuals, should be regulated by governments.  If outrages are not detected and punished, then government has failed.  But we shouldn't abolish government, or corporations, or people, simply because none are perfect.  We should 1) hold governments accountable for performing their role; 2) hold corporations accountable for legal violations (through fines, and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases, as has happened many, many times); and 3) use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions.  If you really care about the poor around the world, then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs - on bad government 
 I'm evaluating the DVI version.  The cables are sold seperately, so what's the point to buy a KVM without cables?!?  Lastly, hearing the problems doesn't surprise me, as working with the two port version, I had some problems where computers becames unresponsive 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 While very attractive this desk suffers from what so many inexpensive computer desks do an inadequately sized keyboard drawer.   There is enough room for the keyboard but not enough for a mouse.  This results in forcing you to have to reach forward to use the mouse on the top of the desk. I ultimately decided just put he keyboard on top the desk and raise up my chair.  The manufacturer should consider eliminating one of the drawers and extending the keyboard shelf 
 This book was hard to understand. I would not recommend  this one to those who are just curious, like myself. 
 I had given 5 stars to "Valuation," but I feel that this workbook is practically useless for its price. The problems in this book are not very challenging; they merely require echoed answers instead of questions providing in-depth analysis. Common questions include: "Name three issues in valuating X company" or "Name three reasons why X is preferred over B." These are simple questions one could easily answer by taking copious notes. I had expected much more challenging questions from the workbook, but I was sorely disappointed. My advice: Buy "Valuation" but avoid buying this book 
 As one pursuing a master's degree in Library Science, I was required to buy this book for my reference course.  I have found it to be poorly written and organized and of little practical use.  Someone out there must be able to know enough about reference techniques to write a more coherent and interesting text on the subject.  
 Organization? Perhaps in a Faulkner stream-of-consciousness sense. "Applications" is _chapter 14_. The topic emphasis has little to do w/ the needs of most developers. You get two entire chapters on "Design Time Integration", whereas you get a small (two page) subsection on "Keyboard Handling" and likewise "Scrolling". Gee, how about if I want to handle the _arrow keys_!? Maybe you could explain scrolling in more than a paragraph of English text? How about an example? To top it off, it's in a narrative & chummy style. Yuck 
 This very thin tome demonstrates that the author has no understanding of research or scholarship. It is nothing more than a plagiarised version of the very few sources quoted in the lamentable section entitled "REFERENCES". Anyone seriously interested in  sausages would be well advised to give this booklet a wide berth and perhaps purchase the somewhat antiquated but nonetheless scholarly work of Antony and Araminta Hippisley-Coxe entitled "The Great Book of Sausages" 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 The book provides no exciting findings for strategic decision makers. The only idea this book has is to distinguish uncertainties into four levels and it uses this four-level frame in its following discussions. And even the four-level classification is cliche. You can skip contents after chapter 3 without regretting anything 
 This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed.  Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic.  The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.    
 After getting this guide I was pretty disappointed.  It DOES have fairly good suggestions on what the individual units do, but the descriptions don't go much past the ones provided in the manual that comes with the game.  After the unit descriptions the guide provides basic guidelines on how to win each race's single player campaign, broken down into phases just like the game.  What I was most looking for however, were tips on attack and defense strategies, as well as tips for multiplayer.  This is where the guide is lacking, having only a few pages worth of tips unlike guides for most other RTS games that I have seen.    To sum it up, unless you are having a hard time completing Supreme Commander's single player campaigns, this guide delivers very little that the game's instruction manual does not already provide. 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 For $20 I don't even bother to return things, but this article is a disgrace, almost completely useless. Save your money 
 This release drew the line for me with Aerosmith. There music on this and the following material up to date contain complete chaos.  Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts.  This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned. I have the first four releases (Aeromsith, Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5*****), but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there.  Or maybe I am just old 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 The book's jacket announces somewhat presumptuously: "students on campus tell you what you really want to know."   My kids are interested in pre-med and business.  My neighbor's kid is interested in pre-law.  Clearly the Yale Daily News Staff assumes we don't want to know about the average scores undergraduates make on the standardized tests they take in college.  Yet, a high school kid thinking ahead to professional schooling might well want to know how students do on the MCAT, GMAT or LSAT tests at different colleges.  Just like the undergrad schools that use SAT scores as one factor in their admissions process, high school students could use this later college test information as one factor in their choice of schools.  But high school students are out of luck.  These data aren't included in the Common Data Set, and the Yale Daily News Staff doesn't ask for them.   The Yale Daily News Staff also assumes that we don't want any hard data about campus crime.  They ignore completely the information that colleges must make publicly available under the Clery Act.   Instead we get chirpy PR snippets such as that reported for the University of Pennsylvania: "Some students are concerned for their safety in the local community, but most people agree that safety in the area has 'really improved recently'." They deftly duck the issue of just how bad safety was before and what today's crime numbers are.  It's just another don't-rock-the-boat and somewhat lazy effort by a college guidebook publisher 
 First of all, let me this out of the way: There was nothing wrong with the way these DVD were covering the season from 2003 back. Nothing wrong with looking at the season of racing as a season and not a showcase for chase drivers. Please go back to it.  Based on that, folks can take my review with a grain of salt or not.  My second problem is that there is double introduction, the second of which is painfully long and cliché ridden. So much so I had to turn off the TV twice. Seriously, whoever wrote that narrative needs to graduate High School first. It was horribly over-the-top melodramatic and just non-stop cliches. The intros are for people who are completely unfamiliar with the sport, which market wise, I sort of get. But the fact is newbies aren't buying these DVD's. Fans are, you don't need to explain and sell the sport to us again.  The approach of looking at the various racing teams was a nice way to come at covering how the year went for the "big names", but that left out a lot of other drivers. There are 43 cars in the field each week and this DVD covers, maybe, 15 of them? It also failed to point out how the single and double car teams struggled. The coverage often did not specify in what races/tracks events/incidents happened, so that if this DVD is for newbies (as suggested by the double intro), it would be extremely confusing.  It also left out the swirling rumor of mill of one of the silliest "Silly Seasons" NASCAR has ever seen with all the speculation and seat changing that happened between 2005-2006. Thought it was funny that they pointed out Ricky Rudd's remarkable career, then forgot to mention he lost his ride. Sterling too. They also didn't mention someone's shocks at Dover or other incidents that had the fanbase talking for weeks.  The extras were..o.k.. Tell us something we don't know that we might be interested in, that what DVD extras are for! I did like the meeting at Roush where we got to see Jack Roush reaction to the initial "shot across the bow" when France suggesting limiting the number of cars an organization can field. But that was pretty much it. It actually would have nice to expand on that for a mini-documentary to get reactions of owners, CC and drivers across the board. Sort of like the "What makes a good crew chief?" from last year's DVD.  The good things? They had a lot of great radio chatter. Thumbs up on that. Often when fans are watching a race we don't get the hear the funny stuff on TV, or if we are at the race we only hear our driver. It's nice to hear drivers cracking jokes, makes the entire experience more human. We got to see some angle of incidents that we didn't get to in regular coverage too.   I really, really wish these guys would get their act together on these things. I don't collect much NASCAR stuff, but I look forward to getting these at the end of the year: A nice scrapbook of the season. The last two years it's been pretty lame.  
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career 
 I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy.  They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet. 
 ZERO STARS, BUT THAT ISNT AN OPTION...-So lets say, "F" for effort... Let me start by saying I love the horror/gore genre, but junk like this needs to be put to an end...at some point enough has got to be enough...this "movie" was shot using a canon xl (at best)...apparently film was out of the question...the acting is miserable, the camera work and lighting was a joke...and the violence and gore was laughable...and I dont mean laughable like outrageous...but laughable because it is that bad...hack editing ruins every death scene...the only real gore comes in the form of various characters spitting gallons of blood after altercations...the highlight of the "movie" was a dude putting a melon on this dude head and then shooting a 9mm through it...as if things couldnt get any worse...these clowns didnt take the time to sync the dialogue to the lip motions...AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS...you have been warned.. 
 This is a copy of the review on Amazon.com for Van Zant's Get Right With The Man which is another Sony corrupted title.  "This CD secretly installs DRM (digital rights management) software on your PC without your permission. Not only does it do this, but the software then hides itself by installing as a "root kit."

 DID/MPD is a psuedo-psychological fad, just like repressed memory therapy, that is not in any way validated by the true Science, Medical, or Psychiatric professions.  Every case of supposed MPD ever studied by any accredited Psychiatrist has been shown to be merely a product of suggestion by a disreputable therapist.    If you wish to read a harrowing story of real abuse survival and not some science fiction rubbish, read A Child Called "It", by Dave Pelzer.  It is simply amazing to me that there are so very many real, documented, verifiable cases of actual extreme mental, physical, and sexual abuse survivors out there, and that NOT ONE OF THE DOCUMENTED REAL CASES DEVELOPED MPD OR DID!  Maybe that's because there is no such thing as DID/MPD, and those people like "Trudi Chase" who claim actual abuse and make up sensational science fiction stories in order to get rich and sell books should be ashamed of themselves.  By the way, it's a well known and highly accepted FACT in the Psychiatrical and Medical community that Sybil was all a lie as well.  Do a search and see what those taped transcripts actually reveal.  Her "therapist", and I use the term in extreme sarcasm, named her alleged personalities and asked her to "let me speak to that part of you that feels that certain way, we'll call that part Helen, ok?"  Educate yourselves.  Read this and enjoy it as a piece of total fiction.  If you want fact, read Dave Pelzer.  
 I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede 
 I was all excited after reading about him on-line and I had the impression this would truly be an insightful book.  Well, he talks a lot, most of it common sense. I'm pretty disappointed by it 
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 If you read my other reviews you will see I am one of the biggest fans of Lonesome Dove and even Return to Lonesome Dove. But Streets  of Laredo is nothing like Lonesome Dove except for the names. Call a bounty hunter give me a break. But what is even crazier than that is Lorena married to Pea Eye. I think Larry made this so far out there to get back at Hollywood for their movie. What he didn't realize was he was hurting the fans who loved Lonesome Dove so much with this stupid ending. Any true fan of Larry's Lonesome Dove has to know this was not the way he had envisioned this to end when he wrote Lonesome Dove. Very disappointed in Larry's ending, give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week. 
 I now know why I had not heard much about this movie.  Only buy it if you like Broadway musicals because it is not your typical Doris Day movie.  I feel like I am watching parts of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when the prince says "I just want to sing" 
 
 I just wasted a ridiculous number of days slogging through this disappointingly pretentious work.  In it, Daniel Rowlands, an American reporter, is working on a book about the concept of romance as developed in the Arthurian legends and in the artwork of the pre-Raphaelites.  He becomes involved with some mysterious femme fatale in London who may or may not have also been involved with the actual pre-Raphaelites during their heyday over 100 years ago.  Is she a ghost?  Is she a goddess?  Is she mad?   You would think it would be hard to miss with a plot like that, and indeed according to the back cover blurb, scary story master Peter Straub himself says "it is the product of an exceptionally gifted writer using her mind and heart to blast through every limitation or restriction. . . writing as if to create her own life."  Or again there is this from The Washington Post:  "What lies behind the complex, even violent process that we call artistic inspiration? That is the final mystery evoked in Elizabeth Hand's ambitious and richly imagined novel. By tracing the turbulence and reverberations of that process back to its source, Mortal Love offers its readers the satisfactions of a detective thriller. Here, however, the mystery goes deeper than murder. Nothing, Hand convinces us, is quite as mysterious as art."  No, nothing is as mysterious as art.  Except perhaps why (knowing that the "heroine" is either a dangerous immortal being whose mere touch can destroy a man's mind; or else merely dangerously insane) -- why, knowing this, does Daniel's best friend make a big effort to get Daniel and this possible madwoman together in the first place on page 42 and then literally from page 57 onward keep warning  Daniel to have nothing to do with her?  Now that's a real mystery.  And why I should care about Daniel, his best friend or the mad woman.  That is another mystery, even greater than the last.    The book has lots of stylish writing with vivid lovely descriptive passages; it has lots of clever "literary" devices, like using three different narrators at three different points in time, some of whom may be unreliable.  It even has what is apparently becoming obligatory in so-called "literary" novels, the precious touch of self-reference (the main character is in London to write a book called "Mortal Love").  It has quotes in Old English and French and Latin; it has numerous references to obscure artists and writers who actually lived; it has BIG THEMES about the nature of love, art, sex and death.  But you know, it has not one single character whose fate I actually cared about at all at any point in the story.    This was one of many well-reviewed literary novels I've read lately that has lots of cleverness and no real heart.  Frankly, if this is the best the "literary" world has to offer lately, I would rather read a romance novel or a children's book that features some realistic people whose fate actually matters to me. 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 I never thought the music of Charles Mingus could be made to sound so unemotional.  The performance is lifeless compared to any of the originals.  Wynton Marsalis's latest effort to score a historical piece for an orchestra again fails.  As with Coltrane's A Love Supreme, the original small group performance set the bar very high.    That is not to say that any attempt to score these works is a guarenteed failure (see many recordings by the Mingus Big Band).  The reason these works fail along with many other of Marsalis's are due to a lact of emotional fire, and originality (the artist must at least attempt to provide some personal statement to the piece, or all you can to is compare it to the original).           
 This film got one star for the scenery.  Of the 135 minutes it was 130 minutes to long and of wasted time.  Don't waste your time with this one 
 Director Steve Kloves manages to make Texas look both gorgeous and desolate.  Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances.  What destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering, its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending.  FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable.  Kloves "twist" is predictable from the moment Meg Ryan appears on the screen, and the inevitable confrontation between Quaid and Caan is also telegraphed a mile away.  In spite of its good performances and atmospheric direction, FLESH AND BONES is empty and pointless 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 If you want a Cracker "Greatest Hits", get Garage D'Or instead.   If you're a big fan and want to support the band, get "Greatest Hits Redux".  BTW, word is that a new album is coming this summer 
 This is a book that offers zero new insights! What's worse... there are a lot of bold statements in this book, that I don't share. The authors have forgotten to share the evidence for these statements, so I can not take them very seriously 
 I have checked out almost every card shuffler in the market. And I can tell you that apart from the one made by Excalibur they are all the same, and Cardinal is not an exception. So here is my review.  This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.   1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy  2. Door Stop  3. Play Street Hockey  4. Stress Release Stomping Toy  5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift  6. Modern Art for Coffee Table  7. Nerf Ball Target Practice  8. Condom Dispenser   Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!   PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it. 
 I used to love Light & Tasty, then they decided to change the look and format, even though reader surveys said keep it the same.  The new look is hard to read, and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular.  There are less pictures of the finished dishes, and the pictures they do show are smaller.  They added full page ads for thier country store products, which goes against the no ad promise.  I have subscribed for years, but this new look is horrible.  Get it at the store to see if you like it first 
 It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 Don't let a fondness for Proustian luxe sucker you into purchasing this book containing mediocre photography and a text of perfumed flatulence.  The ostensible purpose of the book is to reveal French urban, aristocratic taste as of the late twentieth century, or more accurately the taste of their designers (the usual cast of Henri, Renzo, etc.)and other arbiters of taste (Hubert, Alexis, Carlos, etc.).  Certainly, there are more than enough interiors of the mummefied magnificence that comes from cocooning staggering numbers of objects in layer after layer of fabric (WARNING:  Do not try at home.  If you do not possess first-rate things and have access to the production from the best mills in Italy and France, you will achieve only The Old Junkshop look), but the pictures are uniformly fuzzy, muddy and printed on poor quality paper.  Most maddening of all, the photography neglects genuine masterpieces (you cannot catch more than a glimpse, for example, of the incomparable Ingres portrait of Betty Rothschild) while devoting page after page to boring tabletop vignettes usually consisting of a few knicknacks and photographs of long-dead nobodies as children.  In fact, the real purpose of the book is apparently to provide the author with a vehicle to boast about her ancestors (many of those same long-dead nobodies) and the elegant life they led.  There is also a stench of moral decay most evident in the fawning description of Lady Mosley with an outrageous defense of British fascism before World War II.  Mostly, however, the premise of the book seems to be that you are what you own, or more accurately what you inherit -- a concept so inherently ridiculous that even the owners of the homes depicted in the book had the good sense for the most part to insist on anonymity.  If you truly want to revel in the atmosphere of things past, make yourself a cup of tea, find a hard biscuit and settle back in your recliner with the first volume of you know what 
 I might try to kill his a** for dropping this trash. I saw this garbage not too long ago and this is by far the worst stand up comedy I ever saw.  Jamie Foxx is a talented actor and thats just about it. I didnt laugh one time and I was half drunk watching this. I cant believe he actually gets paid for this. I should be paid for watching this s***. Amazon really needs to bless us with a zero star option because it is most needed 
 As a general rule, any film with a large number of Roman numerals behind it is going to suck, and the eighth outing of the F-13 franchise, JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, obeys this rule to a fanatical degree. This movie is terrible, an utter embarrassment, and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception.    By the fourth installment of the series, the ironically titled FINAL CHAPTER, this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old, blood-soaked boot. Jason Voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a*s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire. But the movie industry is an industry first, and when THE FINAL CHAPTER turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at Paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence. THE FINAL CHAPTER was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels, which saw Jason improve the Crystal Lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot-smoking teenage dimwits. By this time P-mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed, kill-crazy stepchild, yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on.   I still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in 1989. The audience ate it up. We actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing Jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home: the Big Apple. One could only imagine the bloody shennanigans Crystal Lake's least popular citizen could embark upon in New Yawk City! People were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the City of Lights. He could slay obnoxious Volcanoites! Teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways! Annihilate the snotty salespeople at Tiffanys! Cut down on panhandlers! Convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys! Run for mayor! We sixteen year olds LOVED the idea.  There was just one problem. The gang at Paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise. The ad campaign, like the title of the movie, was a fraud, and the only thing that got "taken" in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes.  First of all, the first 60 minutes of this 90-odd minute movie are not set in Manhattan, but  in Crystal Lake and then on a ship called the Lazarus (get it?) which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting-skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to New York. Jason, accidentally revived from the depths of the Lake by a jolt of electricity, stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to Manhattan Island. Unfortunately "Manhattan Island", with the exception of a couple of second-unit establishing shots, is largely an unimaginative-looking soundstage on the Paramount lot populated by Central Casting New Yawkers, including the usual mixed-race mugger team and an Irish cop who says things like, "Well, ye seem loike foine peeple, so I'll not be arresting ye."   There is not a single scary moment in the whole film, and there are not even any particularly interesting kills. Kane Hodder's plodding, rotting, thoroughly over-rated Jason looks almost bored, as if he signed onto the cruise by accident, and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship's entertainment director. To make up for the lack of any kind of suspense, the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters, and added nice little moments like a ship's crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before Jason runs a harpoon through his body. Classy stuff, but really, everything about the movie is stupid, from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed (shades of Crazy Ralph), to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims. Hell, the climax of the film features a chase through the New York sewers, which, we are told, flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight. (Does Rudy Guilani know about this?)  I realize having expectations for a Jason movie is silly, but even by the cellar-low standards of the franchise, this flick is a ripoff, a fraud, a dreadful fake, utterly stupid, appallingly bad, useless, terrible, and horrible. ZERO STARS. 
 I'm a big fan of Pat Benatar but this DVD is really poor.  The light and sound are really poor quality.  The energy level doesn't compare to her other live performances - probably because of the flow of the selections.  And it's only about an hour long.  Pat is great - but this DVD is certainly not her finest hour - not the way it's presented 
 If you already know how to use another photo-editing program and you're transitioning to PhotoShop, this might just be the book for you. It has a rather clever and innovative way to show exactly where on a cluttered screen the item under discussion is, and it also has some decent "quick tips". The examples are also pretty good. However, I don't see how anyone can claim to write a book that will "teach" you a software program if it doesn't give you exercises to work your way through; Photoshop is way too powerful and complex to learn without also practicing. It also doesn't explain why you might want to use any of its myriad features/effects/filters. But as I said, if you're transitioning from another program and you already know what any photo-editing program should do, this could be an excellent choice 
 I did a little research after trying to install this product and found that Symantec is no longer rated very well for Anti Virus.  One site that states this is Consumer Reports (they are towards the bottom of the ratings).  It has become major bloatware and its stability isn't what it used to be.  Maybe this is why Peter Norton sold his interests and bailed out.  I am far from being a novice, but this thing gave me a fight the whole way.  So on with my saga.  First, this product was supposed to be for Windows XP and 2000 Pro.  Even the box says this.  But when I insert the CD in a W2K Pro machine all I got was an error box showing the error icon and the OK button.  Real informative.  Going through the back door I try to install without going through the CD autostart program.  Now I get a box that says it requires XP 32 bit.  So that leaves out 2 of the machines I bought this for.  So I go to a machine running XP.  First one loads OK, but it says it is incompatible with my firewall (ZoneAlarm) which I happen to trust a lot.  Then on the second machine it goes through the install (which takes 45 min) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through.  I finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour (I was hoping it was just another slow moment).  Rebooted and the program was no longer running.  Starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load.  Now I'm stuck, it won't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again.  Had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every Symantec product on the machine.  Maybe this was the writing on the wall?  By now I'm a couple days into the drama.  Meanwhile, the first XP machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what.  It locked up half way through.  Now it will not run and had to be removed the same way.  So I am now the proud owner of ZoneAlarm's Internet Suite.  It cost less than the NAV (both 5 user versions), and loaded much faster.  Ten minutes and I was done, where it was an hour into NAV when things worked and it loaded.  I am taking this up with Symantec and trying to get a refund.  They can keep it.  I've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel's back.  Maybe I'll try again someday if I come up with a new camel, but they don't grow well in Seattle.  ADDED 3-12-2007:   I have also noted that after removing NAV that things I could not explain before have been cured.  For instance, the web site [...] would not load many of it's pages correctly, they would show the text coding instead of html.  Now that I am NAV free, all of the pages on this site load with no problems.  Hmmmm.. 
 Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
   The one star is not for Philip Roth, who of course is a major American novelist. The one star is for the book designer. Is Philip Roth such an incomparably great writer that, unlike James and Faulkner and Melville, his name needs to be emblazoned in giant white letters on the spine of the book? For the first time in the LOA series, the author's name does not appear in horizontal white calligraphic script; instead, it appears in giant white letters running vertically the length of the spine. So when you look at your bookshelves loaded with LOA volumes, "ROTH" leaps out at you.  I grow increasingly disenchanted with the LOA. It started promisingly enough, with the Northwestern-Newberry texts of Melville, the Univ. of California/Mark Twain Project texts for Twain, the Polk/Blotner texts for Faulkner, etc. Major writers complete in the most authoritative texts available -- a simple recipe for success.  Now, to fill its overly ambitious, overly prolific publishing schedule, LOA publishes journalism and second- and third-rate authors such as Dashell Hammett, Dawn Powell, and Paul Bowles. Why? Partially, at least, because the copyright on these authors' works is owned by Random House/Vintage, which seems to have a death grip on what LOA publishes. Commercial interest has, inevitably, overridden and diluted the initial vision of a canon of truly great American literature.  Not to mention that the series started with 1400- or 1500-page volumes being the norm. New volumes routinely have half that number of pages. The bean counters are doing math somewhere...  My two cents: publish fewer volumes and concentrate on the indisputably major authors. (Where is Melville's poetry?!) And publish no works by writers whose work has not passed out of copyright and into the public domain. Let time do its work of sifting out the writers who truly matter. Instant canonization is a farce. Unlike France with its comparable Pleiade series, America is a young country -- so of course the series will have fewer volumes. So what? LOA is sacrificing quality for quantity and going for the almighty dollar.   
 This book was/has been a major dissapointment, I have relied on every source imaginable for preparation for 70-210 and this one was particulary bad in that it ignores many items while putting emphasis on items you may not encounter. This book is ok if you just want to learn windows 2000 pro and be able to work with it, but not if you want to get certified. It completely neglects the novell/w2k enviroment and does not cover RIS/SYSPREP/unattended installations in enough detail. It's pretty crummy when the company who makes the software and the tests cant get it together 
 The book is very small, which should have been an indication.  Printed in India, most of the pages are blurred or faint printing.  Not readable.  A huge price for something unusable 
 I didn't find this book helpful at all. None of the example in the book sound even remotely like jazz. All this book has you do is play a bunch of boring chord tones and scales. Since so much of it is based on major chords, there is no bluesy sound to the examples. Souless and rote. Just the opposite of jazz 
 I am building my own house and find myself frequently referring to this book. There is much useful information; I only wish it were more up-to-date. It was published 12 years ago, but much of the info was out dated even then. And plumbing isn't exactly a rapidly changing field. The sad thing is that there aren't really any books out there that are much better. There is some info that is just plain wrong. I followed the book's instruction to use 45's to keep my sewer line from sloping more than 1/2" per foot, at great effort and expense... turns out it is not required, just an old plumber's legend. Be careful about following any of the advice in this book. Does anyone still use cast iron or copper dwv pipe? The book specifies a Kelly fitting for cleanouts. Is there any code which still allows that? Can you even buy a Kelly fitting? Most houses in the faster growing parts of the country are slab-on-grade and have been for years, but this book only devotes a few pages to this "new" concept. If you buy this book you need to be aware that much about plumbing is regional and code specific, and much of this book was out of date before it was published. It can still be a good source of info if you keep that in mind. 
 Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best 
 Have not yet seen the movie! This was one of the films I ordered for my very first HD order. Also included in the order were King Kong, Mission Impossible 1~3, The Good Shephard & Children of Men. Of these, only KK and MI 1~3 played on my new Xbox360 HD DVD player. The other three discs could not play! I started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the Xbox 360, although I only found this problem relating to The Good Shephard and Children of Men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with A Scanner Darkly during my search on the net, it could be that I was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this HD DVD. I have read that there will be update release from MS to correct this problem through Xbox Live, but I'm not sure this will fix the problem.  If you've got the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, be warned this may not work on your player.  Anyone else having this problem, I would certainly like to know 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 This is an awesome album.  Sadly, I have the same problem as others have reported, the audio plays out of only 1 channel.  Completely atrocious that the label would press a bunch of faulty CDs and continue to sell them after people have reported problems 
 Anyone who saw this film and gave this more that a 1 star rating must have been on some powerful halucingens to think this movies was anything other than a complete waste of time. Sure it looks good by the cover and the summary, but when I had a group of friends over to all watch this for the first time, we instantly realized why none of us had heard of this movie before. Even porn has higher callibur acting, cinematography, and dialog than this movie! The only saving grace to watching this film was the alcohol on hand to stomach it and having 8 catty friends openly rip it apart Like Tom Servo on Mystery Science Theater! DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! (luckily I got it as a gift).  
 I looked forward to reading this book as the third part of Mr. Hensall's discussion of the Nazi and Japanese advanced weapons program.  The first two books had appeared to be well-researched, and somewhat ground-breaking their thesis that the Nazis were quite intent on placing NBC warheads on the V1 and V2.I guess I was wrong.  This book is a rather workman-like recital of site details from the first two books to which is appended rumor, conjecture, and leaps of faith about what took place in the respective nuclear programs.  Facts are twisted and rumors made truths.The most glaring example of this is when Mr. Hensall recants a position from "Vengance"; namely that there were Bazi missile silos near Cherbourg.  He now says that they were pre-war French designed bases for gun turrets.  He passes on his mistake with a disingenuous, well that's what they looked like to me comment.Overall, a waste of time and money 
 I purchased this battery as a replacement for the original battery in my cordless telephone.  Although I fully charged the battery upon arrival, it will not hold a charge for more than 24 hours.  I would not purchase this battery again 
 The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books. The author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me. 
 I read "The Scar" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away.  I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.    While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did.  And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.  This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself 
 I recieved this calendar as a Christmas gift after raving about the book.  When I opened it at work I was very disappointed to discover that the the quality of the calendar was so poor.  I expected it to be in color!  The book was in color, the box was in color and nowhere did it let you know that it was in black and white.  Also the pictures are washed out and the paper is of a poor quality.  This was not worth the money my husband spent on it and I'm sorry to say that I'll have to buy a calendar because I can't stand looking at this one 
 I was some what dissapointed with this book because I found the author too worried about filling text rather than getting to the point.      I am a welder and really was looking for a book that discussed reasons, good  examples, and how to create wrought iron design. I was not looking for a  history lesson.       If you are looking for history on the art of Spanish,  Italian design etc. and where they were used,this would be the book for  you 
 I spoke with the author of this textbook (he was actually one of my professors at Berkeley for a different class) and apparently this textbook has a whole lot of incorrect information and math in it.  Go buy the newest version by the same author - it's much better 
 This dictionary WAS good up until my child was in 1st grade. Ever since then, we are unable to find words in this dictionary!!  It is a very frustrating experience for a child to actually use the book and then find this book does not have the words they need!! Only use this book for the early reader 
 Read the plan carefully.  Not everything is covered under this plan.  They will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don't have to pay.  Too many exclusions for an "everything is covered policy"  Don't waste your mone 
 Bobby Brown lost his flavor on this record.the songs Produced By New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley two can play that game,get away,till the end of time are tight as is the LA&Babyface cut good enough.but the problem is the  wack singing of Brown.he sounds flat.it wasn't as bad on this disc as it is  now.now he is a tone deaf.also while the album has highlights it has downs  as well.besides Bobby's bad singing some of the music make this album Don't  be cruel part 2.with the right voice this album would have been done  better 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 ...for a bunch of architects...lots of pretty pictures but no useful information -- e.g. sources...diagrams are too small and general to be of any use...they should be paying the buyer to read their ads -- not vice-versa 
 I was very disappointed in this translation. Bringing the language into  modern form distorted the meanings and lost the beauty and simplicity of  the original. I recommend Gitanjali if you want to experience real Tagore 
 I bought one for myself in NY and one for my grandson in CA.  Directions were followed exactly and NOTHING grew in either.  After numerous emails, new packages of seeds were sent.  And we both started over AGAIN.   This meant another 2 months in the frig.  And what happens?  Nothing grew again.  Being slow to learn, I decided to get more seeds and try it yet again.  Guess what.....nothing grew this time either.   So after 5 attempts with new seeds by two different people on opposite sides of the US, still nothing.  A complete waste of money!  
 I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance.  After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor.  The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.    The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).  We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the "blowouts", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean.  It has been a wonderful new baby tool 
 I obtained this book back in the eighties, when it cost $100(yes, that's right, I really wanted to get married in those days).  I got rid of it years ago, but I think that enough of it sticks in my mind that I can write a review.  One of the techniques she recommends is transference, which seems dangerously close to practicing psychiatry without a license.  She seems fixated on jewellry, particularly religious jewellry.  I actually wrote to her and asked if religious jewellry is such a turnoff, why do people think Madonna is so sexy? (This was in the eighties, remember)  Of course she didn't reply.  What really upset me about this book is the demeaning attitude toward men.  I guess that I'm too much of a romantic for such calculating approaches.  She says don't assume that you are different from other women and don't assume that the man you're after is that different from other men.  Excuse me?  Damn right he's different, and special, or I wouldn't care about him 
 DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA.  SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade (save for the Windows startup music).  I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back.  Might have, but it says not compatible with Vista.  I guess I'll be getting a new computer.  : 
 This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.   I was expecting some new information about a "secret language".  There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the "secret"? I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip.  The author says that cats do not get lonely.  Well, that's wrong.  He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.  How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?   The title was deceiving 
 Readers seeking to develop an understanding of the history and complexities of the  middle east conflict, with no investment in advancing the cause of either side, would be much better served by a more balanced presentation. While readable enough for this kind of thumbnail overview the author betrays his pedigree as a US-Israeli PR wonk throughout. The book is rife with unsupported statements casually tossed off as fact. Statements which may well be factually accurate but are so amateurishly presented that the credibility of the author's interpretation of events is done more harm than good. Uncited sources, unattributed facts and unconcealed bias in the language...what passes for scholarly work here is at best a useful timeline couched in a long-form pro-Israeli recruitment brochure. Reviewers claiming that any suggestion of bias is merely so much more anti-Zionist rhetoric should check their own axes for signs of grinding, then check out a better book on the subject. Producing a book that's easily readable needn't mean writing it poorly or without the substantiation and professional detachment that any respectable work of this nature demands. The target readers for this book may be "idiots", but they aren't dumb. The author trivializes the suffering of the Jews whose case he obviously supports and undermines his arguement by failing to give us credit for enough intelligence to draw our own conclusions without his subtle and not so subtle nudging.  Two stars if you simply want to spend half an hour skimming a what-happened-in-what-order sketch, zero if you're looking for substance, depth or well documented historical fact 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 A humorous account of another young 60s counter-culturist who was enlightened as a young man by hookers, opiates and SE Asian narcotics that "opened his eyes" to the "goodness and purity" of the Khmer Rouge, Viet Cong, Ho Chi Minh, Pathet Lao, "French enlightenment" of the Souteast Asian barbarians of the 19th century, and of course last but not least~ the absolute horrendous barbarity of the hegemonic & demonic US regimes that failed to truly understand these great organizations of the 50s thru 70s (yawn...).  He waxes on and on about his great acquaintences of Phnom Penh's and Hue's opiate dens as this "illustrious journalist" of the vaulted 4th Estate.  Pretty pathetic writing overall as I waded through all the despot worshipping until it just got way to sycophantical.  Saloth Sar, Ta Mok, Ieng Sary and General Giap would have loved to have Mr Swain nearby at nap time ........ :)   If you loved John Kerry's tired anti-Vietnam War fantasies, you will love Mr Swain's opiate dreams book immensely! 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who titled his review: "Mulisch, Pedant... writes a book."  Pedant seems the perfect term.  It is a collection of ideas that are thrown together, but not developed.  730 pages of time that I will never have back.  Not only was the book pretentious, it was also poorly written.  Perhaps the translation is to blame, as I read it in English.  Whatever the source, the (English) text was choppy, un-inventive, repetitive, and cliché.  Mulisch's overuse of similes is nauseating.  The dialogue was also suspect.  Instead of realistic, it seemed more the types of smart retort one thinks of only after an argument has concluded.  I'm at a loss as to what other reviewers see in this book.  Hopefully it works better in the original Danish.  Maybe it was just the wrong book at the wrong time for me, and I have missed the message.  However, now I am reading Orwell as a sort of antidote - and it feels a whole lot better.  I would suggest that you skip straight to that if you are looking for literature.  (Kidding about the Danish thing, by the way. 
 this book just reminds you how much better brian michael bendis' writing is. the series is so slow it could have been a one-shot instead of a 5-part series. although we do get the addition of the falcon to the ultimates' ranks (at least temporarily) and the debut of the ultimate vision, there is little else that's worthwhile. bendis' and millar's previously subtle characterization is shot to pieces here: the three x-men here are bratty and incredibly immature; the falcon is a pompous know-it-all; and captain america and fury are mere caricatures. skip this one 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 I hadnt' read a Johanna Lindsey novel in many years and now I remember why. I picked this one up at a local library and promptly returned it a day later.   Among other complaints is the fact that I really could not like this leading man. He was too selfish. Prime example...he snuck into the heroine's bed and divested her of her virginity while she was still asleep and half drunk because he "thought" that she was giving him come hither signals. He just said the equivalent of "oops". This was at a time when a woman's virginity was the key to the rest of her life....come on  Graduate up a few levels and read Tempted by Virginia Henley for a truly remarkable historical romance set in Scotland. You will love Black Ram Douglass and get a taste of historical romance fiction for the more mature palate 
 I love Rad's books and really wanted to love this one too.  It set up some interesting questions - Can lost love be regained?  Just who is Leslie Harris and in which world does she belong?  How can Leslie's high powered corporate shark life be understood by her low key, low tech parents?  Can you really go home again?  Well, unfortunately none of those questions get answered and we get a book full of the trite cliches of two people trying to overcome miscommunications and very easily surmountable obstacles with page after page of angst and hand wringing.    So dissappointing and so annoying when it could have been so much more.  And, in Rad's capable hands, it should have been.  If you want to read Radclyffe try Fated Love, Turn Back Time, or many of her other great books.  This one isn't one of her best 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan.  The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.    I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule.  The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times.  You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them.  I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete. 
 While I am glad that Ms. Olsen found the courage to speak out about the effects of severe child abuse, I found this book to be one woman's meandering tyraid against practically everyone and everything in her life, past and present.  It was difficult to follow and depressing...and I also have DID.  I did not find it the least bit inspiring or encouraging for fellow multiples.  Rather, I found it to be written in an almost self-pitying and egocentric manner. This very well could have been a message of personal testimony coupled with inspiration and encouragement.  However, the book is filled with one-sided rants that are very difficult to follow. If you are a multiple, do not look to this book for any hope or encouragement.  
 Unfortunately the version of JSF this was written against was using a different naming standard for the taglibs and there are a few other concepts that have changed.  Wish I would've bought a different book 
 This gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my Mark II body properly. 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 This movie was rather dissapointing to me. If you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one, it doesn't have too much action, except towards the end. The animation is also rather lacking and is rather  outdated, for instance, lots of time when one character is moving and  talking the rest of the screen is completely stil 
 Purchased as a gift to client. The gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was. But one of the cups was chipped. They could not find the chipped piece so we don't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not. Either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival. I'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client. Starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but I would choose another company to handle the gift baskets. Will not use them again 
 "Get Used to It" and "We won't stop" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music. Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music? How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!! 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 Even though the book is not very expensive through Amazon, it really doesn't have much to offer.  It's main purpose, in my opinion, is to introduce the reader to the products that Mercola sells through his website.  He may claim that he's only offering important health products to his readers, but he's making a lot of money selling these things (just check out the outrageous "shipping and handling" charges added to each order).  His newsletter is basically marketing for these products.  I hate to admit it, but I fell for one of his pitches regarding a chocolate bar that is actually good for you.  I paid over $40 for a dozen 2 ounce bars only to be told a couple of weeks later that they were contaminated with lead (some health food!).  It's now been over two weeks and I'm still trying to get the information from them on how to send this item back at their expense. Do yourself a favor and buy "Protein Power" or "Neanderthin" instead.  They are better books and they won't hit you with constant marketing to get you to buy their "healthy" products 
 Cheesy instructor the instructor's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize, the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves. the instructor is too fast to follow..to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone ..totally not professional 
 I used another version of this device in college and found that it worked well.  This product has not even phased the roaches in my house and to add insult to injury it makes an annoying ticking sound like a clock in every room of my house 
 I'm a big fan of bruce campbell but this movie really fell short. It wasn't funny at all 
 honestly, i tried to find something good to say about this vacumn cleaner. alas, i could not find a big enough positive that would offset all the negatives.the predominant minus is the heat factor, this unit gets way too hot! as with any size motor, overheating will drastically reduce the motor life. the hepa filter may be a good thing, but the constant cleaning of it is time consuming and messy.it is cheaply made, definitely not built to last very long. i could say more,but i believe the overheating aspect should convince most folks not to waste their time or money on this unit 
 Tompkins' book presents a view of literacy that does not reflect current thinking about the best ways to teach students important literacy skills.  Since you are probably purchasing this for a literacy methods class and have to buy it anyhow, I recommend you read this with healthy skepticism.  If you don't need to buy it, I wouldn't suggest it 
 The author states (p.330) regarding "Darwinism--adaptation brought about by natural selection": "Whether we like it or not, we are stuck with it. The Darwinian revolution is over, and Darwin won."  He goes on to say that any satisfactory response must hence be on Darwinian terms, "adaptation, selection, blind variation..." The last of these, also known as random mutation, is of course how according to Darwin live organisms obtain the form that allows them to survive. As I tried in other reviews here (and am dealing with fully in my own book), I am presently again trying to convey that this focus on the organism's form stems from a misguided analogy between humanly produced functional artifacts and the functionality of organisms. It was argued in defense of intention in the organism's form that just as man-made artifacts are in their functions produced intentionally by an intelligent designer, so must organisms in their functions be the intentional product of intelligence.  And the dispute is well known to be about whether or not organisms, too, were formed intentionally, by way of a goal-directed process.    The mistake is that the goal-directedness or its absence is looked for in the wrong area. While there may be difficulties in showing whether organismic forms came about by plan or by accident, there is no difficulty at all in seeing instead that it is the organism's activities that are indeed goal-directed. For this evidence of preponderant goal-directedness in the living--their aim of self-preservation--which stares us straight in the face, there appears to be a complete blind spot. On recognizing this, the consequence is that Darwinism, contending the same aimlessness in organisms as in other natural events, is false. Yet Darwin is doggedly followed in science and praised to high heaven, with the author of the now reviewed book calling him a genius (p.109). Let me accordingly comment briefly on how original is Darwin's thinking.  Inasmuch as natural selection is in essence the environment's influence on the organism, the influence occurring in any case, the main point of Darwin is that organisms become adapted to the environment by accident rather than by aim. And it is obvious that for any chance of that to happen, supposing it possible at all, there must be enormous multitudes of variations as claimed, the thought requiring no new idea.  The subsequent thinking then has had to be preoccupied with seeking explanations of how the wrongly hypothesized chance adaptations occur. 
 I may never read another book.  Never has it taken anyone so long to never arrive anywhere.  At one point I actually lost the will to live, not because I empathized with any of the characters but because I could not believe I had another 90 pages to endure.  I am so glad it's all over 
 The order was delivered promptly the price was fair, but the item was defective it did not work at all. The return process also was easy and I did get a prompt return of my money 
 I received this book for Christmas as I have been a devotee of the game for over 30 years. I have never been so disappointed in any present I have ever received.  This book serves as a reminder of everything that has gone wrong with the game.  Baseball was once the game of the common man.  A game of honesty integrity and spirit.  Reading this book reminded me that the important legacy items of the game are now in the hands of the superwealthy and can only be accessed by the interviews of another super wealthy man - Wong.  His sycophantic prose and painful rhetoric were difficult to stomach.  Do yourself and your kids a favor.  Save your money. Go outside and throw a ball around in your yard 
 I'm very disappointed in this book. When the mail came, I was excited. That soon changed. I have a couple of other bead embroidery books and was told that this was a great book. The price is high, the cover is beautiful and there are 7 glossy pages of color photos toward the back. Other than that, the rest is cheaply made. Illustrations are black and white line drawings and the work is simply regular embroidery stitches with beads, nothing new. The cover and the price made me believe I would learn something or get ideas. Wrong 
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment. Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do.  At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 I was disappointed with this book --it was much more simplistic than what I was looking for.  It seemed to carry a theme throughout: if your friend has problems, such as depression, unresolved childhood issues, etc., and they affect the friendship, it's best to end the friendship unless they go for therapy.  The author advocates making and keeping friendships that are described as fairly ideal.  That sounds great to me, but it just didn't seem very realistic, but rather black and white.   I found one story in the book particularly unsettling.  The author tells of one of her own college friendships.  Ms. Yager says that her friend, "Cindy," told her that she had tried to kill herself.  Ms. Yager speculates on her friends' upbringing and then says that at the time, she felt betrayed by Cindy's suicide attempt, "as if it were a slap in the face of our friendship."  Ms. Yaeger says, "Looking back, my thinking, however selfish and confused at the time, may not be all that atypical.  My first response was to wonder how much she cared about me as a friend if she was willing to cause me to suffer, as I would have if she had succeeded."   The author goes on to say that the friendship fell apart over the next year or two, and that she knew it wasn't due to the fact that they lived in different cities, as she had other friendships like that that worked.  She said the main reason was that Cindy's mental illness scared her. The author says that she has thought from time to time of trying to find Cindy to see if she got help and her life turned out okay -- but that she never has, and  that the reason she never has is because she has so many positive, healthy friendships now, and therefore she takes "the coward's way out" and does nothing.  What I thought was helpful about this story was that there are readers who might relate to how scary it is to learn that a friend is suicidal, and how problematic it can be.  But mostly I found some things about the story, as told, a little disturbing.  The author is a PhD Sociologist now -- not a layman about mental health issues.  I'm wondering why a professional is still a "coward" about this incident.  I also noticed that the author calls the many other friendship incidents in the book "betrayals," but when she relates her own story, she describes her behavior toward her friend as merely "insensitive" and says that she did what was probably typical.   In a great many of the other stories, the author analyzes what childhood problems may have led to the betraying actions in the friendships, but in her own story, she just leaves it at "I wonder what happened to Cindy?"  I'm not suggesting that the author must analyze her own reaction in this example from her life, but it strikes me as odd given the fact that she does so in so many of the other stories.   I also wonder why the author doesn't end her story about her suicidal friend by suggesting to readers how serious it is when a friend talks of suicide, and what basic things to do when that happens, without becoming enmeshed yourself - the author is a PhD Sociologist.   I found the book to be encouraging and validating in it's message of not letting destructive friendships go on and on and bring undue unhappiness and problems into your life, but it was too black and white for me, with too little insight into navigating through the problems.  To me, the author seems to be justifying her own unintentional betrayal of her friend, and that really gives me pause 
 Bought this set at Target 3 years ago for $200, and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them.  They're heavy, cooked things well, and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool.  Never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil (metal, etc) in them that didn't belong in them.  Took care when washing, didn't burn things in them, etc.  Somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months, and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement. Because I didn't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set, and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating, they had to go straight to the trash.  Very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life, with high care and high cost.  The 2nd star is because they are beautiful and I cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these, they might work for you.  For me, stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go.  I wouldn't even try another "non-stick finish" 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 Apart from Colin Firth's intense portrayal of the main character, this movie is really lacking any substance. At times it seems like it makes sense and there is a thin plot to grasp at, but then that too slips away.   As with most psychological thrillers, things are not what they seem. There are several twists in the plot, but most of them happen in the last 20 minutes of the movie, and ultimately the viewer is left completely confused, rather than shocked and intrigued.  Colin Firth's character wakes up from a week-long coma after a car accident in which he believes that his girlfriend died. He meets Mena Suvari, who helps him cope with his "trauma", and is for some reason attracted to him despite his erratic mannerisms and strange habits.  The filmmaking is also a little strange with quite a few slow-motion-esque shots. I wish I knew a better way to describe them. Strange shots where maybe the filmmaker is only showing every 5th frame, but in slow motion. It's distracting and not very aesthetically pleasing. There is, however, a very creepy dream sequence in the middle of the film that defintiely pays off.  The DVD has no extras at all, unless you count previews and subtitles 
 My daughter just about flipped when she received this toy as a birthday gift!  So immediately after the party, my husband went aboutputting it together.  My five year old played with this for all of about 30 seconds before a piece came off.  We've had it for about two weeks now, and EVERY time you touch this thing, some peice comes off.  No one plays with it.  It's just too much of a hassle to keep together.   My advice - but something else 
 In most of the articles Kun has written, he goes on about his upbringing as a "rich kid in LA." I keep reading in various articles the same nostalgic patter about bar mitzvahs and being into records as if no one else in the world was, and more about being rich and a "disaffected Jew". They are strangely the same autobiographical stories, told over and over and over again, and so mundane and boring you wonder what the fuss is about, and what he's so proud of with this, and why he thinks we should view them as anything beyond the dull world of an over-indulged child of priviledge. True to form, the book starts out with this AGAIN! After his usual first person ramble on the subject (the reason why is unclear.. since often it has nothing to do with the subject matter being covered), he then goes on--  rambles on-- about the subject of "American music" (I think) -- switching to a opaque academic "professorial" voice, veering into various declarations about "race."   His "opinions" on race-- particularly Mexican and African-American (I'm talking about the poor societies therein, not the priveledged tier)-- too often come across through a foggy lens, not by someone who has a clear vision of and experience with the issue (why he impresses the fact that he lives in a glass house and then tries to get us to believe that he "really gets" the world of ghettos and poverty is beyond me). His attitude toward the world of the new Jewish immigrant in America is often insulting and strange, particularly in the way he mocks this group. This, and other rants, only impresses the fact that a boy in an ivory tower attempting a hipper-than-thou stance has little true understanding of the subjects he writes about. Beyond this turn off, there are other problems. This is a very poorly constructed book, and very tiring. The subject matter is far above the tiresome presentation and the quality of writing. Wish someone else had tackled the subject, and by a more outstanding press (but perhaps it was turned down by the bigger houses) 
 Spong refuses to realize that God doesn't change, Scripture doesn't change, and therefore the Church shouldn't change.  To call the Church "anachronistic" for its attitudes on sexuality is to punt away the truth.  Granted, there have been abuses fo power by the church in many instances in areas such as these, and these are to be addressed and fixed, but to completely reevaluate, as Spong endorses, the Church's approach to how it stands in the face of modernity is to bow down to modernity as to an idol.  I hope and pray that Spong comes to a saving knowlege of Jesus Christ someday, and abandons the liberal nonsense that he worships in the place of the God he claims to serve 
   I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.   I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.   I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.   If you really want a good book read: "Making it to Westminster" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down 
 If I can't buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won't buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can't this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases 
 This is a typical J-Walk book with lots of padding eg. the complete history of Excel starting from version 1 plus lists, lists of lists etc. etc. Why would anyone want to spend 100's of hours learning all the complexities of VBA so as to be able to display a simple Message Box or reformat a range? Where is the incentive? Provide real, practical and useful examples as an inducement for people to make this sort of investment or you are merely writing to satisfy your own ego 
 I knew when I even saw the first show of this that this album/band would suck beyond belief, and now listening to this lame pop crap I was proven right.  AVOID. The guys vocals were passable on the show but they blow on this album  But again what did you expect look who's in the band..... 
 Easterbrooks book, while possessing an upbeat outlook on environmental matters, reveals all the hallmarks of a book written by someone with little insight and knowledge of environmental biology. As a scientist, I am  appalled by his fundamental lack of detailed references in support of his  perspectives, and inaccuracies which make this tome seem something akin to  a high school project. Of course, whether it is written this way  intentionally to appeal to the uninitiated or not is debatable. However,  there are dangers when someone as naive as Eastebrook dabbles into an area  of which he is neither qualified not informed. Altogether a rambling series  of prose with little substance 
 Faye, a successful young model, is about to marry Mark in a beautiful destination wedding.  Two of Mark's ex-girlfriends have been invited to the wedding as his friends, so Faye has unearthed two old boyfriends to invite along, and the whole band is staying in the hotel where the ceremony will be held.  In the twenty-four hours preceeding the ceremony, Faye must deal with Mark's jealous exes, her own unpredictable friends and past liasons, and Mark's disapproving brother - who happens to know of a past indiscretion that Faye doesn't want aired.  This book is an amusing romp, a British piece of chick-fluff.  The cast of characters is fairly broad: Faye's mother, Mark, and a few of the other characters are well-sketched through flashbacks as well as the main action of the book.  However, the main character, Faye, is unsympathetic.  The writing is inconsistent, funny and light in places, callow and dragging in others.  The beginning in particular is difficult to read, and some of the story is implausible.  However, the book is on the whole a not-unpleasant read 
 This book is an uninspiring analysis of Smith's work.  Nobody who has even a cursory knowledge of Smith's writings would be surprised by what Muller has to say.  The basic point that Smith was not a philosopher of unbridled greed is unsurprising.  It is not that the thesis of the book is wrong, but it is simply something that could have been said in an article or less.  Obviously a lot of hard work went into the book, but it is the product of a mediocre mind 
 I've had this toaster for a year now. If it weren't a gift, sent from out of town, I would have returned it along time ago. It barely toasts at all and now most of the functions do not work at all. The heating element above is dead so it won't broil and it only toasts one side of the bread. I am hunting around for a new toaster oven before this makes it to the trash heap. I hope there is one out there 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that's what you'll get when you buy this.  I say this because I've used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD:  Skin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up.  Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall's uniform (you'll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue.  Then look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green.  Evidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish.  As he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they're filled with blue.  At 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It's purple. That is not black.  On top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall's eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black.  I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release.  I plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, "proper" quality.  'Nuff said 
 Given the build up for this book, I found it very disappointing. It completely ignores the fact that most American companies have failed in China -- precisely following the strategies the author advocated!  If you know very little about China, and have eaten at a Chinese restaurant a couple of times, this book should provide an easy introduction.  Otherwise, pass on it!  I would much rather recommend "New Asian Emperors:  The Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages" by George T. Haley et al. for a more complex understanding of business culture in the region 
 i think the spiritual ideas here are silly and even condescending. a lot of importance is put on the purity and cleanness of the yoni, but it is like saying something is opposite of what it really is. if the yoni is so clean, why is it always the worst smelling part of my body? i'm not for promoting the idea to guys that us women are nasty, but this book is just to promote self esteem in women. my self esteem is fine, and if it ever needs help i'll go to the self help section of a bookstore and not another category entirely! i'm sorry i bought it, because it makes me feel gulliable, as if i'll automatically believe what i want, just because it makes me feel good. i am proud to be a woman and i don't need people telling me life is a bokay of roses.  please 
 In the introduction Mr Summers tells the reader that there has never been an unbiased and factual account of witchcraft.  He tries to pass his book off as being unbiased, when in fact he is using the exact same bias found in the 17th and 18th centuries.  He likens witchcraft to devil worship, likens to the pagan celebrations to sexual orgies and debauchery.  Like the rest of the fools of his day, he got it wrong.  Was there devil worship going on in his day?  Most certainly there was.  Fertility rituals for crops, healing the sick from natural medicines, and folk practices are not devil worship.  The bible describes Lucifer (i.e the devil, satan) as a beautiful angel.  The church, made by and run by man, created a foul image of the devil being half man and half beast, like many of the old pagan gods.  The accounts of witchcraft found in this book are twisted and perverted to fit into the scope of devil worship.  He makes hurdles of judgement, leaps to conclusions, and formulates opinions based on fiction.  He seems to be determined to make witchcraft out to be evil, in fact seems determined to make anything other than catholicism out to be evil.    Summers is a fool, just like his peers, and produced a "history" of witchcraft and demonology based on superstition and fear.  Why a man of god uses the tools of the devil is beyond my realm of understanding.  Don't waste your time reading this heap if you are interested in pre-christian religions.  Don't read this heap if you are interested in demons.  The only reason I would recommend reading this book is to see how christians view pagans and their religion.  This is as bad as it gets.   The sad thing is, some of Summers' other books are really quite good.  I read his books about vampires and werewolves about ten years ago, and rather enjoyed them.  It would be more accurate to call this book a "history of devil worship and demonology." 
 honestly, i hate my teacher for assinging this book to read. the plot is the most boring, stupid thing i have ever read! why on earth are people giving this book 5 stars?! IT DOESNT DESERVE EVEN ONE! i found myself loosing focus and daydreaming, ecspeacially during the end. this book was a drag. i'm glad my teacher only gave us two weeks to read it, that way i only had to skim those horrible pages 
 This component was returned because it was not compatible with my Dell all-in-one printer. I was not alerted to this possibility by any information from the manufacturer, from the supplier, or in print on the package. I should have been 
 This product is cheap all around. After finally getting the table together when we tried to get the chairs put together, the predrilled holes to help you made the wood split. It is not safe for a child. Looks very cute, but is very poor quality. Even the wood is scraps. You can see where they put two pieces together to make them long enough for the legs of the table. We returned this item and are still on the hunt for a set that we like and that is safe for the kids. 
 Mr. Chowdhury's writing is quite dry and I didn't get much out of reading this book.  I was quite disappointed after hearing so much from others 
 Hinky open/shut mechanism. It takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open. If it weren't so heavy, I would've returned it long ago 
 If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad; It covers much ground at a fast pace.  However, if you have read any of the other books out on CI (Fuld's CI Blue Monster, or even Michael Porter's On Competition) this book is rehashed material that is too elementary to gain any sort of knowledge to furtherer your CI knowledge base.  I commend the authors for a good start - but was hoping for much more detail 
 This book read like another attempt to re-write history by Paul McCartney.Too much innuendo and wanting of more historical fact 
 I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store. 
 I bought this thinking I was going to see some of the skits that made my laugh when I saw them on live TV. What I got instead was a DVD with only a few skits (that were not his best) and some out-takes. Very very dissapointing.   This should've been called "A few randome sketches pulled from SNL with Will Ferrell in them. 
 Hard to believe this book is worse than "One Arrow, One Life..."...Kushner actually did a better job at explaining Kyudo & Zen, but fell short in other areas-(see my review of that book if you wish). In "Zen in the Art of Archery"  Herrigel is searching to understand Kyudo, he doesn't get it for a very long time. Example, I loved this line from the book..."I pointed out to the Master that I was already in my fourth year and that my stay in Japan was limited". Now that's funny. So he stayed on another 2 years. The "Master" is constantly running circles around him, e.g.,...Herrigel..."And who or what is this "It"?....The Master..." Once you have understood that you will have no further need of me..." This is painful mind drivel to read. Save your money. 
 Pass on this one. Monticello itself takes a back seat to the Levy saga of buying the estate 
 I picked up this movie because I like Harrion Ford and I thought it might be funny. In my oppinon, watching it was a waste of time. The language was really bad, and Harrison's character had very low morals. There were a few funny parts, but nothing that stands out 
 The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring.  The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing.  The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other.  Not my idea of a good time 
 I recently moved back to Chicago and needed a map as a refresher.  I was very disappointed when I received this map.  It's great and handy, unfortunately it didn't cover the city.  The map didn't show Bucktown or anything West but included all of the Southside.  I was looking at moving into an area that I didn't have a map of!!! If you want to see any of Bucktown, Wickerpark or Logan Square do not buy this map 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 I'm a retail stockbroker/financial planner.  The material is almost completely useless for retail brokers and most financial planners.  The material would mainly be usable by fee-only financial planners catering to  extremely wealthy individuals and wishing to take the author's  "concierge" approach to servicing clients.  For most retail  brokers, insurance agents, and most financial planners, the book contains  little of use; don't waste your money on it 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 If this is the "best book out there on Charlotte Mason" and has "the most practical application" of her ideas, as other reviewers have stated, then I'd have to say that Charlotte Mason is confusing, because this is a badly written book.  I picked this up wanting to learn about Charlotte Mason's philosophy of education and what it looks like in the home school.  I returned the book with a bad taste in my mouth.  The author is VERY flighty, throwing out random ideas that are not well-explained or thorough.  Many of the chapters, including those entitled "Composition" "grammar," and "spelling," are only two pages long!  She randomly describes Mason's ideas for a scant paragraph, and then throws together some "How-To"'s that are bewildering.  After reading this book I can say that not only do I not understand Charlotte Mason, but I have little desire to because of this author's bad work.  This is NOT a book for those who aren't already Mason fans, nor for those who need detailed help in applying her philosophy 
 I firmly believe that Mr. Grisham should stick to fictional writing.  His attempt at Real Crime leaves so much to be desired.  Carlton Smith, Carlton Stowers, Diane Fanning and Keith Ablow do a much better job of Real Crime writing and in a lot less words and for a lot less money 
 A good cast wasted. Poorly written, filled with every cliche of "life on the edge", the film never gives depth to the three characters whose lives are so deeply intertwined. Their feelings for each other are never illuminated, so we don't know why they are together. They yell and fight and act outageously, but they give us no reason to care about them. For this I blame not the actors, but the director who seems to have no idea how real life happens or how real people talk to each other. Salma Hayek comes off the best, though her charcter is unrelentingly irritating. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as always, a very intelligent actor. Thomas Jane is pouty and intense, but has the least well-written character to work with. And why is the movie named after him, when the center of this drama is not Gary (Thomas Jane) but Valentino (Vincent D'Onofrio) 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 I am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects.  This was a Christmas gift and I was never so disappointed in the quality of this item.  It arrived with crayons broken and the ones that weren't, you couldn't even use on paper.  The markers are dry and caps don't stay on.  This is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous!!!  Definitely would be better off purchasing these items elsewhere!! 
 I agree with an earlier review of this book. Nothing new here! Although the layout of this "Dummies" book, follows in the basic outline of all in this series, that is about the extent of the helpful content. It is obvious that the author is organized - as she practically refers back to her own talent in that area frequently. She must not have anyone in her life close to her that is of a different thought process. Namely - the unorganized. I don't believe that she undersands our mindset one bit.  If you want real help, keep looking 
 First the sound quality is poor - I had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear.  Then there are the uncredited/unlisted "bonus tracks" - they are comercials/radio ads for Ike & Tina.  The version of "River Deep, Mountain High" is not the Phil Spector version. 
 This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my "go-to" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood, at any time. This CD has some well-written songs, but there are only two songs (the first, "Worms", and "Heartlandtruckstop") that burst out of the speakers the way Beth Orton songs can. The rest are all absolutely listenable but none of the songs has that "I must replay this song now" moment.   I am used to Beth's songs possessing many random moments of beauty, that are partly caused by the spareness of production. This CD all the songs sound pleasntly even on the EQ band, but they mostly lack the punchy lyrics or compelling music that grabs you. For instance, I heard many of these songs over and over again on the radio, but none stood out the way "Stolen Car" did or "Mt. Washington" did.  Get Daybreaker instead for your Beth Orton space in your record collection 
 Despite an interesting title and a beguiling title page, I honestly found nothing exceptional about Robin McKinley's collection of four fairytales. Whether her stories are original or retold, they are rather dull, predictable, and written with long-winded language that makes for sluggish reading. All are centred on the interactions between this world and that of Faerieland - or to be more specific, the interactions between young princesses and the inhabitants of Faerieland. None of these girls are individuals, instead they are cast straight from the princess stereotype and all the stories end on a slightly sickly-sweet note with each dilemma that the girls' face wrapped up in a nice little bow. Faerieland is not seen as a wild and elusive place, but as a pretty sparkling land with none of the depth or hidden meaning that fairytales are meant to have. They are sweet, pretty, *pointless* tales have nothing of the ambiguity or beauty that they could.  In "The Stolen Princess", McKinley tells the tale of one of the last kingdoms that border the realm of Faery, and the anxiety that the residents face concerning the possible stealing of their children. This happened to the Queen's twin sister Ellian, and now the same thing has happened to happen to their only child Linadel. The King and Queen take it upon themselves to rescue their daughter, whilst she herself awakens in the Faerie realm to greet its inhabitants. The pacing of the story is extremely slow, the "love-at-first-sight" scenario is entirely unconvincing, and the descriptions of Faerieland are unimaginative and flat - it sounds like quite a dull place actually.  "The Princess and the Frog" is a retelling of the princess who drops her golden ball and has it returned to her by a frog. Here, the Princess Rana is saved from the malevolent power of an unwelcome suitor's necklace by a talking frog. The ending is utterly preposterous: the frog returns to his human form, and challenges the suitor Aliyander - at this stage Rana runs out of the room, down to the pond, fills a flagon with its water and rushes back to dump the whole lot on Aliyander. Presumably, since no other explanation is given, we are meant to suppose that during this lengthy interlude of running and fetching water, the two foes simply stood looking at each other, since when Rana returns neither one of them has moved. Furthermore, how Rana knows that the pond-water will destroy Aliyander is completely unexplained, and therefore comes across as random and bizzare.  "The Hunting of the Hind" is possibly the only worthwhile read, which tells of Princess Korah, whose kingdom is plauged by the beauty of a golden hind, the very sight of which drives men into madness. When this terrible affliction lands upon her beloved brother, Korah herself goes out in search of the hind to learn its secrets. However, this story too comes to an annoying ending: the hind is under a spell, which can only be broken if a person goes to the wizard who placed the curse and asks him to remove it. But to prevent the wizard from using your inner emotions against you, one must enter his presence completely devoid of any feelings. So Korah leaves her inner emotions in the keeping of the transformed hind (err, how exactly?) and asks the wizard for her freedom. That's it. I was expecting some sort of twist, some sort of test or trick that the young girl must go through, but no - that's it. To top it off, McKinley throws in a brother to the golden hind to act as love-interest for Korah - why must every Princess land herself a hubby in the course of her adventures? Can't she just have the adventure for its own sake?  Lastly is the longest story, "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" which is told from the point of view of a middle-aged soldier, and is made all the better for it - by this stage I was thoroughly tired of McKinley's flat princess-heroines. The soldier takes up the challenge of solving the mystery of the twelve princesses, whose shoes appear each morning entirely worn out, as if they have been dancing all the night long. If you have read this old fairytale, then there is nothing here that will surprise you - McKinley tells the exact same story, except she takes twice as long to do it. There is a slight shadow of intrigue with the appearance of an old woman who aids the soldier, but it's not enough to warrant the energy I used in dragging myself through this story.  As you can see, this is a rather harsh review, and if you happen to be Robin McKinley reading this - no offence! McKinley is a gifted author, and I have enjoyed many of her books, but this collection just left me entirely unsatisfied. I've tried to give legitimate reasons as to why this is simply isn't a worthwhile book, without simply ranting at it, and the truth is that it just felt completely devoid of any real magic or passion. 
 There were a number of examples in this book where the authors seem to question the truth of God's word--1: "...it might be unwise to seek to reconstruct Israel's earliest history from the stories in Genesis..." (p63) 2: "Creation is described as taking place in six days...This is not a chronological account..."(p116) 3: "Noah's story: As with creation, we should approach this account as story..."(p122)  There were others I don't have the space to mention. I personally believe that Satan is using his first and greatest ploy within this book:  "Did God really say...?" (Gen 3:1)  It is subtle, but it does cause the reader to question God's Word. As long as I'm the librarian of my church, this book will not make it to the shelves 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off 
 I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.  In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature.  My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine.  Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.  Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one 
 This book was assigned school reading.  I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while.  Not recommended 
 This was a boring book. Nothing happened! The descriptions of people, places, and events were really good-unlike the plot. Basically, Thora is from some community where if you're born with the mark of the goddess, you learn how to use a limited amount of magic, and don't have to get married or take care of the home. The community is attacked by pirates, but Thora and her dog escape. Thora finds a wounded familiar, and they travel together. They find an underground storage chamber thing, and go through it. There are all sorts of things there from the old days, where technology was above that of the middle ages. Thora and Malkin and Kurt go to the place where Malkin's blood-bonded person is, they fight some evil people, blah, blah, blah. The thing I didn't like about this book was that nothing really interesting happens. They have battles, but the battles aren't realistic, even for a fantasy/science fiction story. I mean, they don't know who they're really fighting, none of the bad guys ever say anything. Plus, Thora is _really_ intolerant of other people's religious beliefs and  customs. If someone doesn't go with the code she was raised with, she pretty much gives them the cold shoulder. It got on my nerves. Again, nothing happened. I liked the furry people-the familiars, and their relatives in the woods-but the people were boring. Thora's is the only view point, and she never changes her mind about any of them. Basically, it's a boring book with boring characters. I've read a few of Norton's other books, and feel pretty confident when I say that this is definately not her best work 
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera 
  Nearly thirty years ago Saturday Night Live ran a hilarious TV commercial parody promoting "Puppy Uppers" and "Doggie Downers" to control a dog's behavior.  The reason it was so funny at the time is that it was totally absurd.  Nothing like that could ever happen, right?    Wrong.  Thanks to Nicholas Dodman and THE DOG WHO LOVED TOO MUCH it's now become a way of life for far too many American dogs and their owners.    Granted, when your dog is driving you crazy and you don't know what else to do, Prozac can seem like a godsend.  The only trouble is that nearly all of the behavioral problems Dr. Dodman encounters in the various chapters of this book could have been solved quite easily (okay, maybe "fairly" easily) with natural dog training techniques, which work not by desensitizing the dog to emotional triggers in the environment, but by resensualizing him, meaning by putting his instincts BACK INTO BALANCE with his environment.  (The only exception is a dog who exhibits OCD, as this is a definite neurological problem, not just a behavioral one.)  And another thing, in my fifteen years as a dog trainer in New York City, I've yet to see operant conditioning techniques, like the ones Dodman uses in this book, attain more than 15 to 20 percent effectiveness with any of the behavioral problems it's used on.  (This marked lack of success is, sadly, the main reason behaviorists are prescribing drugs more and more often.)  Dodman seems to have had even less than a 15% success ratio, though that could just be a result of his presenting the hardest cases to the reader in order to explain the necessity for these dogs to be put on psychotropic drugs.  And by the way, why do these drugs only work for about three months or so before the behavior re-presents itself or worsens?    And since Dodman (or his publishers) deliberately misused the word "love" in his title in order to sell more books, my last question is this: wouldn't it be great if Dodman loved dogs half as much as he loves drugs? 
 I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 This one is worse than "Don't Kiss Them Goodbye" in the aspect that I wish she would have included a LOT more readings and a lot less of her personal stuff.  
 I am a parent of a 3-year old.  The tapes were overall helpful in terms of parenting tips.  The information shared for strong willed children was a little too broad for my use.  It covered all ages, toddlers through high school.  I would like tapes that are specific to age groups as approach would change.  Buyers should be aware that the tapes have religious insertions all along the way.  
 As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia 
 I originally had to read this book for a History of Rock and Roll class at the University of Cincinatti. I found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful lectures. I had good expectations about this book going in, but those quickly soured as I read it.  It seems correct, at least, about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. Not that such is a particularly daunting feet.  However, it is rife with laughable fallacies. For instance, it calls David Bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era, metal. It futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all, such as the Carpenters.  I really had a good laugh when they called Bad Religion hardcore. Bad Religion is about as hardcore as Elvis is rap. Further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book.  I also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. For instance, it claims 'Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks is about domestic violence. Its about infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on.  The writing is also rather dry. Many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. It also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures.  After reading the book in completetion, I really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that I had thought were true. In the end, I felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything 
 Mark Furman cab be a brilliant detective but he is not a medical examiner. This is the same guy who almost imediately solved the OJ murder case while at the same time being shown to be a racist by his previous interview. One big plus and one big minus  resulting in a not guilty verdict. Mark has been shown to be a liability in anything involving ethics. He can add nothing to the Terry Schiavo story. 
 first, a disclaimer:  i actually liked the clinton presidency, even if i didn't care too much for the man himself.  and i think hillary was right when she spoke of the "vast  right-wing conspiracy," even though i thought she was cracked at the time.  so: all i can say about this book is that blumenthal appears to be assuming the same position monica lewinsky did.  this is a book written by a man with an astonishing ability to suppress the gag reflex.  he is a clinton worshipper.  imo, this is the book's major failing.  blumenthal can see no wrong where his friend and president is concerned; he spends pages upon pages justifying, praising, and illuminating the clinton legacy.  i could not read more than a chapter at a time -- a very unusual occurrence for me.  to be fair, the book does an excellent job of setting out the timeline of events that plagued clinton's presidency, as well as connecting the dots between certain right-wing actors and clinton's public approval ratings.  some of the anecdotes are amusing; some of the observations are insightful.  but that still didn't overcome my desire to wash my hands every time i put the book down 
 I was disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews others had submitted.  Carolyn touched on a wide range of topics briefly, and most of her advice would be applicable to people fresh out of school, as those who have already been working for a while would have encountered those situations and found a way to manage them by now 
 As a shaman myself I was appalled when I began reading this book only to discover that entheogens--THE VERY SOLE FOUNDATION FOR SHAMANISM ITSELF--are not mentioned once--not once.  Somehow this book is 600 pages of information about shamanism while not informing the reader of its actual basis.  What a blunder that this is supposed to be a definitive textbook on this religion and some poor people have read this book and considered themselves learned in shamanism.  It needs to be taken off the shelf 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 My 3yr son loves to sing and dance!  I loved the title of this cd and most of the artists. However i was disappointed when i actually listened to it.  There is really nothing upbeat about any part of this cd.  In my option, i think an adult would enjoy it more than a child.  Most of the songs are slow, which my 3yr old lost interest in very quickly!  I was looking for classic, fun, easy to sing and dance to music and this was just not it.   
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 I bought this as I am a Seattle resident (also 20s/30s female like the main character).  I thought it would be cool to find a book that combined the story of a woman's growth and a setting in Seattle.    Unfortunately, it's not a strong story.  The main character is shallow and self-absorbed, and the other characters aren't compelling- and this doesn't change over the course of the story.  The story revolves around the character's relationships to men and a couple of female characters (mainly her mother and her best friend)- not compelling alternative Seattle characters.  I really don't feel that this is a compelling story of human growth or broadening horizons 
 The title of this movie is a tad deceptive- it and the soundtrack are the only thing disco related to this soap opera of a movie that carries a script worthy of a "Sex and the City" episode. There are some, albeit very few, interesting plot twists. But basically this movie is mostly worthy of a late night movie made by and for Cinemax. Pity too. I'm a huge Chloe Sevigny fan (and not for "Brown Bunny" reasons), but her talent is minimally utilized, as is that of her co-stars. I realize this movie is largely about recent college grads and their pretentious entrance into the real world, with the disco night life as a back drop. But their trials and tribulations have little to do with the disco life itself. "The Club," the flick's disco night life place to be, is merely what Central Perk was to the TV show friends- a gathering place to gossip about relatively juvenile adventures in love (or reasonable facsimiles of), and their recent and up to now short durations in the working world. The minimal glances into "The Club" itself is archetypal. Were it not for an admittedly clever twist that explains a lot of the behavior of that disco's employees earlier in the movie, the dialogue would be largely mundane, uninspired and testing of the viewers patience. The pay off isn't rewarding enough to rescue one from that experience. Kate Beckinsdale's character is the stereotyical pain in the [...], nose in her friends' business nuisance, and she plays that well. But an annoying character does not a good movie make. And for a movie of this title, the dance scenes are minimal in quantity and display. Were it not for a friend letting me borrow his copy, I wouldn't have even dropped a single dollar to rent this flick. To be fair, the soundtrack is outstanding and solely keeps one following the movie's events. But that's hardly a reason to waste a couple hours watching this film's paint dry. You could probably buy the soundtrack and have a more entertaining experience 
 Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all 
 This book is writen by a series of authors. Each chapter is written by a single author, and each write about a single theme. However the chapters are too shallow. No good substance found for a serious person trying to write a good article that may be a good candidate for publishing. The autors are more interested in telling how good they are (in their own perspective) than willing to teach anyone about their supposed knowledge 
 I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive.  I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver. 
 I agree with Mr. Oshell on almost every point. I find John Calvin, in this writing, and in many others, confused about what he really believes.  He speaks of 'justification', 'sanctification', regeneration', 'grace', even 'faith', but cannot seem to come to an agreement with himself as to what these important terms mean.  After reading a good amount of the Institutes, I think John Calvin thought they all meant the same thing.  But of course, according to Calvinism, knowing about these things was ever meant for most of the world anyway, and knowledge of them doesn't make any difference to anyone's eternal destiny, so really, what does it matter who does or doesn't understand these terms?  The reader might find his eyes spinning in his head after a short while.  Much philosophy indeed....  John Calvin, like Calvinist writers in general, must of necessity give opposite meanings to the words of the living God in Scripture in order to teach what it is they believe, "Calvinism".  But I think any true 'believer' should be horrified by Calvin's notion that salvation and damnation of individuals are utterly left to chance, a decision already made by God for each of us before the foundation of the world, and most importantly, arbitrary in regard to "faith". God merely made the decision without any regard to His foreknowledge of a person's faith or lack of faith in Christ.  Unbelievable.  But this teaching comes from Calvin's belief that there IS no condition for salvation, that faith in Christ is not necessary for those 'elected' by God to salvation in eternity past.  God, they say, simply "gives the gift of faith" to the ones He has already elected to salvation (making them meet the apparent condition for salvation (faith) in John 3:16-18).  To hell with the rest, literally.    Is it any wonder that Calvinism has never enjoyed any peace in Christian circles?  The 'goodwill' of Calvinism's gospel is simply not meant to be goodwill to 'all'.  As for spiritual deception, Mormonism and the Watchtower Organization can't hold a candle to the brilliant deceptions of Calvinism.  Let me emphasize "BRILLIANT".  Calvin's Institutes turns truth on its head.  Just do as the Bereans did and never fail to compare what Calvin says in his Institutes with the word of God to see if they are in agreement.  What I found in Mr. Calvin's writings was 'the word of men' we read about in 1 Thes 2:13.  It is difficult for me to accept the fact that otherwise intelligent men would even 'want' to believe Calvin's horrible teachings. But its true, one's faith is a thing of the heart, and we can all believe whomever and whatever we want (I made the free will choice to reject John Calvin's teachings).      
 Great book on this classic strategy. Thorp got even richer using a similar system in the stock market. (Although it was during the bull years...)  Not suited for the less then occasional player or in general any player who's familiar with the game's rules in other languages.  
 I totally agree that we can feel conned this way.  I bought another book also with a different cover and ISBN but the contents are the SAME!  This is unacceptable. We who buy from the web will never have the chance to look at the contents before buying and we rely heavily on the cover and descriptions 
 I recently bought this DVD and was really looking forward to seeing it. Halfway I stopped watching it. Disappointing 
 The Lexar Media 2.0 cannot function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from Olympus. The help site explains how, with my Mac, I can reboot my computer in OS 9 Classic then, download the pictures, then reboot in OS X. Not a satisfactory solution. I felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase. I feel like I simply acquired electronic junk. There was no response from Lexar when I emailed support, which simply added to my feeling of being had 
  The sound quality on this video is absolutely horrid! Is sounds like it was recored off of someone's tape recorder in mono.  The musical arrangements are very outdated but it was interesting in seeing Tina earlier in her career to see how amazingly she has developed as a singer, dancer and performer since then. There were definite signs of her future greatness as a performer. But unless you are a Tina Turner fan nut, best save your money and buy some of her later videos 
 Like my title suggests,this album,I believe was the begining of the end for such a great,revolutionary metal group.Melvins practically invented a whole genre of metal - sludge metal,with many bands in this genre tipping their hats to them.Don't get me wrong - this album is not bad.But by early Melvin standards,Houdini is downright dissapointing.Those expecting the insane heaviness of the Ozma,Gluey Porch,Bullhead,ect.. period will have to look elsewhere.It's weird,some songs seem like holdovers from Bullhead(Nightgoat,Hag Me - one of their greatest,hardest songs) and other songs make no sense whatsoever (Sky Pup,Spread Eagle).You could sense the begining of the experimentation that they can't seem to stop now.I'm all for experimenting,some people feel they can't do the same thing all the time - but in the Melvin's case,if it ain't broke don't fix it.It's like they abandoned a genre they created.I've heard some of their later offerings,and let me tell you,don't bother-it's all pedestrian now.I hope Buzz is reading this - get back to your roots and make the sound that makes you feel like you are drowing in tar,slowly.PLEASE!(Update)5/4/06 - Okay, I admit I was a bit harsh in my previous review and I apologize. After more listens I now really appreciate this album.Yeah,it may not be as hard as previous offerings and yeah,it was their first major label release,but let me tell you this album is great.This album was better than most of the other music released during it's time,s*&t,its better than most of the music released now.I don't really know how to describe it-this is a crazy,loud,insane listen.And yes,there are other excellent songs apart from Nightgoat and Hag Me.Include the phsycotic opening track Hooch,the insane tranquility of Lizzy,the war cry Joan of Arc and ect.And one of the best tracks is Going Blind, a Kiss cover.The Melvins have actually done what I thought was impossible with me - because of this cover I actually got put on to some Kiss.Unbelievable!(The Melvins did an awesome cover God of Thunder also - you can find it on the internet.)Anyway,I give it 5 stars now in the present time.I still can't get into Sky Pup and it still is not as good as their previous albums,but the strength of the songs puts it to a 5.So disregard my old review,and Buzz,I'm sorry. 
 The Burn Journals, in my opinion, could have been written better. I mean, no one really needs to hear about someone having an erection. We want to know how he overcame his state of being and regained his dignity. That's why I gave this book a two. It was ok, but it needed more work. 
 And here I thought only Lindzen and Singer could write with such deliberate obfuscation in mind. Hooray for the status quo, let's do nothing until it is too late 
 I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman's guide.com. When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking. The black pair was dull and had no shine. Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes. All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned my lesson 
 Has American literature really come to this?  T.C. Boyle thinks that he is a latter day Swift.  No way.  He has merely created an unfunny cartoon 
 You can't judge a book by it's cover! That's for sure! When I saw the Teddy Bear Square on the COVER of this book, I decided to buy it. Well, I went all through the book, page by page and it is not there. That is fraud as far as I'm concerned.  I thought perhaps there was a missing page, but NO! No missing page, just no Teddy Bear Square. I think this is very deceptive. How can I trust the rest of this book??? 
     The reactionary authors of this book, as well as many of the reviewers on this page, apparently believe that there is nothing at all wrong with forcing their religious views on others.  They castigate the ACLU, probably the finest organization in America, for defending civil rights they would rather see stripped away.  The authors seize upon some sensationalistic, controversial cases the ACLU has defended, while ignoring the vast amount of good the ACLU has done for society.  Although the authors ignore the fact, the ACLU has defended both the left AND the right in many cases.  Ironically, if it ever came to pass, the ACLU would also certainly fight for the right of the authors to spread their lies through this book.      This book is written from a far right-wing viewpoint by people who want America to be a church-run theocracy, forcing all minorities to bend to the will of the religious majority.  Sorry, but that is the reason our forebearers fled to this country--to escape the religious persecution the authors and most of the reviewers on this page would like to force down the throats of the American people.  As the old saying goes, if you want a theocracy, go to Iran. The last time religion reigned was during the dark ages, when religious ignorance was more powerful than reason.  The authors would love to return our society to the dark ages.     The ACLU is a beacon of hope and freedom in these dark times.  Join today to protect your freedoms and fight the cowards who would strip them away. 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 Warner television should have discontinue this title after releasing Season 10 which they didn't. although this Item had been in sale for a long period on amazon.com, but buying this even for 6 dollars is totallt waste of money cause all the stuff are available on season 10! It could be worth if it was a real limited or collectors ediotion, packed with some extra stuff such as slip cover, collectible booklet, journal or something like that. but it was so far not a limited edition though. It had even no insert card! I can see this brilliant LIMITED EDITION! I think there is over a billion copies that they beg people to buy it in lowest price possible and still they have copies to sell 
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 The book wasn't bad, but I felt was did not include enough variety.  How about detail on putting up flagstone, or putting rock on an existing wood frame house wall...  Still an interesting book and includes some neat info 
 This is a breezy, poorly-written account that over-emphasizes SC's importance during the late stages of the war, at the expense of Naval affairs and the Yorktown campaign.  VERY little original research done for this book (if any) and author resorts to all sorts of fables and myths that have been debunked years ago. Advice: skip it. 
 I ordered this book, used it, and I had to return it. Imagine you work for big guidebook company (Foghorn Outdoors) and your boss gives you, say 3 months, to write an 800 page book with a stupid gimmick like it has "1000 Hikes of California"   You would write a book like this.   You would only have time to hike a tiny fraction of the hikes you're writing about. The majority of the write-ups on each hike won't contain any specific insights (beyond those lifted from other guide books), and most or all entries are flawed by: 1) no geographic features listed to guide you how to find and stay on specific trails; 2) GPS coordinates missing. 3) Usually NO listing of total or cumulative vertical feet of elevation gained/lost. 4) Mtns with multiple great approaches often have only one approach listed. 5) The maps are really no better than most state highway maps. There are basically no zoomed in maps of specific areas, showing trail paths. 6) this book is filled with BORING uninspired writing. It was written in "factory mode."  As a final example, could it really be possible this 800-page book omits a description of the one of CA's most classic test-of-will-and-strength hikes (10,500 ft of elevation gain!), the Cactus-to-Clouds hike of Mt. San Jacinto????  I suggest a look a Jerry Schad's books. He does a good job in getting you to the trailhead with the least amount of hassle. His descriptions are very accurate of trailheads, trail geographic features to help you find the trailhead and stay on the trail. These Schad guides are obviously written by a guy who has climbed the hikes he writes about!  As for me, I live in San Diego, and I love to hike in CA with my wife 
 WTF This C.D and the song that shares its namesake sucks. His vocals are crappy and often off-key, his voice cracks, and personally I wish I could gouge either my ears or his mouth out, possibly even both. This was the biggest waste of money ever and I hope the violinist goes insane and beats every single one of them to death.

 This book was obviously written at a time when most Conures were imported from the wild and not captive bred or handfed.  A large portion of this book deals with how to acclimate and taim a wild or unfriendly bird.  Furthermore this book is not a good companion for the Conure owner looking to find information on a particular species.  Many of the species covered in this book are not even avalible as pets or to be imported into the U.S.  When I finally came to the section on the bird I was interested in purchasing all I found were the physical characteristics with nothing about its general temperment as a pet.  This was hardly helpful as I knew exactly what the bird looked like but little else.  Another topic of no use to me was the detailed information on the breeding of Conures.  I am looking for a better source of information and would not reccommend this book to the average pet owner 
 I started watching this after Fever Pitch, which made me love baseball.  This "documentary" made me hate baseball.  Basically the show plays out like a monologue by Garrison Keillor, set to still photographs.  The history of baseball is not presented factually and dispassionately; instead the viewer gets it crammed down his brain that baseball is a great and noble game played by great and noble men.  This would be like watching a history of World War I and finding that it is narrated by a syrupy-voiced, American-as-the-apple-pie-you're-just-about-to-vomit narrator who starts, in Prairie-Home-Companion-esque manner, drumming it into you that the American soldiers, they were real fine fellers, but Johnny Boche... he was a bad sort.  Maybe Jimmy Stewart could be resuscitated just long enough to provide the American-till-you-puke aw shucks voice-overs and tell us that The American soldiers in the field were as right and true as the weather vane on top of the old barn back home in the yellow corn fields.  The yellow corn fields near the old swimmin' holler, where MaryJane McKlusky took off her red dress with the small white polkadots and danced around naked awhile to the soft sound of the whistle from the faraway train out of Coop's Junction.  
 This is the silliest thing I have ever seen. Once again the gorgeous Mr. Olivier follows the rule of If You Cant Do It Good Do It Loud. Look out whenever he has a speech more than two lines long! He will start out low and fast and get faster and louder and louder and louder until I think the other characters give in just so he will shut up. Olivier does this in every Shakespeare I have seen except As You Like It, which he must have made before someone told him the Secret of Playing Shakespeare above. Watching this movie is like visiting a tomb, and it proves the truth of the statement that the only good Shakespeare is contemporary Shakespeare. I am not even going to mention the costuming in the last scene, which anyone in mixed company or with children should be made keenly aware of before showing the entire preceeding play. 
 Get EE if you get these.  The D is very narrow and thefore uncomfortable 
 when i received my HD 515, I was excited, but after the initial test listen, I was not too happy.   overall speaking, the sound is good, but it's not good enough to worth almost 80 bux.   here is my detailed review:  1. high frequency response - good crisp sound, but it lacks detail and sound stage. the high notes sound "flat" and definitly not audiophile sound quality.   2. mid - good, but not great. the notes sounds sort of chopped up on mid-high frequencies. it lacks clarity and detail.   3. low frequency / bass response - the bass respons is not tight, and it sounds rather "loose." I tuned the low frequency (45 - 120) to +6 db for testing and the bass started to break up.   4. workmanship and build quality: i had the headphone for just a few weeks, and i found the connector is poorly constructed. the sound often go out in one ear, and if i jerk the cable, the sound will come back. the entire headphone is platic, and it doesn't look too durable.   bottom line. it's a good headphone, but i think i can get the same quality with a 40 dollar sony or JVC. this headphone in my opinion is over-priced and not so good sound quality.   not recommended.   
 After waiting a month to receive this item I am very dissapointed in its functionality. The spout is an inconvenient turn valve design as opposed to a push button. I could get over this if it were the only problem, but it is not. If you want to use the jar as a dispenser you will need to remove the gasket on the cover otherwise you will have a vacumn in the container, but even if you do this the flow is TERRIBLY slow and worse when the jar is nearly empty.  Looks nice though, might look good on a shelf with some pennies in it.  
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 I could not believe how elementary, basic and useless this book is. The only people I can think of that could make any use of this book at all are folks who do not have any etiquette skills and barely know what an email is. This book makes such earth shattering suggestions as not to write threatening emails or emails about insider information. Wow, there's something I'm glad I read about. Also, A large section of the book is spent explaining what the difference between CC: and To: is. Long discussions ensue on explaining both CC: and To:. I bought this book expecting a wealth of material on emailing for the average person and have instead found not one paragraph of useful information. For the first time I am returning a book to Amazon. Dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Even sixth graders are too advanced for this book's contents. I sorely wish I could give less than one star- this book has my complete disdain 
 I have read hundreds of diet books--but honestly this one is the WORST one EVER!!!  It was so depressing that I had to quit reading it!!! REALLY!!!  I ordered "THE OVERFED HEAD" by Rob Stevens at the same time and it was THE BEST DIET BOOK I've ever read!!! -- thanks to Rob -- it may be the LAST DIET BOOK I'LL EVER READ!!!  Take my advise and buy his book -- he gives great advise!!!  Rob was on a diet for 25 years, but when he STOPPED DIETING -- he lost 150 lbs!!! -- proving diets don't work!!!  The only thing you LOSE on a diet is the money you spent on the diet!!! -- because the weight always comes back -- plus more!!!  Mary   
 This book claims that it caters for beginners.  I don't think so! It's only of any good to those that are already familiar with programming or another programming language.  The language used  is arcane at times that only people with previous programming knowledge would understand and benefit from this book.  Its exercises are also pointless since there are no answers given.  I recommend C by example for beginners which assumes nothing.  Its excellent book for beginners 
 The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book.  The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty.  Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi.  Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth.  While new to the subject, I have already found two better books.  Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi  Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 The book is readable.  The pacing is pretty good.  Some of the scenes are pretty good.  The basic plot:  Dr. Victor Frank is a fertility and genetics genius and leads a world-class fertility and research company.  He and his wife decide to use in vitro fertilization to have a second child.  Dr. Frank is unable to restrain himself from tinkering with the embryo's genetic makeup and developmental schedule.  His secret experimentation results in a super-intelligent son, VJ.  Unfortunately, VJ's super intelligence comes with a complete amorality and pandemonium ensues.  Heavy-handed allusions, too-obvious foreshadowing, and a conclusion that is projected from chapter one are all problems.  There are plot holes you could drive a truck through.  Characterization is extremely simple, character development is non-existent, and the plot twists are too simple and obvious to be very enjoyable.  The basic premise of a super-intelligent amoral murdering drug-lord is not that original.  Now make him three years old when he kicks off his murdering spree by offing his own brother and, well, let's just say that it's not particularly credible.  By the time he's five he's bio-engineering lethal and infectious cancers in a genetics lab he assembled from stolen equipment?  I'm just not buying it.  Although the science and medicine are explained pretty well, they're just not used in a credible way.  Final analysis:  There are many better things to read 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Bought this book because there was a good feedback. But when I tried 3 times of 2 recipes and it didn't work, I gladly exchanged for something else. Wrong measurements were given which resulted in me wasting my expensive cocoa ingredients. Waste of time and money 
 Sybex normally has a reputation of being THE book to study to prepare for your exam of choice.  Unfortunately this one falls well below of my expectations.  I've been in the IT industry for a few years now, and even I found this book to be a difficult read.  Many times, the elements presented dont follow a logical sequence, making it necessary to flip back and forth among chapters to gain the proper perspective.  This book often calls reference to items you'll learn in future chapters, which can be confusing when the authors throw acronyms at you that you dont understand.    Also, I find the review questions in this book rely solely on your memorization of the material studied, but not on APPLYING that knowledge to a real-life scenario, which is really what you will be tested on (applied knowledge).  The review CD that comes with the book is equally uneffective.  It does have a feature where you can re-review all the end-of-chapter questions, along with a "flash card" program of about 300 fill in the blank, and true/false questions, but again; these are strictly memorization, and doesnt really help when presented with a problem thats not in the book.    After finishing the 70-271 section, and answering all the book questions, I downloaded another test resource and was blown away with how much I still did not know.  I really cannot recommend this book, I really should start reading reviews before I blow 60 bucks.  Try the Microsoft Press books, they're more expensive, but well worth it.  At least you'll walk away with a feeling of actually being prepared for the test.  But of course, these are just my thoughts.  Good luck to all the techies in getting your certs 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 The delivery took about as long as anticipated but ended up being the wrong edition of the book... Good thing I didn't spend too much for it 
 I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico.  If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life, pick up a book by a respected latin author, not this joker.  I found it disturbing, but not because of some profound events in the storyline, but rather because of the mental condition of the author, whom I found rather perverse. 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 This has got to be the most dumbed-down version of Faust I have ever come across.  Where as any good english translation reads like poetry that tells a story this version reads like two guys in a coffee shop having a conversation.  Honestly all the beauty of words that Goethe spent so much effort putting to perfection is dumbed down to such a layman level that a lot of the effect of his genius is lost in this version.  I was terribly dissappointed with this version when I got it.  Don't buy this translation unless you have no ability whatsoever to understand poetic language.  
 I got very excited when I first reviewed the front cover of the CD, and the titles of the songs included. I thought this is pretty comprehensive list of my favourite songs and artists from the 80s. I did not hesitate to buy it right away. Even was patient as the order was delayed a couple of times due to unavailability. When I got the CD I broke the seal and put it right into my car stereo. I was very disappointed very soon. The first song to surprise me was Loretta Goggi's Maledetta Primavera which was sung by a Lorena Poggi (Notice the similarity in the name). The second one was Per Elisa which was not sung by the original singer Alice but by some singer named Nives. The third one was Storie di tutti giorni, a himn of the eighties, but not sung by the "grande" Riccardo Fogli, but by some Riccardo Forte (notice the similarity in the name, by now I am thinking it was no coincidence). The rest of the disappointments list is long but here is the main ones:  - Viva la mamma - how can someone but Eduardo Bennato sing that song - Addesso tu - I do not think this Mirko Guida comes even close to replacing Ramazzotti's performance - Non Succedera piu - I am dissapointed to see someone else sing Claudia Mori's part, but I can not accept some ammateur replacing the great Celentano. I think I was duped by the type of advertisement of the CD. On the positive note, there are a few nice songs with the original artsts such as Vasco Rossi, Matia Bazar, Nino D'Angelo, Toto Cutugno etc. that is why I give it one star. If you are a connoisseur of any level of Italian hits of the 80s, this album is not for you 
 As a book that details the origins, history and,(to a point), beliefs of Witnesses, this is an interesting book. It is also a highly polemical book and it is that polemic that worries me...fiercely. I am not a Witness, have no desire to become one, either. While religious beliefs of all flavors have always fascinated me, I have been equally dismayed by their irrationality and oft-times silliness. Religion has given us much  beauty, such as Chartres Cathedral. It has also given us much horror, such as Heaven's Gate. But that's my opinion; that and a buck-twenty five will buy you a cup of coffee. The United States was founded, in part, by men and women whose religious/political beliefs were no more or less wacky than those of Witnesses. They fled Europe, and Elsewhere, to come to a place where they could live as they choose, believe as they choose, raise their children  as they choose and BE LEFT ALONE. I am all for the spread of Reason and the defeat of Ignorance...but by whose definition? And what gives them the right to decide what is "Reasonable" and what is "Irrational"? The health of a Tolerant Democracy can be measured by the way we treat groups like the Witnesses; and the more unpopular the group, the more neccesary our tolerance. The author William S.Burroughs once lamented that we have become "a nation of finks, where no one is allowed to mind their own business." Don't like Witness Theology? Then don't become a Witness. But don't limit the freedom of those who are Witnesses, however silly and sad their beliefs may seem to you. If the Torches are ever lit, count me out.. 
 Instead of providing extensive hitting advice from players past and present as advertised, this book actually concentrates almost solely on the advice of modern instructors. NOBODY before Ted Williams is quoted  extensively. The advice of some of baseball's greatest hitters (Ty Cobb,  Tris Speaker, Rogers Hornsby, etc.) is condescendingly limited to a line or  two of very general comments. Louisville Slugger could've reprinted the  article "The Science of Batting" that Ty Cobb wrote for their  1944 "Famous Sluggers Yearbook," [reprinted in "Ty Cobb: His  Tumultuous Life and Times," by Richard Bak (1994)] but they don't.  This is largely due to the fact that early 20th century batting techniques  are now considered by so-called experts (like Mike Schmidt) to be primitive  and obsolete (a biased and incorrect belief). As evidence of their blind  prejudice, page 107 shows complete lack of research. To depict Ty Cobb's  hitting style to be obsolete, they explain that the reason he could still  hit .367 with his "primitive" style was because  "...outfielders played DEEPER in those days because THERE WERE NO  FENCES. Thus, the gaps for Cobb to slap or punch the ball into were large  and many..." (emphasis mine.) THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN  THAT MAKES THIS LUDICROUS CLAIM. The fenced-in ballpark was actually  introduced in 1862, 24 years before Cobb was born!!! The book "Green  Cathedrals" by Philip J. Lowry (among thousands of others) proves the  presence of fences in Cobb's day. Similarly, thousands of old photographs,  many reprinted in baseball history books, prove that outfielders played  MUCH SHALLOWER then, too. Now, how can you respect--let alone trust--a book  that makes claims like THAT??!! 
 I built a new house and set up a computer network.  I purchased the Linksys BEFSR81 8-port router V3 and when I connected it I was only able to get a 56 kps connection.  The firmware upgrade failed.  I spent hours on the phone with their support to no avail.  I hooked my old Linksys 4-port router up and I got 3350 kps speed to every computer I had connected.  I returned it to Radio Shack where I purchased it and they replaced it.  The new one came and I got the same result.  Linksys asked me to return it to them directly and they would replace it.  I did and the one I got from them was the worst of all.  It only got a 33 kps connection.  The one Linksys sent me had no UPC code so I was unable to return it and they would not return my calls.  I wrote to the CEO at Linksys and received no reply.  Radio Shack finally allowed me to return it for a refund.  I am disappointed with Linksys's attitude on this matter.  I decided to use my 4-port router with a 8-port switch and I received outstanding results to all of my machines without any problems.  I would not receommend this product, or returning anything to Linksys.  Get a refund if it doesn't work.   
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 We have NOT received this item yet. Please let me know the current status 
 If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one 
 I was pleased with the orginal edition of The Secret World of 007 and felt this was worth getting for the updates. But to say this book has been updated with Die Another Day "and Casino Royale" is deceptive. The Die Another Day section is nice and complete, but the Casino Royale section is only 2 pages and not even presented in the same style as the other sections -- no "mission to Madagascar" or anything. Just a large pic of Craig and the Aston Martin spread across both pages and the film title (and a few smaller pics -- all of which we've seen). I was expecting cutaways of the casino and Venice house, etc. Nothing. So this book is updated with Die Another Day. That's all. Factor this into your decision to buy 
 Lev Manovich claims to have been trained in computer science. If he had any respect for the field, he would not have filled his book with deliberate misstatements about the nature of digital media. He uses these misstatements to fill out his narrative about the development of new media, and in doing so misinforms the "new media artists" he purports to educate.  The writing is reflective of Manovich's speaking/lecturing style: factually lazy, fluffed up with pointlessly obtuse language, and above all else BORING.   If you are an artist looking to understand the development of new media, look elsewhere, as you will only be bored and misinformed by Manovich. If you are a computer scientist looking for media theory, you will also be bored, but also possibly offended by the lazy treatment of your area of expertise 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 This is a great idea, but the execution is very poor. The journal has different sections for you to list what books you want to read, favorite passages and more. But unfortunately every page is identical with a T-chart-like format, which gives you little space to write. For instance, if you're to write a favorite passage, the space to write the title of the book is the same width as the space allowed for the passage. Are you supposed to abbreviate? Or only include passages that are four words long? The journal doesnt include plain, lined or blank pages, so it's really only to keep track of books and book passages. The cover is the only good thing good about this journal 
 This book is nothing but a shameful and disguised attempt (notwithstanding his denials) to discredit Democratic voters and to advocate the enactment of "election reform" laws that will disenfranchise voters, while at the same time ignore and dismiss the greatest threat to our democracy today - the privatization of our elections with corporate owned electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software and leave no paper trail for auditing them.  To be more specific:  The book is filled with purported examples of illegal voters, ignoring the fact that this problem accounts for a small minority of election fraud in our country today.  To remedy this problem, Fund advocates several measures that will do little to remedy the problem, while disenfranchising millions of voters, mostly those who are poor or non-white and most likely to vote Democratic.  Here are just three examples, among the many cited in Funds book: 1) Disallowing homeless people to vote because they don't have a proper address; 2) Requiring a picture ID to vote - which 10% of the population lack, and which amounts to a poll tax for the poor; 3) Abolishing the extending of voting hours in situations where insufficient allocation of voting machines results in as long as 10 hour waits to vote (again, this is a problem faced mainly in poor and minority neighborhoods).     But whereas Fund is so concerned that an occasional illegal voter may slip through the cracks in our system, when it comes to electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software, although admitting that mistakes are sometimes made, he claims that these machines cannot be used to steal elections.  To prove this point he does nothing more than quote a man who works as a PR consultant for Diebold - although Fund is Careful not to mention this fact.      
 The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.  In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...  I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.  This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!  Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.  Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
 It is obvious that they have a lot of talent.  The first song has a lot of energy and is quite good.  But after that, the tempo of all the songs is moderato at the fastest.  Most of the songs that were chosen were just to slow of songs.  It does not match up to the caliber of Bond, where I thought it would have 
 This book would only be tolerable if you like romance novels, but in that case you'd be better off buying "The Notebook". - This book has no practical business value at all. I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents "facts", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of `inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction. No 
 The characters are unbelievable and lack any development or depth.  Everyone is superficial.  Everybody just "happens" to tell Bel everything they know, so untrue to real life I couldn't finish it.  Great reading for 12 year olds, but I'll  choose  Adam Dagliesh and J. P. Beaumont any day.  
 I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?   Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen 
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 What a shame that a better work has not "followed" in the footsteps of Highsmith's first three Ripley novels. While the setup is intriguing and has great potential, the entire premise is marred by poor pacing; do we really need to have page after page of (what amounts to) a Berlin travelogue, as Tom Ripley and Frank visit the zoo...and then have a light lunch....and then go for a drive...and then take a walk in the forest. The kidnapping is the most engaging section of the novel - what a pity that it takes nearly half the book to even reach it. Though some may find Frank Pierson an interesting character, I was soon disappointed to see that he was reduced to a maudlin mass of ennui. There is nothing exciting or dramatic (or even interesting, for that matter) in a character who essentially "mopes" his way through the entire novel, brooding on the boorish notion that his girlfriend has gone off with another boy because he has travelled to France. Of all the Ripley books, this was the one I had the highest hopes for, and I was sorely disappointed; read it if you intend on reading all of them, but know that it's a flawed work at best 
 I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it. 
 Apparently the authors don't know the strength of the word bible. If this book is a bible, then I hope that I'll never find it in the drawer of a hotel bed-side table. Absurd information about nutrition. Someone should  tell the people from Gold's to start from the beginning instead of writing  books for their, already huge, friends. If you're a beginner, don't join  the gold's religion; find another bible that's realist 
 La produccion de este dvd es merecedora de un despido por parte de la disquera responsable. Es una pena que esta maravilla de concierto no haya tenido una revision antes de su produccion pues, como mencionaba alguien en su review, el sonido y la imagen estan completamente disparejos.  La musica es excelente, las imagenes memorables, pero como dvd musical deja mucho que desear ese defecto en produccion.  Una mala imagen para la que fue sin duda alguna la mejor banda de rock en espanol...y el mejor concierto 
 Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer 
 Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well.   Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!  I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.  Cool book title though!  
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 I had read the original book a lot and found it pretty good. I bought this based on that fact. Sorry to say I was not pleased. trying to texture from the info in this book is pretty useless, heres an example: "Assuming you already have your image data loaded into memory..." It doesnt tell you how to do this! It says how to create an openGL bitmap, but not an image like a windows bitmap. There is then like 3 pages on loading a TGA file but its too much of a weak introduction. Example: "For space reasons, we are not going to show you the code for this class here (look on the CD!). I bought a book to read, the CD doesnt explain the rest of the class. There is a big difference in manipulating the code and understanding it.  Summary: The older book is better and has more information 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.  Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring: 1. Added more suspenseful climaxes 2. Taken out unimportant information 3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format 4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book 
 I bought this book by accident when I was looking for a different book, also called Playful Parenting.  This one was hard to follow, confusing, and a rehash of old tired ideas 
 Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon 
 If by some mischance this were the first Naipaul novel you ever read, I doubt you'd read another. Not that it's an empty book or a stupid book! It's just not a well-crafted novel. The early novels, like The Suffrage of Elvira and Miguel Street, were exuberantly funny and picturesque. The later novel, like Bend in the River and Guerrillas, were powerful depictions of the sicknesses of our times. In between came A House for Mr. Biswas, surely one of the greatest novels of the century, in a sense the last Victorian novel that could justifiably be written. Following Guerrillas, it seemed that Naipaul's analytic mind thoroughly displace his imagination, and the best of his later books are all "non-fiction", often in the form of extended travel essays. A gentle introduction to the ferocity of Naipaul's world-view would be A Turn in the South, his only book about the USA. Perhaps he should never have returned to the novel, the craft of which I think he no longer enjoys. Be that as it may, Naipaul is one of the greatest English writers of the century, more than deserving of the recognition of the Nobel Prize 
 Professor Lee's disdain for rigorous analysis, explicitly stated in numerous places in this book, sets a poor example for his students and the engineering community.   On p. 72 we see the most explicit statement of this attitude: "The fussy reader will note that, strictly speaking, the integral is improper. We don't worry about such minor details; we're engineers. Thus, the integral of sine is cosine and that's that."   In this particular case, the result obtained is correct, so Dr. Lee's neglect of rigor hasn't resulted in an error. It demonstrates an attitude, however, that is inimical to the competent practice of engineering, in which rigorous mathematical analysis plays a very significant role. When rigor is discarded, the results will be correct some of the time, but they will also be incorrect some of the time.  An example where the lack of rigor I described leads to an incorrect result can be found in another of Dr. Lee's publications [1]. Here the authors observe that for a certain feedback system with two loops, one of the error signals has the form e=X/(1+H(s)), which looks a lot like the error signal for a single loop, e=X/(1+T(s)). The authors conclude that H(s) must be an "effective loop transmission" describing the stability of the two loop system, which a more rigorous analysis shows to be incorrect.  While intuition and rules of thumb are certainly useful in engineering, Dr. Lee makes a fetish of these shortcuts. His style lacks the rigor that one would expect from a engineering textbook, and then adds insult to injury by making the bizarre claim that the rigor is unnecessary.   [1] "Automatic phase alignment for a fully integrated Cartesian feedback power amplifier system", Dawson, J.L., Lee, T.H., Solid-State Circuits, IEEE Journal of, Volume 38,  Issue 12,  Dec 2003 Page(s):2269 - 2279. 
 I read the amazon reader reviews before I bought the book. Yet I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the purchase. The principles in the book about dream making is nothing new at all. The book tries to relate a  concept of 'ease' with a life working towards your dream. But it is not  very convincing to me. And the 5-step process on finding your dream is a  typical method that can be found in many other self-help books 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 I have an eclectic taste in my reading material and I was hoping this book would present a neat atmospheric tableau upon which the author spun her "facts" about this topic, but I didn't find much that was impressive, cool, informative, or even suitably moody about Solitary Witch. In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up 
 If you're looking for a book that will give you practical, nuts and bolts, down to brass tacks advice on how to make a quality, professional looking DV movie on an ultra-low budget then "Digital Moviemaking" by Scott Billups is NOT the book you're looking for. This book was obviously written by a tech-nerd for other tech-nerds.  The majority of this book is technical information and history and should instead be entitled:"Hi-Definition Video Moviemaking" as this is what Billups spends the majority of the book discussing. There is precious little in this book that a low-budget filmmaker will find of use. Billups and co. are apparently of the opinion that it's a waste of time shooting on anything other than HD video or 35mm film and seem to have nothing but contempt for Independent, low-budget filmmakers.  If you are an aspiring filmmaker who has a good movie idea and want to know how to shoot it on an ultra-low budget then don't waste your money buying this book. I recommend instead reading "Digital Filmmaking 101" by Dale Newton and John Gaspard which is a much better book that explains in layman's terms how to shoot a quality, professional looking movie on digital video. It was written by 2 guys who have made good low-budget films and have a lot more respect for and understanding of independent, low-budget filmmakers than Scott Billups. 
 I think this book must be able to hit someone well. I think if your just starting out, Christian and sort of interested in unschooling this might be a good book for you. Unfortunatly for me I have been homeschooling awhile and found this book a waste of my time. I don't like how they tell you to be wary of curriculum companies and people trying to sell you things but in the next sentence they are pushing "their way" on you. A little two faced for me. But I did walk away with some good information so it wasn't a total waste. I have read worse books on homeschooling that is for sure 
 To understand intelligent design you have to understand the political and psychological position that the United States is at.   "Intelligent Design" and "Christian Science" are concepts needed to create the Orwellian Society that the US establishment needs to propagate their position as a superpower.  Guys, open your eyes, you're being lied to.   How come you're the only ones not seeing it 
 This book was not very good.  It doesn't give enough solutions to behavior problems 
 I couldn't decide whether to buy this book and so ordered through my local library.  Wise choice.  This is not really a full-length study but rather an expanded article/essay that falls apart after the first third.  Repetitive, reductive and sounds like an extended PhD dissertation.  A real disappointment.  Needed a good editor (like get rid of some of the unnecessary 'sics' and the repetition that borders on perseveration) 
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 I never received this product and will not order from you again. When there is a problem, you are not easy to reach 
 The Southwest Airlines Way offers little applicable business process knowledge.  Instead the author provides a steady diet of amibiguities and generic case studies.  Drucker this is not.  I was particularly interested in the relationship between unions and Southwest management.  What I expected was a discussion on the management side of the economic value added of union involvement and on the rank-and-file side a discussion of the reasons unions were needed in lieu of employee empowerment programs.  What you get is "we're all in this together".  I recommend this only for those readers who know little about the airline's history and seek a basic primer.  Buy it used 
 The filters fit and do what they are designed to do, thought a little costly for what you get.  Unfortunately, the MyPod that they fit just doesn't do anything but make a colored water drink that doesn't come close to EcoPod or the standard pods for the coffee machine 
 Well....      I'm not happy with :(   The DVD's are cool indeed but the so cald H3D Viewing system   i don't like, why ?!   Sure i can see depth, sure i can see 3D with it,   But, NOT like in the pictures on the H3D Viewing System Box, nothing comes out of my TV or the so cald  come-off-the-screen effect, that's for sure...   And it's NOT that i plugged it wrong ! Or... i have bad eyes : 
 I needed to know more about Sarbanes-Oxley for work and ordered this book.  While I was waiting for it to arrive, I went onto the Internet and downloaded some information, including the text of the legislation itself.  I read through the legislation.  I'm not an attorney, and I wasn't motivated to cross reference the other laws/acts mentioned.  In other words I just read the legislation as is, with no legal background.  When this book arrived, I expected it would provide information and/or interpretations that I was not able to get directly from reading the legislation and other free materials.    In truth, I found there was very little, if anything that I hadn't gathered directly from my other sources.  If you are trying to learn what Sarbanes-Oxley is about and choose not to use the available information, this book does describe the basics.    I would not recommend it, because it does not significant add to, or simplify the information readily available for free 
 This book was not good at all. It didn't thrill me whatsoever. It wasn't amazingly clever or even that interesting. I'm sorry I even read it 
 Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.   However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.    For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.  Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.   
 Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH 
 First of all  A. Packs are idiots disguised for money. B. this is no goody, the two movies are bad.  The cat says "Son of b*****" in this movie. something everyone should know is this is bad 
 Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months.  The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights.  Poor product Netgear 
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 Adobe should be absolutely ashamed for actually releasing such a piece of literary garbage. This book will definitely teach you some decent basics of PPro if you have a good tolerance for mistakes and don't mind spending a significant amount of time trying to reverse engineer things to try and figure out what the book 'MEANT' to say. One can look past a couple mistakes or typos, maybe even expect them, but I was utterly shocked at the sheer number of mistakes contained within this publication, it defies believe.  I read reviews before paying full retail price at a local bookstore, so I had an idea what I was getting into and what to expect, but I figured, "Hey... how bad can it really be?" and chose to give it a try anyway with my expectations adjusted. Just for the heck of it, I started out keeping track of the number of mistakes I came across... I finally gave up trying to count them by page 175 (out of 505 total pages). I would be completely shocked to discover some editor or proof readers were NOT fired for giving the green light to release this book. My advice is do not waste your money on this book, choose another publication.  Mirt 
 It's a long, boring book about some old dirt farmer out in bumf&*k, Nebraska beating his wife and having kids he doesn't love.  The end 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 The movie is an attempt to talk about Krafft-Ebing work to understand and classify human sexuality confined as he was by Victorian morality and science.  The problem is that it attempts to focus on at least five different cases, sometimes skipping between one and another.  The result is that I could not feel much of anything for any of the stories except that of the young woman and her governess who are lesbians.  I was amused by the ending which demonstrates that even the "best therapy" may not be a cure for what society considers sexual problems.  Regardless of the warnings the movies feels the need to have, it is not very sexual explicit nor did I find it particularly arousing.  I also didn't think "Victorians are weird" but instead "Victorians were sad" but I knew that before from working with the ideas and erotica from that period 
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 Jet lee was dorky in this film, and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad. This film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in America. After seeing the light, Jet returned to Hong Kong and completed the historical Once Upon a Time in China series. The rest is history 
 I read this book with high hopes, as it seems to have been highly regarded by many who have dealt with autism.  However, I was quite disappointed by it, on several levels.  The depiction of Daniel's autism is very textbook---I got very little sense of him as an actual little boy.  He followed the book on autism too exactly---right down to obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine.  The methods that helped him, which although this isn't spelled out seemed to be a modified form of Floor Time, were not really convincing to me.  This book failed most for me as a novel, though, not as an autism portrait.  The characters never came to live for me in any way.  Melanie's estranged husband, Stephen, comes across as such a cold fish that it's impossible to understand why anyone would have fallen in love with him in the first place.  Andy is such a stereotype of the rural, uneducated natural angel that I can't buy it at all.  A few characters are thrown in for reasons I can't totally fathom---what purpose do Larry or Veena serve?  However, I did keep reading until the end, and I had mild interest in the outcome.  I am glad autism is finding its way into popular literature, but I hope it can be written about in a more skilled matter in the future 
 I read the book before seeing the movie. The book was good. The movie was terrible. I did not like it at all. The movie did not follow the book. The movie had inaccurate accounts compared to the book and the Rose Red movie 
 I was sleepless and willing to try anything.  I mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor's back porch, where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly.  Despite all my hope, I couldn't detect any change in barking with this device deployed.  In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog 
 An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful "Eat Drink Man Woman".  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman 
 This book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to "modern man." The author assumes modern men are "broken" and therefore must somehow be "fixed," and he offers his advice on how to go about being "A Real Man." Therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men; the same men who buy Hummers and/or guns and/or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood (real or perceived).  The author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles. While this is true for some boys and men, it is by no means a universal trait. Any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is; he will also find this book insulting and absurd.  Mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing; however, a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself. The danger of mentoring is that of the "alpha male" mentality taking over and running a boy's or young man's life to his detriment: when that occurs, cultist mentality takes over. (A good, and frightening, example of this is Robert Bly himself.) Taken too far, this mentality leads to horrors such as the People's Temple (Jim Jones and his mass murder-suicide), Heaven's Gate, Scientology, and a numberless other dangerous Follow-The-Leader mind-sets.  For those boys and men who feel they need such advice, a far superior book is "Fire in the Belly" by Sam Keen. It does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that "Iron John" does and it is far better thought-out as well as written 
 It has good information, but if you are looking for an in-depth more complete book, this may not be the way to go.  
 It's difficult to review a John Coltrane album without taking it in context with the rest of his catalog.  From his earliest studio sessions with his classic quartet (the same sessions produced Coltrane" as well), "Ballads" is a fine album, but it just cannot hold up to what would come in the future.  Bassist Jimmy Garrison was the last piece in the band, having joined Coltrane in late 1961 after leaving Ornette Coleman's group whereas pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones had joined Trane's band a year before.  By the second half of 1962 when these sessions were held, this was a finely tuned unit.  The recordings are by and large adventerous hard bop-- all ballad standards, with Trane performing on tenor and soprano.  Trane isn't generally though of as a ballad performer, but he could really dig in deep and pull some absolutely jaw dropping performances (most notably "Too Young to Go Steady" and the lush and exciting "It's Easy to Remember"), and certainly Tyner and to a lesser extent Jones excel in this mode-- the pianist is totally in his element, framing the leader and settling up his own solos with extraordinary inventiveness and creativity, while Jones on drums gets a rare opportunity to show off his fantastic brush technique.  But as nice as this material is, Trane was meant for bigger and better things than exploring standards.  It's pleasant enough, it's a good listen, but his work would go so much further, even as early the following spring.  And certainly comparing this material to the triumphs of 1964 ("Crescent" and "A Love Supreme"), it feels positively lightweight and unexciting.  It's good material, and if you've a love for hard bop moreso than exploratory jazz, then by all means, this is for you, but I see this largely as a stepping stone on the way to something bigger 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed "Certified Professional Landlord" title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the "Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses" form ("To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.") asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. "You didn't come by when I had the money," "I didn't have a stamp," "I'm dead." A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book 
 Is that THE ROCK who is in this movie looking malnourished with the rotted teeth and sinister contact lenses make-up? This movie is horrible. But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are "Kickboxer" and "Bloodsport". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his "acting" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for "Revenge of the Nerds"... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work. It's not like they weren't paid handsomely for their services 
 Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 Poor casting, poor acting, unconvincing characters. The leading lady had no energy. There was no excitement, sexual or otherwise. Boring. One of King's worst. In contrast, I found King's "Swimming Naked" (Red Shoe Diaries) to be enjoyable. The acting wasn't great, but the stories were mildly entertaining and the nude scenes very pleasant 
 HAD MACHINE FOR 1 1/2 YEARS.  TRIED BROWN RICE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT BLEW THE THERMAL FUSE INSIDE.  HAD PLENTY OF WATER, IT JUST NEVER SWITCHED OVER TO THE WARMING FUNCTION WHEN IT WAS DONE. REPLACED THE FUSE WITH THE SAME RESULTS.  POSSIBLE THAT THE SWITCH OVER CIRCUITRY WENT SOUTH.  WOULDN'T BUY THIS MODEL AGAIN.  THE RICE COOKER WE HAD BEFORE THIS ONE LASTED ALMOST 20 YEARS.  
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 Jean Rollin is a name instantly recognizable to hardcore horror fans, yet meaningless to nearly everyone else. This ignorance is quite unfortunate because the French director concocted some of the sleaziest, most unusual films ever made during the 1970s and 1980s, films usually imbued with a disturbing mix of hypereroticism and bloody violence. I have often tossed Rollin's name around in impolite company with seeming aplomb even though I had never seen even one of the man's films. You read enough plot synopses about someone and you start to feel as though you know every intimate detail about their work. What I did hear from others about this director oftentimes did not bode well. He is apparently well versed in schlock filmmaking, which in and of itself is not a problem with me, a true lover of bad cinema, but several of his films continue to draw raves from a selected minority of genre fans. Well, I finally sat down with a Jean Rollin film, his 1979 effort "Fascination," and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Then I followed up with "Living Dead Girl" and was even more impressed. Then came "Lips of Blood," "The Demoniacs," and "The Sidewalks of Bangkok." No wonder most people think Rollin is a hack.  Prime proof of hackery is Rollin's 1974 Eurosex romp "Bacchanales Sexuelles," sometimes referred to as "Fly Me The French Way." I call it "BORING." Oh lordy does this film reek! There is a plot, if you can believe it, but it's so laughable I can barely bring myself to describe it for you. Valerie (Joelle Coeur) takes it upon herself to apartment sit for her journalist brother, who is ostensibly in the States somewhere researching a story. Val gets a little bored, however, and promptly invites her lascivious pal Sophie (Marie-France Morel) over for a bit of conversation. The two quickly begin drinking and...well, let's just say they prove their friendship in no uncertain terms. Welcome to the first of many scenes involving birthday suited Eurobabes that seem to run on, and run on, and run on again for what feels like an eternity. After Sophie and Valerie acquaint themselves, they turn in for the evening. In the middle of the night a couple of intruders waltz into the apartment and end up abducting the hapless Sophie. Why? They meant to nab Valerie because her brother's investigations into a sex cult threatens some very powerful people, and they hope to exert a bit of pressure by whisking Val away to the countryside. Ooops.   Valerie teams up with one of Sophie's boy toys to crack the case. After interminable scenes involving Val and this guy "acquainting" themselves, they finally get around to taking action. In the meantime, poor old Sophie runs head on into the leader of the cult, Malvina (Brigitte De Borghese), and her sordid minions. A rather lame punishment involving a few lashes with a whip follows, as do more scenes where lumpy French men and sleek Eurobabes "acquaint" themselves. Malvina, decked out in some kooky looking bead clothing, takes her frustrations out by target shooting a bunch of mannequins in the courtyard and screaming at her underlings. There's a bunch of bunk about a cache of film negatives back at the journalist's apartment, and a bunch more bunk back as Valerie and her new beau receive a visit from a maid named Jenny (Jenny Trochu) that involves--you guessed it--striking up an "acquaintance." I think that's enough description to prove the utter mindlessness of Rollin's film. Plot exists only to provide an excuse for matching up women with women and men with women. At least the movie gives us maid wrestling.  The most notable thing I can say about "Bacchanales Sexuelles" is that it's the first Rollin film I've seen that doesn't look like a Rollin film. If you've spent any amount of time watching this director's films, you know what I mean. The high atmosphere and deliberate camerawork that mark his horror films is absent here. Instead, Rollin slaps together a typical soft-core sex film of the sort churned out by the hundreds in Europe during this period. The dialogue is dumb, the acting negligible, and the clothing is scarce. The second thing I can say about "Bacchanales Sexuelles" is that it's BORING! Watching this film from start to finish requires a herculean effort. I felt like turning the DVD player off at least once every five minutes. In this day and age the sorts of activities we see in the movie just don't create a stir. If you really want to watch this sort of thing, just go the whole nine yards and pick up an adult video. While a thirteen year old boy might find this stuff exciting, worldlier adults (meaning anyone who has moved past the stage of holding hands with a pretty girl) will find it lacking in the extreme. Ugh, I can't believe I spent an hour and a half watching this pap!   The only extras on the disc are two trailers for the films "Castle of Blood" and "Grapes of Death," two movies that are "Citizen Kane" compared to this lumbering monstrosity. I apologize to Joelle Coeur, Brigitte De Borghese, Marie-France Morel, Jenny Trochu, and the rest of the lovely gals who appeared in "Bacchanales Sexuelles." You're all attractive women in that inimitable Eurobabe way, but even loveliness couldn't suppress the immense boredom I felt while slogging through this tripe. I'm sticking to Rollin's horror films in the future. At least with those movies we usually get an interesting plot AND lovely ladies. Au revoir, "Bacchanales Sexuelles." May I never have the misfortune to stumble over you again!        
 If you've got a subscribtion to any teenage magazine out there, have friends or watch TV, you've probably know all "tips" this book offered. All of it is very common knowledge. Drink 8 glasses of water a day? Check. Set concealor with powder? Check. Line lips with lipliner to make lipstick last longer? Check. However, its good for those who aren't feeling great about their look. It's got that "You're GREAT the way you are!" vibe. For the rest of us teens who want to know actual makeup advice such as how to do smokey eyes or even contouring, look elsewhere. If you're curious, check this out of the library like I did 
 I tried and tried to convince myself that this sounded good, or even acceptable.  Alas, the sound was so muddy, no matter what I did.  I set the EQ on treble boost, and I pressed the "3D" button on the unit.  Still as muddy and muffled as could be.  Besides that, there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a CD player searching for the next track.  Amazingly, I never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones.   I am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set 
 I bought the book because I wanted to know more about the implications and decisions made in the USA that would influence that 'other war against communism in the 1970s', in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe . I was very dissaponted by the book, since it so utterly racist (towards the whites in Rhodesia) that I cannot take anything for granted that is written down.  Mr Home should try to write history as a historian, namely with prejudice and retrospection. If he wants to write with retrospect, I suggest he introduces a chapter about Zimbabwe after the war, in which he should talk about the tyranny and cruelty of Mugabe and his cronies. Seen in that light, Rhodesia wasn't so bad.  
 First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced. Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the "Joe College" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company 
 There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.    With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.  Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory. 
 This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat.  They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time.  If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
 These authors are on the right track but they are more interested in impressing readers with their vocabulary than following through with some do-able solutions. I firmly believe that corporations need to catch up to what the customer really wants but this book meanders through a maze of technical and non-related issues which distract from the great theme it is about.  I trudged through the whole book waiting for an answer to the problem I could understand but there was absolutely no common sense I could grasp that would lead me to a satisfactory conclusion.  Felt like I was back in school again.  Ugh 
 I bought this movie because it got such great reviews.  What were they thinking?!  This movie is terrible.  I was expecting a nice heart-warming "chick-flick."  I was very disappointed.  This movie is extremely BORING.  It moves so slowly!  The whole thing just feels like it's dragging.  Boring, boring.  I kept hoping it would get better.  It never did.  Even the ending was lousy.  You can tell this was a LOW-BUDGET film.  Apparently they couldn't afford to film a wedding scene, or even Bella's funeral!  How pathetic.  Don't bother watching or buying this.  It's a waste of time 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone. 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 [...]Save your money folks; this book is just plain awlful! The book is full of hype and doesn't deliver. It is poorly written and truly a very boring book with no true depth or insight as claimed. Plus, the binding soon began to fall apart like the cheaply made book it is.[... 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 I am now thinking about buying this title. Ive read the opinion of the reader that backs it, but .... I am almost sure (due to many previous experiences) that the only shortcoming is not just about women, it for sure has been very probably written taking into account (hope I'm wrong) that north-americans are the only people living in this planet. So, if you are looking for readings that help you to succesfully deal with another and/or different type of society, or another type of country, opinions are so deeply oriented to northamerican way of handling life, they are not worthwhile and hardly applicable 
 This movie is so bad that it is almost fun, not quite but almost.  The movie is about a down on his luck adventurer/bounty hunter named Wolff (Peter Strauss) who must find three beauties who have been stranded on a planet and captured by some weirdo named Overdog (Michael Ironside).  Along the way Wolff meets up with Nikki (Molly Ringwald) who is a local urchin who agrees to help him for food.  I won't bore you with anymore about the plot, because there isn't any more.  This movie should of been a career killer to everyone involved so I'm guessing that Ringwald already had signed the contract for Sixteen Candles and well, Peter Strauss' career is what it is.  In the end I would pass on this film unless you have a desire to see what Molly Ringwald did before she was a famous or unless you are a lover of really bad B movies.  Why this never showed up on MST 3000 I will never know 
 It is always gratifying to see popular books about science get rave reviews because we scientists benefit from public enthusiasm about what we do. Erwin has a chatty and disarming style that is a joy to read. Unfortunately, it is a public disservice to distort reality as Erwin has done in this book. In depicting his role in the whodunit, Erwin has liberally embellished his own contributions and those of his colleagues. After proclaiming for years that the extinction was unrelated to the Siberian volcanism, this book now implies that such a relationship was his idea. The whitewashing treatment of his team's blunder in misdating the extinction and related events is worthy of the most guileful politician explaining away some scandalous act.   As long as you don't mind the plethora of factual errors and self-promotional aspects, it is a fine book. Unfortunately, it will not weather history well. 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 Ooh Dear Seth - what happened?  This book is an extension of purple cow, perhaps the bits he failed to add. Plain and simple it is anecdotal at best with no facts to back up his assertions and at worst it is simply another way of financing his vacations to Europe.  Seth's recent books are rapidly shrinking in size with less and less to say, if you are a Seth Fan (I used to be until he started churning out half-baked books without substance) pick up a second hand copy. Seth talks about holding off marketing slight improvements and waiting until a substantial customer driven Free prize emerges. Well Seth take some of your own medicine and bring us a new book with pages, content and a few facts to back up your ideas.  Disappointing...      
 This was a total waste of money.  The "Aloha" set was great, but this one was a major disappointment.  One entire DVD was nothing but re-takes and out-takes, the same thing over and over.  It could have all been scaled down on one DVD and been much more interesting.  We are big Elvis fans, just went to Graceland on our anniversary.  Elvis was a great entertainer and this is an insult to his fans for paying so much money to be bored!  Elvis was never boring!!!  This was marketed to get you to buy it, DON'T!  Save your money 
 It took a few hours to learn how to download the latest firm ware for the router and n-draft adapter (both from d-link).  The wired connections worked great.    The wireless conections worked fine for the B (add-on D-link notebook adapter) and G (built-in adapter) laptops, but the other 2 laptops that had the N-draft adapters would not work.  One n-draft adapter was from dell in a brand-new 1505, the other n-draft adapter was from DLINK.   Scary that the dlink adapter would not connect to the dlink router.  Even with all of the security disabled, the N-draft adapters would not connect to the router.  With security enabled, and taking all of the right steps to set it up, nothing would connect to the router.  It refused to recognize the security key.  After being on hold for an hour, Dlink tried to help me.  They gave me about 20 minutes of support before dropping the call.  Basically, they gave up and said that I should return it.   Three weeks ago, I mailed the items to Amazon.  It was well within the 30 day window from the date of purchase.  I am still waiting for a refund.  Why does it take so long?    Obviously, I can not give this product a good review.  Between the headache of dlink, and the slow response for my refund, this has been a miserable experience.  Dell tech support recommends the Netgear N-draft router.  Once Amazon refunds me my money, that's what I'll buy 
 While Connie Schultz often hones in on the truth like a hawk to its prey (particularly the "truth" as viewed by the Democratic party), her recurring thoughts on growing up a blue-collar Clevelander (Connie was the first one in her family to go to college and rejoices in the fact she was the "brainy" one among her sisters) and that this somehow puts her on a pedestal, wearies the reader after a while. Yes, she pays poignant homage to her past and extolls the saintliness of the working class, likes to stand up for all of the poor and oppressed: women needing abortions, gays, women past a certain age who like to wear long hair (i.e. Connie herself, she writes a lot about needing to defend her hairstyle) but it comes at the expense of alienating those who don't align themselves with her working-class heroine point of view.  The real rub here is that the gal lived in tony Shaker Heights and sent her daughter to an exclusive private school, and lives the high life with her senator husband while still berating those who drive SUVs.  If Connie got off her high horse more often, she might seem more the credible commentator and less the politician forever in search of prizes.  
 Michael Wood's account of the "search for the Trojan war" is distinguished by one central feature.  He has an astounding gift for saying in 250 words what could be better said in 10.  To say that this book is verbose is like saying that Mt. Everest is pretty darn high.  This book is the model of hyperventilated verbosity...droning on and on about granular details that are at least unimportant if not downright irrelevant.  In the end, it seems that Michael is more interested in hearing himself make noise than in telling the story of Troy.  That is very sad, since the story is one worth telling.  Moreover, the many interesting photos in the book tantalize the reader with the promise of information which Mr. Wood cannot deliver...or at least carefully hides in one truly huge mound of trivia.  This story deserves an author who can tell it.  But Michael Wood is not the one.  If you are a reader who enjoys flipping through the pictures without really understanding what they mean, then this book may suit you well.  But if you seek actual knowledge of the subject, look elsewhere.  Look, in particular, for an author who can distinguish the essential from the inconsequential while telling a story that moves straightforwardly from its beginning to its end.  Michael Wood is not that author 
 My objection was the implication that the "stars" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 What do you get when two of the most visionary science fiction writers of modern times combine forces to produce a novel of the near future?  In this case you get pure and utter drivel.  I picked this book up because Clarke and Baxter have been favorite writers of mine for years, but they obviously do not work well together.  First, a warning.  I am going to reveal plot points in this review, so don't read on if you don't want to see spoilers.  This story is filled with holes.  It revolves around the invention of a technology that lets people view any location both now and any time in the past.  Yet one of the first major plot points totally disregards this capability and sets up one of the characters to be framed for a crime she didn't commit.  Other things are merely implausible, like a worldwide obsession with history suddenly emerging after the technology is introduced.  There are also long, long, unnecesary stretches of exposition detailing, for instance, the true life of Jesus Christ, or the last work of Fermat.  I know that these two authors are capable of telling good stories, but in this book they have apparently forgotten the writer's maxim to show, not tell.  Some of the story seems completely random, without connection or purpose.  For instance, one of the main characters is revealed dramatically as a clone.  A mass mind emerges out of the wormhole viewer technology for no apparent reason.  The lead female character dies in between chapters and is barely referred to again.  Another intelligent race is discovered to have evolved on the earth tens of millions of years ago, and been wiped out by the collision that gave birth to the moon.  And, in a final unncessary twist, in the very last pages the main character dies and is resurrected hundreds of years in the future, but given nothing to do or say.  Overall, I can't recommend reading this book, much less buying it.  Save up and get the books these authors have written individually, and skip this sad mishmash 
 This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on.  To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture.  This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah.  Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 I finished this book last week and frankly I couldn't wait to put it down -- the author has no feel for the man or his ideas -- it is biography at  the most superficial level 
 That's all you need to know. It is terrible. Bad. Boring. I could hardly finish it 
 so i bought this item and i hated it. I wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me 
 When I first read this book, I enjoyed it. I was bothered, however, by Naipaul's peevish tone. After reading many other things by Naipaul I returned to this book. What I thought was simple peevishness, it seems clear to me now, is mean-spiritedness. And it is directed quite often toward Muslim people - not just fanatic Muslims, all Muslims. 
 This book was apparently written by Math PHDs for use by Math PHDs.  I found it to be pretty impenetrable.  With this sort of language report, and the shortage of "how to" books for beginners, SML is probably doomed to obscurity, which is unfortunate 
 I HATE HEARING THIS HYPE OVER STANLEY WILLIAMS!  THIS MOVIE PROTRAYS HIM AS A CHANGED MAN, BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.  WILLIAMS HAS NEVER ADMITTED WHAT HE DID.  AS ARNOLD SAID IN HIS DENIAL OF CLEMENCY "WITHOUT AN APOLOGY AND ATONEMENT... THERE CAN BE NO REDEMTPTION."  THIS MOVIE HYPES AND BEMOANS THE TROUBLE OF TOOKIE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS HE BRUTALLY MURDERED?  HE KILLED AN ENTIRE TAIWANEESE FAMILY, SAVE THE SON.  IMAGINE ROBERT YANG'S HORROR FINDING HIS MOTHER DEAD, HIS SISTER NOT ONLY DEAD BUT HALF HER FACE BLOWN OFF AND HIS FATHER GASPING FOR AIR.  ALL THREE OF THEM DIED AND TOOKIE MADE FUND OF THE NOISES THEY MADE AS THEY DIED.  THEN ALBERT OWENS, THE 23 YEAR OLD 7-11 CLERK THAT WAS SHOT IN THE BACK. OWENS LEFT BEHIND 2 DAUGHTERS A FATHER AND THE STEP-MOTHER WHO RAISED HIM.  THE YANG FAMILY WAS WARNED BY TOOKIES BUDDIES(WHO ELSE WOULD DO IT) THAT THEY BETTER KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT.  IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THIS THE STRESS LITERALLY KILLED ALBERT OWEN'S FATHER.  THAT LEFT LORA OWENS(THE STEP-MOTHER) AS THE SOLE VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS.  HER LIFE WAS THREATENED YET SHE KNEW THAT TOOKIE NEEDED TO DIE FOR HIS CRIMES.  WHEN THE GUILTY VERDICT WAS ANNOUNCED TOOKIE THREATENED THE PROSECUTION AND THE JURY.  HE ALSO PLOTTED TO KILL PRISON GUARDS TO ESCAPE.  WHILE IN PRISON HE RAPED OTHER INMATES AND ASSAULTED GUARDS.  HE SURE SOUNDS LIKE A NOBEL "PEACE" PRIZE NOMINEE TO ME.  NOT ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS MENTIONED THE INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT THIS ANIMAL KILLED.  YET WHEN HE WAS TO BE EXECUTED THEY WHINED LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.  YOU HAD LOOSERS LIKE SNOOP DOG(WHO WAS AQUTTED OF MURDER AND IS ALSO A CRIPS GANG MEMBER) AND JESSE JACKSON.  THE VICTIMS WERE NOT ON THEIR MIND JUST THE CRAPPY BOOKS(WITH SALES OF LESS THAN 500 SO NO THEY DID NOT CHANGE LIVES) HE WROTE.  THE FOUR PEOPLE HE SHOT WERE JUST A NUMBER.  LIKE JOSEPH STALIN ONCE SAID "THE DEATH OF ONE MAN IS A TRAGEDY THE DEATH OF ONE MILLION, A STATISTIC."  THANKFULLY TOOKIE IS NOW GONE AND HIS VICTM'S FAMILIES CAN REGAIN SOMETHING OF A LIFE. MAY THIS BE THE ULTIMATE LESSON TO AT RISK YOUTH; KILL PEOPLE END UP LIKE TOOKIE.  
 I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, "when am I going to laugh?" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison 
 The book is fiction and the author is a loon. He was a minor diplomat who has now become a religious zealot. This book belongs with those that expose Area 51 and Magical fairys living in your window well 
 The point that both sides miss: There is no where in any of the scouts aims, methods, programs or awards where it discusses homosexuality.  God, yes. Sexual preference, no. Just leave scouting alone.   
 I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G.  Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time.  Sorry.  I vote two thumbs down on this one 
 I started out liking this book, but by the end I couldn't wait to be done with it.  This could be a very interesting story, but Ms Thernstrom goes off on many non-interesting tangents which really ruin the book 
 I made the mistake buying this album after listening to "Never Seen Before" off the Def Jam's How to Be a Player Soundtrack. Never have I heard such repetitive beats. And the lyrics? Check it: "Who want it?/Come and see me like 112/And I'll rock the bell with Fox and L", said Erick in "Da Joint". Wack rhymes like this suggest that Erick and Parrish got back together only to make dollars and not good music. To tell you the truth, they remind me of an old-school Big Tymers. If you wanna peep their REAL skills, buy every album they made before this one 
 It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society. It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety.  The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in. Drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective 
 This is a poor performance, poorly written and produced for a youthful audience. It is not adult fare 
 It is an axiom of nature that for intimacy, impression, or insight that both a male prong and a female receptacle are necessary. Such technical utility is carried over into even our electric plugs and wall sockets for illumination.  Which is why poignant critical works and reviews of President George H.W. Bush's presidency are the more useful volumes to turn to, for Rebel-in-Chief: Inside the Bold and Controversial Presidency of George W. Bush pierces nothing. This is a flaccid, feeble, vapid work.  Rebel-in-Chief is of the orifice-pressed-firmly-to-the-sphincter class of hagiography, and fails both on its merits and its mission. Barnes holds himself out as a suburban Republican everyman intellectual of the not-too-deep variety. Perhaps this is the most telling dimension of the work, for if Barnes and his doppelgangers are either seeking to understand Bush's vision with this critical appraisal, or are his last wall of apologetic defence it is a sure sign of a failed Presidency. Everyone remembers from college that at the first siren of real trouble the smiling and backslapping Future-Salesman-of-America disappear leaving the trash and evidence pinned on the dim, the confused, and those who arrived late. When the centre does not hold, a rough beast indeed slouches toward Bethlehem to be born, and then it is brutes who must clean up the mess 
 I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.  While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible!  It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped.  It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all 
 For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.  On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 I viewed this film the other night when I had nothing better to do. The film is passable but it is too graphic, particularly the scenes depicting the scourging of Christ. I think this worst than third degree torture is purely cinematic and has no relevance at all in the punitive sentence accorded to Christ Himself.  Reviewing the sourging scenes in more leisure time, I think Jesus would have died than and there with such  cruel method that was used on him.  This coupled with lack of sleep, drinking water and eating, he would not be able to even walk straight up and much less carry the heavy wooden cross at all! I think the picture is rather an exaggeration and too graphic to convince me  as a Christian. Well...who am I to urge the commercial techniques used by Hollywood. On the whole, the film is better than the fabrication and untruth betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ in other later films about him by Hollywood which are tantamount to insult of Christianity and a great affront to the truth of Jesus Christ - saviour of mankind 
 I'm appalled at this marketing.  I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all.  This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents.  For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising 
 If you are planning to entertain a cast of thousands (or at least a few hundred), own at least ten acres of land, and have unlimited funds (including hefty fees for architects and engineers), then this book offers a few good ideas. Unfortunately, I was looking for something more down to earth, such as ideas for a modest gazebo or shelter that would blend nicely into the back of my modest half acre piece of land - a place for thinking or reading or conversing with a few god friends, a place to escape the rain, or a place for star gazing. This book didn't even come close to my expectations. 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 I could barely make it through this book.  I found a copy downstairs in my apartment building and thought it might be a nice read.  I enjoy knowing what people find meaningful in their lives.  This book is nothing more than a bunch of self-entitled snobs whining about their jobs.  I decided it would be best to throw this book away and top it off with my spoiled yogurt so nobody else would be subjected to this nonsense.  
 I hate lawyers.  What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.   Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"   Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.   But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.   Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.   I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?  What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.   Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.   Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.   So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.   Talk about contempt of court.  Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.   Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.   Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.   Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.   Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.    Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.   If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.   Otherwise, case dismissed.   JS 
 This book got all the reave reviews so I read it.  I cannot recommend it to anyone.  It's only has one page worth reading and then there's a better explanation of that principle in The Buffett Portfolio book 
 Someone (author? editor? photographer? all three?) isn't clear on the concept that this is a COOKBOOK. Granted, due to budgetary restraints, some cookbooks can't photograph every recipe. Problem is, that this one could have. We have full-page artistic illustrations of mixing bowls, piping tubes, beaters, 2 pages of empty cupcake pans, and 3 full pages showing paper cupcake liners. We have one page showing three (unidentified) cupcakes with two of them out of focus. If all those full pages that were dedicated to artistic fulfillment and depth of field exercises, had instead each shown 2 or 3 cupcakes each, every recipe in the book could have been presented. Captioning would have been nice, too. One cannot assume that everyone knows what a "vanilla cheesecake crunch top cupcake" looks like, but I think that it should be safe to assume that everybody knows what a paper cupcake liner looks like 
 ... I was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1... and of course i did buy it right a way.... then i was shocked when i started to read it.... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools Reference guide.... and actually a lot, lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well, i lost my money.. 
 This didn't feel like an authentic Seuss, just as another reviewer has pointed out... The narrative is stiff, the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor, and the story is just plain dull. Although I have no problem at all with presenting anti-war and anti-arms-proliferation sentiment in a format suitable for a child, I don't think that this book does it well. The overall impression I get is that of a message being sent in the style of Seuss, with rehashed elements, rather than a genuinely entertaining Seuss book 
 I purchased this cookbook because I have a young child and a picky husband.  I was thrilled to find something I could use so dinner time and bedtime were a ways apart.  Well, when I got this book, I was very disappointed.  I cannot pronounce half of the ingredients and what I can pronounce, I cannot afford to purchase.  Aparantly, working parents means doctors and lawyers who have kids.  Because no one in my income bracket could ever use these recipes.  Plus the recipes I thought I might be able to pull off, both of my eaters turned their nose just to the name and what it was.  To me, that's not very kid friendly 
 Children love to follow instructions, step by step, and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep, drag on for hours. Any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.  For example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? Great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! It is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?    Nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home.  
 I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being 
 I bought this album due to the song "Soak up the sun".  I was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd.  I still believe Sheryle Crow keeps it real(Just not on this album) 
 The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting.  But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance.  I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this.  He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter.  Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english.  Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you.  Wish you not here'.  It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making.  And then there's the lack of realism.  Half the time there is no one steering the ship.  In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day.  On this ship, no one steers at night.  When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's.  But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all.  They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond.  And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist.  He's not even in pain.  He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head.  This is what really spoiled the movie.  The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey 
 Deals mostly with higher demominations of chips.  Many people like myself collect as we travel and only collect $1 chips 
 I am a chronic pain patient who has found it nearly impossible to be treated for my problem by conventional M.D.s.  They somehow think it is virtuous to be twisted by pain on a day to day basis rather than partake of the evil poppy.  I found the chemistry cited in the book to be sound, but was taken aback by the anti-drug rant.  Surely there must be better, less biased literature out there.  I have to wonder if the publisher insisted the anti-drug rants be inserted in the book as a pre-condition to publishing.  I wouldn't be surprised 
 There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling 
 The only reason I rated this two stars was because my bird could care less about this CD.  I originally was online with some bird websites.  I have a cockatiel and she is so whiney (squawking - screaming) when you leave the room.  One of the reviewers said this CD did the trick for his bird.  Well I think I have a special needs bird :) The CD itself is soothing for me.  However, it doesn't do anything to quiet my needy cockatiel 
 Is not the worlds best cat litter. Does not last the length of time they claim it too.  It does control urine odor but stinks like wet corn meal.  They claim it could be eaten, although they don't recommend it, my cat was eating it and vomiting it up.  I wonder if they use corn that was contaimanted with a fungus that they could not use for human or animal food. The plus side was its light weight, "good for a person with a bad back", easy to scoop " no digging to get that clumping litter removed", and does seem to be dust free.  May be agreeable for some one with only one or two cats.  I would not recommended for the multi cat house hold 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
   I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.   I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.   I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.   If you really want a good book read: "Making it to Westminster" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down 
 We bought this unit for a 5-day trip, the picture is very clear, better than most but right after that trip the second monitor lost its picture.  We sent it back to the manufacturer, never received the item back and it's been about 2 months. Stay away from this product! 
 This GMRS 2-way radio claims to have "UP TO 16 MILE RANGE".  However, on the back of the packaging there is a statement in very small print that reads, "Maximum range can only be achieved over water or open rural areas under optimum conditions."  I live in a housing development in FL that has one small hill running through it.  That small hill and the houses (all one story ranch) limits this radio's range to less than one mile!  That's no better than a non-GMRS 2-way radio!  The lack of range is reason enough to not recommend this radio. However, the real "kicker" is that in order to leagally operate these GMRS radios, you must pay a $80 fee to obtain an FCC license! Bottom line: Save your money. This radio's "long-range" capability is "incapable" unless you live in the "flatlands" or on a boat.    
 one piece of advise: get your bachelor's degree in neuroscience, then go ahead and attempt this book. i was extremely frustrated by the complexity of this book and im a sophomore neuroscience student. im just confused as to why this book was aimed at the general public. there are tons of other books that are more understandable, and interesting. check out crick's "the astonishing hypothesis" and koch's "the quest for consciousness", they are more worth the money and time. if you're looking for first hand experience of a brain aneurysm then buy this book, it'll give you one lickity split...that's likely the only thing you'll learn about the brain from this book 
 I expected it to suck the gunk out of my skin...Or at least bring it close to the surface so that i could easily take it off....it didn't..too bad for me 
 I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing.  I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru.  They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories.  The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines.  I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing 
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 For new teachers going into elementary school, this book is filled with good ideas and helpful advice.  However, much of the writing is based on elementary students only.  Most of the ideas would be considered too childish to use with middle or high school students.  Also, many of the advice is clearly for elementary only (rewards for lining up in the hallway, giving students hugs, procedures for borrowing crayons, etc.)  Looking at secondary teaching, I found this book disappointing 
 If poets aren't interested in being understood, they will have to resign themselves to being read by no one except English Lit drones. There was a time when poetry was so popular in the USA that many daily newspapers had daily poems and the average worker with a grade school education could recite several great American poems by heart. That was also the time when poets wrote about things that people experienced and could relate to. I love Whitman. I have a Masters degree. I can read Spinoza and the Greek dramatists and poets with pleasure. I started this book because Stevens was said to be a great poet. After forcing myself through twenty of these poems I still had no idea what any of them were about. I might as well have been reading Icelandic for all I got out of them. Here's an example of how Stevens unnecessarily obscures his poetry: in one poem, he refers to "the halo-John." This phrase never occurred before Stevens used it. Its appearance stops the reader as abruptly as if he had driven into a brick wall. Who or what is "the halo-John"? The reader searches through the rest of the poem for clues. Ok, it is a religious poem so maybe he means St. John the Evangelist because saints have halos. But why not just say "St. John"? "The halo-John"  doesn't add anything to the poem. In fact, it detracts as the reader has to stop reading the poem in order to do the equivalent of a crossword puzzle exercise in order to proceed further. If the reader isn't christian, he may be completely out of luck. Stevens doesn't just do this sort of thing once or twice; his poems are full of this sort of nonsense. If a poem needs a commentary in order to appreciate it, the poem is a failure because this sort of poet is incapable of speaking to the reader without an intermediary, a literary priest to offer sacrifices for the poor, ignorant layman who has insufficient piety and intelligence to approach the divine mysteries of poetry on his own. The reader has his revenge, though. Poetry is unread. Poetry becomes irrelevant. Poets must either scrap with each other for literary prizes that mean the difference between starvation and three steady meals a day or slog away at teaching jobs since no one will buy their work. My copy of this book of poetry will meet its end in the dumpster. 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 This selection includes several composers of 19th Century Russian Cathedral Music, when the Orthodox Church in Russia was at its creative height.  Yet this album fails to convey what the Orthodox Liturgy is about, and the intentions of the composers.  Listening to this album, one would believe that all Orthodox music is written at an adagio tempo, beginning in the piano range, swelling to a great climax at forte volume at some midpoint of the text, and then diminishing again to a piano.  This is false: an American New Age selection of Mystical Music, not a representation of the liturgical tradition.  This CD fails to capture the moments of jubilance, of loud, even shouted alleluias, of allegro tempos, of dissonant chords resolving into glorious harmonies.  For example, this CD contains several versions of the Cherubic Hymn, one of the high points of the Orthodox Eucharistic Liturgy.  In Orthodox liturgy, this hymn begins with the choir singing about the choir of angels preparing for the incarnation of Christ in the Bread & Wine of the Eucharist, sung while the clergy do the preparatory prayers and incense the church & congregation.  The second portion is an ecstatic welcome to that incarnation, full of alleluias, ebullient joy, rapture.  This CD contains only excerpts, the first portion of the hymn: none of that exultant joy is captured here.  The settings are incomplete, artificially truncated. They contain neither the complete intention of the composer nor the integrity of the liturgical text.   For students of either the composers or of Orthodox Liturgy, this CD will ineluctably fail to satisfy.  Which is tragic:  the choir attains a dazzing level of performance, a balance of voices, an astonishing breath-control, phenomenal intonation.  The reverb is enough to indicate a vast, worshipful space, without creating so much echo as to be distracting or annoying (as some recordings of Orthodox liturgical music can be).  For persons seeking a comparatively shallow, new-Age "mystical experience by media," the CD retains merit 
 This book turned out to be another release of the original book from the 1980s and it shows.  It is full of seriously outdated information and old style, pushy, boiler-room style telemarketing tactics.  Worst of all, it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there.  What about qualifying?  I can already set appointments all day if I don't bother to qualify them, but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don't buy.  Save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
 I'm driven to write a short negative review by the acclaim this series of books seems to generate.  I suppose I'm alone in thinking that in reading a history of philosophy you should aim for unique perspective, erudition, or outlandish insult.  I don't think this series of introductions fulfills any of these roles.  While finding a general consensus in the rating of philosophical systems is a pipedream not worth pursuing, there are so many alternative histories worth perusing, that I would advise anyone with a modicum of lively interest in the subject to avoid these books.  Even if your looking for the comic book variety of "how to" manuals, there are better to find.  I'm repulsed every time I've browsed this title in the local superchain 
 As the parent of a child who was a voracious reader; (we read tons of books together when she was small) I really was not at all impressed with this book. I purchased this book for my friend's little boy, based on the reviews here and was so disappointed. Granted some time had passed since I bought children's books, but I have started buying them again for my grandaughter. I returned it because I felt too embarassed to give this book. The only cute feature about this book is the eye catching illustrations that would appeal to toddlers. Story or content wise, it's about as much fun to read as watching paint dry. 
 I bought it from another store, turned it on to toast it did nothing. Changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke. I smell a recall 
 If you are looking for some decent *narration* on WWII special operations, this is a fair *audio* track. But for a DVD this is a very poor and tired rendition of primarily foreign special operations during WWII overlaid on old conventional force war footage. At one point the narration was covering saboteurs in France while showing footage of the USS Arizona burning at Pearl Harbor! The narration seems factually adequate, covering a number of WWII foreign special operations, but the video includes virtually no footage of foreign or US Special Forces (USSF). The little footage present is primarily still photos that are displayed for a few seconds with narration that is rarely about the particular photo. Much of the commentary on USSF was based upon the Vietnam experience and the problems suffered by USSF because of the lack of understanding of unconventional forces by conventional commanders. In fact, it seems that the very small portion on USSF was added early in the DVD simply to allow the makers of the DVD to claim the disk included a history of the Green Berets. Following that pathetic check-in-the-block, the narration turned to WWII effectively disrupting any sense of chronology. Much better buy: the National Geographic "Inside Special Forces". That DVD is up to date and "the real deal". I am a retired US Army Special Forces officer 
 I paid for my Herbal patent formulas book but you I never got it! Could you please find out what went wrong. I recieved a letter saying that I purchased it, and paid for it but I never got it. I even wrote to you thanking you for finding the book. Please get back to me. Ric Cosentino 
 I loved Violet and Claire. That was my first FLB book and I read such rave reviews about Primavera so I picked it up and read it.The beginning was very good but as  story progresses it becomes boring and hard to pay attention to. Towards the end I caught myself skipping pages. It was that hard to read! I wish this story only focused on Prima, Paul, Rafe and Dionisio.  They are the most interesting. There are so many characters in this book.. Too much at times. I hope I can read this book again and enjoy it but for now I hate it 
 The transaction went fine. The product is comparatively far over priced. I was almost "drummed out" of an organization where I am the secretary, for spending that much on this item. We have a competitor's product for half the price, that rivals this Sony ICD-BM1 Recorder. Don't buy it!    
 After reading Robert Caro's masterful biographies (Volumes 1 and 2) of LBJ, I yearned to learn more about the background of Lady Bird--specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to LBJ but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward.  Well, Russell's book certainly disappoints.  It is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited.  The only new information that I gleaned from this book was gossipy.  If one  wishes to learn substantive information about Lady Bird (and of course about LBJ), Caro's biographies are a far superior source 
 I'm struggling through Shadow of the Giant. Normally when I read a book, I read the entire thing in as close to one sitting as possible. Giant is taking me a while - a chapter at a time, and I'm only halfway through after several months, and have no particular motivation to pick it up at any given point in time.   It reads like a plot outline, not a novel. Nearly every scene is "tell" and not "show." The characters are plot devices instead of real people. It just doesn't pull me in the way Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Ender's Shadow did. It's like reading through a textbook. "This happened, and this person did this, and that person did that, and here's why." With occasional bits of dialogue thrown in here and there that didn't necessarily show off the most important parts of the scene.  I don't think this should have been published as-is. It's a draft, not a finished novel. And considering just how long the draft was, when almost all of the scenes - written out properly - could've been 3-5 times their present lengths, this could've either been the outline for multiple books, or it needed a lot of pruning 
 I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.  I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't. The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become. I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them). It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet. It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.  DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.  Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.     Now to address all the idiotic controversy:  1) Play the ball, not the man. When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.  2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff  to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.  3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership. Deal with it.  4) Don't feed the trolls.  When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews. And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.  This goes for reviewers as well 
 Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study. But as the previous reviewer has observed, however, all of the tales in this collection are instantly forgetable as they are trite in conception and poorly written. They have the collective depth of creative writing exercises in a first year class. I threw my copy away 
 I bought this DVD because of the tango. I tired to see the film at a theatre but it wasn't around for long. The movie is not exciting. People say Duvall did this movie to showcase his wife, tango dancer Luciana Pedraza. She is NOT an actress. Her acting is poor. The routines are very short and too few. Duvall sort of stands still while she dances around him. Scenes of Duvall in bed with a prostitute made me gag. I wanted more tango. I can see why this film died at the box office. 
 I bought this since I'm a huge Ryan Adams fan thinking I'd like his first debut as a producer. It is alot more Country/Folk than I expected. Probably amazing if you really are into Willie Nelson, but I was hoping for something that had duets with Ryan Adams and Nelson but it isn't that. It's basically a straight up Willie album, so if you love him, well this is probably for you 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 This book leaves out the basics of how to use the code.  It uses code with no explanation.  The explanations add no value.  The index is incomplete in most cases.  It was very  poorly done.  I am not a dummy.  I was looking for a book that explained how to write html pages and use the language.  This book dwells too much on how to write a pretty web page.  It leaves out how to use the html code.  It has no value for me.  Don't buy this book.. You will be sorry and won't learn anything from it 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 it may not be that common.  Not that I am being demanding or exceptionally critical, however, the author himself did admit that people nowadays had become so sophisticated that he or she could manipulate his/her own body language that the real meaning behind many of the movements/gestures discussed in the book should be judged by the readers themselves. If that's the case, what's the value of this book then? The content of it is just too simple, if not sometimes naive. I am sorry that I had made a mistake for buying and reading this book.  For those who want to study about body language, "Never be lied to again by David J. Lieberman" is a much better choice. For those who want to improve their knowledge on courtship and dating, "How to make anyone fall in love with you by Leil Lowndes" will satisfy you well.     
 I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design 
 This "passing of the torch" from the Kirk generation to the Picard generation simply falls flat as a movie experience.  It's full of plot contrivances and an insane amount of technobabble (which even the commentary admits), while holding very little dramatic punch. And (again, as the commentary admits) the scenes where Picard and Kirk are together are simply not what they should have been.  Although this is not the worst Star Trek film, it's still a pretty boring movie. There are plenty of examples in this film of the kind of material that gives Star Trek a bad name. I would give an anti-recommendation to non-Trek fans (lest they think Star Trek is always like this). In fact, I can't imagine anyone but the most hardcore Trekkies even enjoying this one, despite the one or two good scenes or lines in it 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it 
 When you look at the title of this book--Planet of the Beast, you think maybe the author is referring to Jason? Nope rather a stupidly contrived planet nick-name for planet #666 how dumb is that? However being that this is a sci-fi Horror, I'm willing to just go with the flow and give the author Nancy Kilpatrick the benefit of the doubt. Planet of the Beast is a slow read, not totally intolerable like the last book, "the Experiment" by Pat Cadigan.  The first half of this book introduces 11 characters living at space station G7 including a meglomaniac doctor and his weasaly assistant which definatley had over tones of Dr Frankenstein and Igor all over it. Including their plan to "create" a new being by way of cloning. Total cheese.     After 200 pages of space regulations and botched interstellar protocol and characters pulling rank on each other our guy Jason finally shows up on board to wreak havoc.  Some of the scenes are pretty cool in typical Jason style, but again(which happens in a lot of these Jason X novels or the Friday the 13th novels) Jason takes a back seat to yet more character development and personal insight. I don't really need to know all that extraneous info on a character that gets disemboweled!     This book could have been any sci fi book, all you had to do was insert the word "alien" or "monster" into the spots that says "Jason X."  Technology on the space station is o.k. for a sci fi book that takes place in the 24th Century, some force fields, advanced nanotechnology, interesting space suits and laser weapons outfit the G7 space station/lab.  The Author almost gives you a walk through of the space station as the story progresses, almost like its a travelogue.      Oh yeah, whats this bunk with calling him "Jason X"? I thought he was just plain old Jason?  Jason "X" was just the number of the film, you know X=10.  The hokey camp fire stories being told by one of the characters pits jason against soldiers in louisiana swamp, and another has Jason back in the 1930's going after Dorothy and Toto. What was the author thinking? Fortunately the Jason and the Wizard of Oz scenerio is pre-empted to go to another scene and then rejoined as the character is finishing. Thank god!    Planet of the Beast has a better second half, but it was still painful to digest. I thought the action could have been a lot better, the urgency of the characters wasn't described good enough.  I also notice several typo's and misspelled words throughout the book.  Bottom Line......try to keep yourself awake reading this one 
 I did not like the book because it skip around too much between characters. I could not understand the characters. It wasn't really abour roller skating.  I just wanted to read about roller skating 
 Jacques Dutronc was great, it was the directing and the portrayal of Van Gogh that I thought was inaccurate.  This movie is only based on the last 67 days of Van Gogh's life.  Perhaps, I would have enjoyed it more if we  could have watched how Van Gogh evolved.  What was he like during the ten  years before his death?  I'd like to see a movie that can depict more of  the essence of Van Gogh, and not only focus on "the worst days of his  life".  There is a huge misconception in the world, of who Van Gogh  "is", and this movie only feeds it.  Read "Dear Theo":  Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo.  The book is far much better than  this movie.  At least, we can get the truth through Van Gogh's eyes, not  Maurice Pialat's 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 I don't doubt that UFO's exist, but this book is a sorry excuse for what the title promises: The real story of unidentified flying objects. It seems to me that the author is jumping to conclusions.. 
 This film is so stupid that when different locations in Quebec are shown the captions read "St. Jovite, Canada" or Montreal, Canada" like mentioning Quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for.  Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here.  The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!!  Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly.  She should have been the lead.  She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week 
 Only read the first chapter... Sorry. As people criticize China without being there, I guess I have the right to criticize this book without reading it entirely. So I guess this is just another book about how China wants to conquer the world. Unfortunately, this is not the only one. Let's review the first chapter very quickly. It is beginning with US-(NATO) bombing of China's ambassy in 1999...Mmmmh...Let me see... Where is the threat ? Ah and China was focusing its anger against US through their media (May be a Chinese Foxnews?). Really strange these Chinese people. Then it continues with the China's Communist plan where we have details about how US is spying China's airwaves.   I am wondering if the author has ever been to China or if he only relies on "intelligence" reports ? (May the same guys that found WMD in Irak ?).Unfortunately, this book is not available in eBook version, it seemed pretty funny 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 I have seen every episode(most, more than once). I am 15 years old. When I recieved this book, it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about the West Wing. A synopsis of the episodes and biographies on the gifted actors and actresses who star in the show. Anyone who would buy this book, has to be a fan of the award-winning Wednsday night drama, and honestly, if you are that much of a fan of the show, you don't need the book 
 I did not think that the book would have famed writers talking about their experiences in the world of sports 
 Some thoughts on "A Carnivore's Inquiry:"  A narrator can be both sympathetic and unsympathetic provided that they are interesting to read about. Katherine's closest relative, Hannibal Lecter, knew more about wine, food and culture than we did, and we envied him for it.  Katherine Shea knows very little about anything other than what brands surround her, and her ambivalence towards horrific events is merely adolescent rather than indicative of humanity.  Murray's exquisite skill at painting a scene is akin to eating nothing but Creme Brulee. Inside the twelve course meal that is the novel, one craves a greater variety of ingredients. I am sure her short stories are marvels.  Her characters are not convincing actors; their motivations for action are suspect when they are present, which is not often. We are asked to believe that our distant, dilettante narrator inspires lust and love in every man she meets.  This is implied and not convincingly rendered.  The historical recreations fail to reflect, augment or amplify the novel's main theme: man's hunger for literal or spiritual wealth (laid down in a paragraph on page 286).  Thought was given to their rendering, but not to their overall thematic importance.  We cannot believe in her resourcefulness as a character because chance plays too large a role in her life.  For a gourmand, she is surprisingly chaste about describing sex or her carnivorous meals.  Murray's talents would have been put to great use here. 
 this book in short, did not meet my expectations. I thought it would have much better pictures of the beautiful costumes. you think of this beautiful movie and how much of M.A's life was centered around clothing. I was expecting close-ups of the amazing craftsmanship on the costumes, and sketches (which there are none). instead, I was deliverd Kirstin Dunst's high school year book, with tiny, grainy pictures of her big powdered hair. 
 This text is very eccentric. I had to read it for an English class, and there was a mix of different reviews. Some loved it, some hated. I myself could not get through all of it (though I did make it to page 223). I suppose that the best way to tackle this novel is to realize that narrative is a big part of it, as well as is magic realism. The line between fact and fiction almost does not exist here. Logic cannot be applied when reading this novel. What is fact, what is fiction? Try to not distinguish the two while reading it and you may find yourself getting through it much more smoothly than I did. 
 Being a specialty roaster since 1975 and being part of a local specialty roaster group. I can tell you that starbuck's main accomplishment is their marketing ability. The coffee they distribute is garbage, and this doesn't have to come from my mouth, it comes from people who come to me after tasting their supposed "specialty coffee."  Starbucks lost their specialty status the moment you could find them on every street corner and/or supermarket. Where they beat most is their non stop advertising and brainwashing of people. The reason starbucks got big was because there was noone around to fill that demand, or more importantly, due to the nature of the specialty market, noone who wanted to fill that position.  The amount of coffee they are forced to produce lead to only one scenario, inferior quality.  Concepts of mass production. Economics 101. The higher the demand, the less likely quality is to have influence. 
 This book was not what I expected.  I was really excited to read and maybe get some fresh ideas to spice up reading time but this wasn't it.  I am not sure my expectations were met because I was a first grade teacher before having children but nothing in this book was very creative.  I was disappointed to find their activities were some I was already doing with my girls and just basic common sense.  
 Mere Christianity is a book often recommended to atheists by Christians and is touted as a rational, logical case for the Christian religion. Unfortunately, well-informed atheists will find that Lewis quickly uses a god of the gaps argument to explain his concept of Moral Law. Lewis's Moral Law argument will not fool anyone with a basic understanding of social evolution. All cultures have some prohibition against stealing and murder as well as some glorification of selflessness and compassion, but this is due not to a Lawgiver but to social evolution. The reason we have these moral characteristics is because they helped us to survive. Any tribe of humans who permitted murder or glorified betrayal would fall apart and die out quickly.  A warning to all atheists who pick up this book: Don't bother reading past Book 1. The Moral Law is the keystone of Lewis's argument. Without it, everything else he says is meaningless to atheists 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 Another reviewer mentioned the blurb on the back of this book, and that it didn't accurately reflect the real story.  I thought this book was going to be some kind of "monster in the closet" thriller.  Instead it turned out to be an testosterone-driven, urban-cave-exploring, Rambo-lovin', bore. So, I'm still trying to figure out why they threw in the five-legged cat?!?! 
 Why is it that when you combine great solo musicians into an all-star lineup the whole is usually less than the sum of its parts? I came to this CD with high hopes featuring as it does four veteran country singers with great reputations.  Despite not being an especially big Mel Tillis fan, I can honestly say that each of the other three have written at least one tune I consider among my favourite songs ever (not just favourite country songs, favourite overall: Waylon Jennings "Lukenbach, Texas". Jerry Reed's "When You're Hot, You're Hot", Bobby Bare's "Detroit City"). I also knew that Shel Silverstein was involved and thought that would be a good thing as he can be a clever writer.  Like one other reviewer here, I'm gonna lay blame at Silverstein's feet. The singers don't sound poor here, but they don't have much in the way of memorable lyrics to sing. The  overdubbed phony crowd noise becomes annoying and the repetitive nature of the subject matter (it's hard to be old) works against desiring frequent listens. One or two novelty numbers like "Cut the Mustard" and "Young Man's Job" would be plenty.  Highlights: "Rough on the Living" casts a jaundiced eye at the country music industry that talked up Johnny Cash after his death but couldn't find space on the airwaves for his new material when he was still with us (even though some of it stood alongside his finest work),"I Don't Do it No More" with Waylon on lead vocal is one of the better 'gettin' older' numbers here ("lovin' them ladies two at a time, I don't do it no more, I CAN'T do it no more..."), "She'd Rather be Homeless" is a pretty witty take on one of country's "four D's" (divorce in this case...the woman chooses poverty over the yuppie life with Bobby Bare..), and "Time" is a wonderfully bittersweet look back at a life well-lived ('So it takes a bit longer to walk up a hill/What of it?/My life now is much more fulfilled/But they're tearin' down buildings that I watched them build')   Low points: Why they chose to use a cliched double entendre like "Old Dogs" as the leadoff track is beyond me. ('Old dogs don't waste his licks but he can still bury a bone'). It's easily one of the worst songs here and made me not want to keep listening to the disc. "Still Gonna Die"'s joke on health nuts wears thin. "Me and Jimmie Rodgers" would be a great piece of Americana if it ever found a hook but it just feels unfinished.   Bottom Line: While I agree that too much of the country music coming out of Nashville these days is faceless and unremarkable, handing substandard material to great singers isn't a good way to make the case for putting the old-timers back on the air. A more convincing case could have been made. Let's hope the Dogs get another chance to leave the doghouse and they get more than table scraps to work with.  2 1/2 star 
 Please don't waste your money.   It was told in First Person in which it was hard to get into the book.   I didn't complete beyond 7 chapters.   I tried!    
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn't.    The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again 
 Poorly done. Read Publisher Weekly's review from above, they are right on, but a little too nice. It's amazing what gets past editors' desks - the dialogue is so cheesy, even young adults should be insulted 
 Don't be seduced by the plot synopsis.  This book is boring, the prose is generic.  Each chapter begins with irrelevant historical facts.  Science Fiction fans: there are more imaginative authors.  Literary types: there are similar books that are well written, like Beloved by Toni Morrison.  Skip this trashy book and save yourself some time 
 i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag 
 Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl 
 This was the first Harper story I read and it was dull. I enjoyed the Sookie story series. I won't be buying any more stories with this character. She just bored me and was pretty pathetic. 
 I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.   Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.    Cons:  In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.  Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).  The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.   Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.  The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.   After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.  Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.  So would I recommend this camera: If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere 
 This book may be great if you are a first time author and know nothing about book marketing, but it's basically a collection of emails (with many type-o's) put into book format. No index, much repeated information. If you work in marketing, it's not going to be useful 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 3 stars for its entertaining value, 2 stars for its real worth.  The author seems to lack some understanding of macroeconomics, as mentioned in other reviews 
 The fault may well be mine, but Conquest's prose style is a bit too dense and opaque for me. I purchased the book expecting to be enlightened; the stated purpose is to examine the "brain-blindfolds" that hinder our ability to accurately perceive the political and historical realities of the world. But through the first two chapters I had to repeatedly re-read sentences to try and decipher the point being made. I gave up at the end of chapter two, feeling like a stupid failure. Judging from other reviews written for the hardback edition, there are more astute readers who enjoyed this book and got something of value from it. Good for them. Maybe one of them could write a translation of it for me, or perhaps publish a Dummies version?   Let me provide a sample sentence, and if you can understand it, then by all means get the book: "One trouble, a nasty one, is that the more civilized attitudes of both left and right tend to spill over into their totalitarian variants, or at the minimum into one-sided tolerations, a preference for the more appealing totalitarians over opponents within their own culture, with whom they actually have far less real substantive disagreement." Want to try again? Here, try this one: "More generally, in Europe under the eighteenth-century monarchism, we run into the disorganized current of ideas considered progressive, as against the stasis and stupefaction of the old regimes - a current jammed with flotsam and jetsam, and one that yet flows today, even after socialism has steamed on to shipwreck."   If you not only understood these sentences but enjoyed them, I applaud you and I weep for me!    
 I paged through this book at the store , but did not buy it.  It looked promising until I came to the chapter about 88(?) kids caught going to school with guns each day.  A shocking statistic yes, but the author uses this cold "fact" to put a political spin on gun control.  Partway into this chapter, it is stated that if the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, well known as the Assault Weapons Ban, is allowed to sunset, then guns such as the AK-47 and Uzi will once again be allowed to be sold in this country.  Anyone who has ever read the AWB of 1994 knows that ownership of so-called assault weapons was never banned, no weapons were confiscated as a direct result of the passage of this law.  The law merely prohibted importation and new manufacture of nineteen weapons by name, and some others by description.  Assault weapons made prior to 1994 were allowed to be owned, bought and sold in the USA.  Gun makers made mostly cosmetic changes to their firearms to allow them to be legally sold after the ban went into effect.  The number of semi-automatic weapons in the USA actually went up, especially right before the law was passed in 1994.  The AWB of 1994 certainly had no effect on the number of kids who bring handguns to school.  I wonder what spin the author has placed on the other facts presented in this book.      
 Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a vegetarian. I have Sara Foster's first cookbook and absolutely love it. The pages are stained from use and every recipe I prepare is a big hit--scones, cookies, eggplant parm... This book however is lacking in vegetarian options (even sides that can be used as main dishes) and I don't find the desserts or breakfast items as exciting. I would highly recommend her first book however 
 i have Kaplan and REA study guides to prep for the gre, and i have to say i am not in love with this guide. in terms of reading lists this is really thorough, but those are available onlone for free. so save the money, buy another version and good luc 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 In it's prime this was probably a great opera and if you are interested in  the early culture of our country it is a must see. The opera  is difficult to follow and a guide would be helpful otherwise you just stumble through it.  Not much for entertainment. 
 I ordered the Journal about a year ago and received 2 issues, and  never received another issue.  I contacted customer service about the problem, used the problem  report forms(or whatever it's called) and NEVER heard from them again.  I get this email today telling me to renew my subscription...  (after I had almost forgotten about the whole incident)    What nerve!!! I remember when I bought this a year ago, another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription.  Back then I just thought this would never happen to me..  (the same thing happened with Vogue magazine)  Boy was I wrong.  The 2 issues that I did receive were pretty good though.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but I would highly recommend getting  this from another vendor or ebay(they're usally cheaper too)  
 My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0 
 I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse 
 A book titled the "Belly Button Book" sounds silly, cute, or funny.   This book is just down-right strange.  The verses are awkward, and the story seems meaningless. (Not that one should expect great plot development in 20 cardboard pages) Boynton's other books make this one pale in comparison.  
 ...unless you've never read any of his other books.  Don't get me wrong, I can't say enough good things about Robert Kiyosaki's books.  If you haven't read them (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, etc.), I highly recomemd that you do.  But there's nothing new in this book.  It just a retread of ideas already presented in his other books, and not as well.  If fact, reading it felt like a advertisment for his other books and products 
 What a horrendous follow-up to Mayer's previous recordings. With the exception of 2 tunes, this album is as forgetable as "Room for Squares" is memorable. In deliberately rejecting his signature style, Mayer seems to have lost the wit, the hooks, the musical ability, and the charm that characterized his last album.  
 It's not that the information insn't correct, but it certainly isn't insightful.  This seems like a mental exercise for a professor who just wants to get his name in print.  Right away you're in trouble becuase he has you go through an exercise and then rate your optimism to see if this book could help you.  if you are low on optimism, you need this book, if you are balanced, you need this book and if you are very optimistic, you still need this book.  My view, try to see things from others perspective and find out what your unique service and contribution is to a given situation and ulitmaley your whole life.  The rest will fall into place. 
 Suprised. I cant believe someone would buy this trash. He has no skills, he makes Lil' Romeo look like 2 Pac 
 This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever witnessed...gay or straight. I am amazed it actually got made, let alone distributed! I hate to be mean, but it was hard to watch Ms. Lesnick. Her talents must lay elsewhere. She can not act her way out of a box. Oy!! She should have stuck to her Rabbinical Studies. Seriously folks....you should just rent it to see how bad it is...you will be fascinated. I am sure Helen Lesnick is a lovely hard working woman, but what a flat actress. Her heavy black and blue makeup made her look like a Drag Queen and the fact that she says she's 34 in the film is insane! She clearly looked 45 +. I am all for accepting yourself as you age, but the woman had such deep lines in her face, she looked like road map. If you force us to stare at your face for 2 hrs (and tons of annoying Close Ups!! Oy again!)please consider Boxtex next time.  Well she got a film made and out there, starring herself as the lead. I am sure a great accomplishment for her...BUT, PAINFUL for us.   
 Say what you will about Disturbed's mean quality - they succesfully dug out a niche for themselves in the hard rock community with their debut based on confrontational shock-value lyrics, a catchy hook-based songwriting style, and an easily recognizable rhythmic edge.  That's all still evident on Believe. It's just that that's all it is: more of the same. Only this time it lacks the memorable choruses and anthemic (if somewhat cheesey) lyrics of The Sickness. The petulant middle school aggression is even toned down, and without it the bluff falls apart. Disturbed at its core is really just another industry standard radio rock band. Draiman's psuedo-intellectual posturing appears to have been a manufactured image in what I fear was probably literally a manufactured band.  Nothing on this album could be fairly called a highlight. Occasionally a riff will catch my ear as being relatively interesting, but most of it runs together in the same formless metal-lite stew. It's the sort of music you pump at a party and ignore. A pretty yawn-inspiring album even by Disturbed's standards 
 I have many cameras, network and otherwise, PTZ and fixed, and this is by far the worst one.  It has difficulty focusing, it's noisy, doesn't hold presets well, and the image appears to start "melting" every few seconds, then snaps back to clear.  The wireless connection is pretty reliable, but that's about all I can count on.  The API support for this thing is nil, along with the options they give you.  Tech support is usually no help at all.  I just purchased an Axis 213 PTZ, and it completely blows this thing out of the water.  No more DLink for me 
 I got this book used for well under the retail price. Now I feel guilty after reading all those glowing reviews. I don't deserve this book! What can I say? I don't like it. Mainly it's that I don't find the projects very inspiring. My use of embroidery tends toward embellishing clothing and linens. This book is for someone who wants to paint a picture with embroidery, or do a whole pillow or footstool. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I had in mind. I like a book more like Mary Thomas's, where you get inspired to use the designs for your own purposes 
 It explained very brod topics, the author goes on and on about his own experiances. I was just not pleased. Thank yo 
 This is one of the few books I have bought over the years that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. I thought the story was kitschy and trite, as well as badly written. As a dog owner she demonstrated quite a degree of ignorance, naivity, and recklessness, and I think the new age twist to the story was just pathetic. All in all, I don't get why anyone found this worth publishing. 
 I bought one of these and was quite disappointed.  I have two small kids who get fingerprints on all of there DVDs.  I sprayed one, dropped it in the machine, watched it spin around and then...  When I pulled the disc out, there were still fingerprints all over it.  Using my shirt, I gently wiped on one and it came right off.  How can the cleaning pad NOT work, but my shirt work just fine?  I took it back to the store 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 Classic Pud here.  I'm guessing he did this on purpose, just to flaunt something, not sure what.  Literally Cut, Paste, Spell Check, Get 1,000,000 check.  End of story 
 I've owned this workout for about three years.  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to shape.  It does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body.  However, I have to force myself to do this video.  The 35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired.  By the time I finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating.  In order for me to get through the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.      
 Don't purchase subscriptions from Amazon or Magazine Express.   The following are my experiences with a subscription to Hiragana Times from Amazon.   What this page doesn't tell you is that the Japanese magazines subscribed to on Amazon are filled by a company called Magazine Express and are shipped SEAMAIL from Japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 to 10 after it's released.   I placed my order in January and, to date, have not recieved a single issue. After several phone calls, the Magazine Express people (who fill the Amazon subscriptions) said they had to restart my subscription for the May issues which will take 8-10 weeks due to shipping issues. So after ordering in January, I will not receive a single issue of this uncancelable magazine until possibly in late July. Very poor service.    This is unacceptable for a magazine that most US Japanese bookstores (fujisan is one) can get within a week or that you can order directly from the publisher for only a few dollars more. If I had known the shipping policy I would not have ordered and the magazine supplier, Magazine Express will not cancel the subscrition.   I advise avoiding ALL Amazon magazine subsriptions due to their poorly stated policies.   **Update, I wrote this review in June. It is now July 8th and I've just been informed I must wait until August 15th to see if an issue arrives. I ordered the magazine on January 9th and I have had no resolution from either Magazine Express or Amazon who provides no way to contact anyone within Amazon about magazine orders. I reiterate, buying magazines from Amazon if a poor idea 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 I bought this hoping to add to my collection of Judy Reeves's prompts, unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of A Writer's Book of Days: A Spirited Companion and Lively Muse for the Writing Life.  The year's worth of prompts are in the kit's book, followed by lined pages.  The advice and encouragement on the kit's cards can be found among the pages of her Writing Book of Days.  I'm very disappointed that Reeves couldn't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work 
 Amazon.com notified us there was a new Unf. Events book!  Wow, Great, Order it! Not one mention that it is only a blank journal. Amazon, this is wrong 
 This is baed on one of 4 Novels that Sir Conan Doyle wrote in his Sherlock Holmes series.  Since the book has a lot of details and a lot of exposition that can really go wrong in a feature film length movie, I had expected that a reasonable change & corresponding adaptation were made to translate this into a movie.  Alas!  The constant mediocre suspense throughout the movie added on by Sherlock Holmes' very rude attitude toward Miss. Morstan were appalling.  The book says that Sherlock Holmes said "state your case" in a brisk manner.  "Brisk" is nothing close to being rude in its meaning of the word.  Dr. Watson in numerous accounts describes Sherlock Holmes as having a gentleness towards women.  He may not express any fondness for women but was chivalrous nonetheless.  Granted the character of Sherlock Holmes is not an easy one to portray for any actors, and so far Jeremy Brett captures it the best.  However, this one was surely disappointing.  Holmes' keen nature and energy was well demonstrated but his good professional mannerism was surely lacking & compromised.  I blame the script more than the actors really.  This adapation just doesn't capture the tone & flow of the original book.  I highly recommend short story adaptations like Adventures of Sherlock Holmes & the Return of Sherlock Holmes series in Granada Series intead of any feature length installment.  Short story adaptations were much better than feature length ones
