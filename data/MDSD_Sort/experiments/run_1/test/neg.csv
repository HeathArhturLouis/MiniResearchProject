 I have read several books in the Dummies series and found them all excellent, so when it was time to learn SQL for a programming project I got this one immediately.  Unfortunately, SQL for Dummies, turned out to be that absolute worst technical book I have ever laid eyes on.  It jumps from topic to topic without ever really explaining anything.  It uses examples that are unecessarily complex -- I get the feeling his examples just come from years of working with databases, rather than a desire to illustrate any particular thing -- and the examples are never explained.  Over and over, there will be a snippet of SQL code used as an example, and I will wonder, "what does this or that part of the statement do?"  But he never explains anything.  He just throws it out there and then moves on.  Dummies books always have a conversational tone, but the tone in this book is overly hokey and just reads like meaningless filler; all the more frustrating because there isn't really any content that it's filling in between.  All I wanted was the basics of database design and interaction, an enumeration of the commands used for creating and interacting with databases and why some actions are useful and for what, and examples throughout of how one would do typical things.  Instead I got an intolerable and incoherent ramble 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 It is NOT highlighted that this is a CHILDRENS book. We purchased with expectation of a substantial historical work and have now lost $13 for nothing 
 I find this book very difficult to read and probably will not finish it. The subject matter and the reviews fascinated me, but the actual reading of the book is very hard work.  This is not  like reading something by Richard Dawkins or Stephen Jay Gould.   This is like reading a college text book.  People sometimes believe that because a book is hard to read and understand that the author is expressing deep and complex ideas. Sometimes that may be true, but it is more often true that the author is just not that good at expressing himself in an easy to understand way.  Obviously I am in the minority here, because most of the other reviews gave this book 5 stars.  It was some of the other  reviews that caused me to buy the book, but the truth is that I  got more from reading the reviews than I have gotten from the  book so far 
 I don't like giving negative reviews, and I don't usually give one star, but I can't think of anything else to rate this movie. When I first read all of the positive reviews I thought maybe this was a movie worth watching. But, I was sorely disappointed when I did get a chance to watch the DVD. What really was the purpose of making this movie? And I don't think that anybody is jealous or player hating on T.I., they're just being honest about this crappy movie. Goodness, I had to skip through to the end, it was so boring and just...I can't even think of words to describe it. And what was so cute about Evan Ross saying that he had gotten some cuttie? Is that supposed to inspire other young black boys to do the same cute thing 
 This book had some helpful information in it. However, if you really want a great book on bad bosses buy The bully at Work by Gary and Ruth Namie 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This is the worst sociology book I have ever read, a complete disservice to the stuggle for women's equality and an embarrassment to the university which trained its author and to the press which published it. I was one of the subjects interviewed by the author. Her methods are flawed: she failed to interview both men and women working for the same institution, rather than simply in the same profession, making everything the men told her about their jobs worthless as scientific data. Her analysis is suspect: she didn't publish the full text of her interviews, but simply selected statements, leaving the reader no way to fairly judge the context or overall tone of the subjects, or judge whether these quoted responses were typical or unusual. Her conclusions are laughable: she found that men either seek promotion or do not. Men seek promotion in order to dominate and control women;  men decline promotion because they secretly despise the women they work with. It's too bad such an interesting and important subject could not be dealt with in a scientific way 
 My CNP told me to read this book (Sex, Lies and Menopause), and said we'd use its schedule (it's in an appendix at the end) for bioidentical HRT. It's a good place to start, but be careful about following it specifically without monitoring yourself.  Dr. Uzzi Reiss's book, Natural Hormone Balance for Women, gives clear information about various hormones, and the symptoms of deficiency and oversupply, something that is completely omitted by Wiley et al.   I hope the authors' science is better than their history, sociology, and editing. I've found numerous instances where they contradict themselves and are flat wrong when they're describing women's social history.    I don't like the gimmicky old rock-n-roll song titles for their sections; it makes it hard to find information on a particular topic, and is a sneaky way of making you wade through their ranting to find the information you want.    And I really don't appreciate their assertions that their book is "about biology, not politics", when their explanations of our biology can't even be separated from their speculations and commentary on women's social history and the politics of women's place in society.  The whole "Lies" section is more about politics than about biology! They assume that all doctors are either ignorant or in drug companies' pockets and will oppose you if you ask for their help in using bioidentical hormones, so you will just have to force them to do what you want, armed with the information and directions in their book.  They make snide comments about the women's movement and feminists.  And their recurring rant about drug companies and profits from drugs (and I'm no fan of drug companies!) make it sound like natural hormone therapy is free, which it is not!   To use another reviewer's phrase, it's hard to sieve the "pearls" out of the "muck". Hint:  the most useful information is in chapter 10, "Satisfaction".  They do have some interesting ideas, and some things do make sense.  But I know too many healthy, vigorous old ladies who didn't do any kind of HRT to completely accept their assertion that cancer is the inevitable result of menopause.   I'm afraid that if they are sloppy about their history and sociology (not to mention plain old word usage - e.g, effect/affect, choose/chose) they're also sloppy about their science.   Natural Hormone Balance for Women has much clearer information about biology - the effects of various hormones- and how to use bioidentical hormones, with none of the political claptrap Wiley and company offer 
 Really people, 5 stars? While the plot of Gantz seems like it would make a great series, what was achieved in two seasons could have been done in two DVDs. I kept wanting to yell at the TV, "GET ON WITH IT!" I wanted to know more about the characters and I wanted to see how they would overcome this strange situation they were thrust into and I wanted to see more monsters. But alas, all I got was DBZ feeling fights going on for many episodes and endlessly whining characters.   The art in Gantz is beautiful. The concept is so cool. The characters are rich and feeling. It just takes too long to get to the point and then leaves you empty with a confusing ending and bad plot holes.  Definatly NOT 5 stars 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid....I also read the book first and thought it was one of the best reads of my life....I recently bought a new copy of the book and still liked it very much....however I also recently purchased the movie version and it was TOTALLY laughable.....one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....so bad I suppose it could be a CULT CLASSIC in the same vein as ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES or REEFER MADNESS.....don't waste the money if you expect anything otherwise 
 I have been making soap for about 3 years and I have had a lot of botched batches of soap along the way.  Most of my mistakes were by following the advice of "experts" who have written books about how to make soap.  At the beginning I bought Susuan Miller Cavitch's book on how to make Natural Soap and Herbal Soaps and I tried to follow her advice.  I couldn't figure out how to calculate the lye. You have to be a "rocket scientist" to figure it out if you try to do it her way.  I followed her advice on putting wax paper in the bottom of my box and the wax paper turned to mush and I couldn't get the soap out without mashing it all up.  I started out by making huge batches of soap like she said and I found that when a batch of soap doesn't turn out you have wasted huge amounts of time, effort and money.  And what do you do with all that soap unless you are in the business of selling soap?  And what beginner is? I think l-2 pound batches are much better.  You can experiment and learn your craft and not have huge amounts of money lost if it fails. She has no recipes for small batches.  Also I think 80 degrees is way too low for the fat temperature.  I have found that ll0 degrees works out for me every time.  Soap making is really easy, not nearly as scarey as she makes it look.  I did like the sources at the end of the book and have found some really good suppliers from it.  All in all, I think her book is interesting to read, but just don't take it too seriously if you are a beginner.  If you have been making soap for a while, then pick it up and read it 
 PC hardware and software changes rapidly, and this book desperately needs updating. No discussions of Pentium 4 class systems and related current memory and operating system updates. Save your $. If you are ready to build, cuy the OReilly "PC Hardware in a Nutshell" book instead 
 The first thing to be said about Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages is that  the contents do not live up to the title. Perhaps this is an editor's decision rather than the author's, but the fact is that this is NOT anything like a comprehensive history of the subject. A better title might be A Study of a Few Incidents Involving Christians, Muslims, and Jews in Aragon and Catalonia in the First Half of the 14th Century. The buyer of this book will be disappointed on that score if he was expecting something more encompassing. Another disappointing aspect of this book is the author's disconcerting use of trendy post-modern jargon: it is full of talk of "discourses","narratives","structures", turning one's "gaze", "paradigms", and other terms which seem designed more to obtain tenure for the author than to convey real information and to constitute a satisfying work of history. The book does contain many interesting tales arising from the author's research into Catalonian and Aragonese archives, research which seems to be highly original on his part. Thus, we have vignettes of Christians, Jews, and Muslims gambling together and suing each other, incidents of interfaith sex and prostitutiuon, and intercommunal violence. (I was fascinated to learn that of Muslims applying for medical licenses in 14th century Valencia, most of them were women.) The governments of the time seem to have been largely ineffectual (a point the author does not explicitly make) with citizens resorting to assault, arson, and rioting often and refusing to obey the king or his officers, and petty nobles taking the law into their own hands. This book is not without its longeurs, but is in places very interesting; the reader who seeks a comprehensive account of the treatment of Jews and Muslims in Spain, much less in the rest of Europe, will simply have to go elsewhere. One hopes that at least the author made full professor 
 The Langoliers is my A #1 all-time favorite movie.  But I ordered the DVD from Amazon and it would not play in my DVD player.  I researched the internet and found it was in an old format that is now unreadable by newer DVD players (don't ask me, I am not terribly literate on DVD formats).  To watch the movie, I had to save it to my computer's hard disk in 5 gi-normous chunks (it would not save the whole thing to one file folder), then download freeware that I used to convert the format to something that Windows Media Player Classic (yes, folks, that's right - tho original WMP from the Windows 95 operating system - had to download that, too).  ONe chunk could not be read from the DVD because a sector was bad (?) so I am missing the whole first part of the movie.  I then converted each file folder using the freeware, and to watch the movie,  I have to sit at my computer and watch it on WMP Classic from 1995, and click on the next file folder as the previous one finishes.  Took me hours of research, but I love the movie so much, I had to get it to work.    [... 
 I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse 
 A required textbook for my kid's college class. I have an MBA and am usually interested in anything having to do with business. I thumbed through this very expensive book and gratefully closed it after slogging through a few numbing pages. If you're a business teacher thinking about using it for a class, do the world a favor, put your copy  out of its misery and send it to goodwills. 
 okay. has historical relevance as a memoir of an Afrikaaner boy growing up in S. Africa. 
 Although striking in form - very good paper, excellent printing quality - this book really loses in contents. The term "fetish" is reduced to (reasonaby nice) women in black rubber in not very imaginative settings  ... and that's all! The much better alternative are the photo books by Eric  Kroll, Roy Stuart or Richard Kern. Better buy these and don't waste your  money on this one.. 
 I ordered this unit on February 7th. Every time I checked back on the status of the order, it read "not shipped" and the estimated shipping date got moved out. I really don't think this unit is avaialble from the company anytime soon. I cancelled the order. 
 this is not biography, but libel with a good motive. For an unbiased overview of the polemic about dr. B. see the review "The Strange Case of Dr. B." in the New York Review of Books, Volume 50, Number 3 ? February 27, 2003. (i found it online) 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman 
 I began this book as a big fan of Erin Gruwell. I loved her spontaneity and creativity in the most difficult of classrooms, with the most challenging students. However, as I read, I discovered that she kept the same students for four years, and even encouraged them to seek her help beyond high school! What happened to teachers preparing students to survive and excel on their own? But even then, I was willing to give her a break. After all, these WERE the most challenging students and no one else really wanted to teach them, despite more senior teachers throwing their weight around strictly on principle. But then I continued reading and learned that the author got out of teaching entirely within (I'm making an educated guess here) five or six years, four of which she spent with the same 150 students. Now she's a speaker. At that point, I quit reading. Yes, her sacrifices and successes were impressive, but if all teachers were to burn themselves out or move out of the classroom after such a short period, where would that leave our students? What about the upcoming classes of difficult students? They simply miss out, I guess. That's not what teaching's about.  Sorry, Erin, but you have to stick with teaching for most teachers who read your book to truly admire you. Replicate your successes year after year, with different students, instead of with the same ones who get to know you and your methods. Then I'll be glad to give you the credit your undeniable teaching talents deserve 
 When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one 
 With 566 previous reviews (perhaps 565 more than the book merits), it might seem that there was little more to say. However, extremely few of the 566 reviewers have any expertise in biochemistry, a subject that Michael Behe mentions not only in the title but also throughout the book. He argues that his conclusions follow necessarily from the study of biochemistry, and he implies (without going so far as to perpetrate an outright lie by saying so in so many words) that anyone with a knowledge of biochemistry will agree. This is so far from the reality that even his own academic colleagues at Lehigh University find it necessary to post a warning on the departmental web site stating that his views are his alone. Far from what Behe pretends, nearly all biochemists consider that the studies of protein and gene sequences of the past 35 years have constituted one of the triumphs of the Darwinian view of evolution, providing a huge new body of data in support of natural selection. This does not make them right, of course: truth in science is not decided democratically, and overwhelmingly preponderant opinions sometimes turn out to be wrong.  Nonetheless, anyone adopting a minority position has two obligations: to acknowledge that it is, in fact, a minority position, and to offer very strong arguments that have some chance of convincing the majority. Behe doesn't bother with either of these. As he is writing primarily for non-biochemist readers he allows these readers to imagine that there is no significant opposition to his views, and as he has never tried to make his case before an audience of his peers he has not tried to deal with this opposition. Worse than that, he is content to attack Darwinian evolution without bothering to offer any kind of falsifiable hypothesis to replace it.  Perhaps the most serious fault in the book is the confusion that pervades it between studies of the origin of life and studies of evolution. Although Charles Darwin did have some suggestions to make about the origin of life it is not that that he is famous for: his reputation lies in the theory of natural selection, which is not concerned with the origin of life but with its subsequent evolution. It is perfectly possible to think that there remain serious difficulties in understanding how the first organisms came to exist but at the same time that natural selection offers an almost complete explanation of evolution. Indeed, that would be the position of most biologists: hardly anyone considers that the origin of life is well understood. In the book, however, the ideas of irreducible complexity are presented as if they were an argument against natural selection, when they are nothing of the kind. Insofar as they are worth bothering with at all, they draw attention to some of the points that a theory of the origin of life will need to explain.  In relation to the questions that most exercise creationists -- the degree of relationship between humans and apes -- irreducible complexity has no relevance whatsoever. All of the examples that Behe gives, such as blood clotting, operate exactly the same in chimpanzees and humans, and have precisely nothing to say about whether or when chimpanzees and humans had a common ancestor. The biochemical evidence actually goes in the opposite direction from what creationists would like: 40 years ago virtually all palaeontologists thought that the separation between humans and African apes occurred about 30 million years ago, but now almost everyone agrees that it was very much more recent, and it is precisely the mountain of biochemical data that has brought about the change. In fact Behe tells us that he finds the idea of "common descent (that all organisms have a common ancestor) fairly convincing" -- a sentence that seems to have escaped the attention of creationist readers anxious to find a real scientist saying things they think are in support of their views.  With all this, why give the book two stars? The first is because one star is the least that Amazon allows, and the second is because although this book is dangerous and seriously misleading for non-specialists, it is also one that scientists, especially biochemists and molecular biologists, probably do need to make the effort to read, if only to know at first hand what the "scientific" case against evolution consists of 
 I was really expecting to get more out of this book.  First of all, I find the Daily 16 to be an excellent workout.  I had visible results after the first few days.  The rest of the book, however, is too thin.  Outside the Daily 16, the book really was not helpful.  It has sections on recruit training and on OCS, but they are mostly photographs with little information.  Most pages have a giant photograph and only one paragraph of text.  The recruit and OCS sections merely focus on certain points of training and do not give a comprehensive overview that you would expect out of a full-size book.  The writing style is also juvenile and simplistic, almost on a child's level.  In summary, the boot camp and OCS sections (more than half of the book) are nothing new to anyone who has perused the official USMC website.  The nutrition section was a major disappointment.  All it does is provide basic nutritional information that anyone who took Health in high school already knows.  The advice is very general, with obvious points such as "drink a lot of water" and "not all fats are bad" being common.    Some example meals and diet advice that is not common knowledge would have made this section worth including.  As is, it's a half-hearted attempt to fill pages.  The title of this book is "The Marine Corps Workout."  Of its 200-plus pages, only about 80 pages (the majority of which are oversized photos) are dedicated to the workout itself.  The sections on recruit and officer training do not count, because no attempt is made in those sections to show the reader how to do those exercises.  They are merely pictures of recruits in training for entertainment's sake.  The rest of the book is just filler to make it worth selling for ten bucks.  I think most of the people who rate this book highly are rating it merely on the basis of the Daily 16.  I give the workout itself five stars, but the Daily 16 routine is freely accessible on the Internet and not worth buying a book for.  Just google "daily 16" and see what I mean.  Outside of the workout, this is the kind of book you'd pick up off the library shelf, flip through for about 15 seconds, and put back.  You do not need to buy this disappointing book 
 These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them 
 I don't get it. I really don't. I like to think of myself as being open-minded to music in all forms -- indie punk, hardcore, underground hip-hop. But minute after minute of atmospheric noise -- this is all wrong. Just wrong.   "Human Animal" is an evil, evil record, and I need to get it out of my house before something terrible happens.  Somebody out there will like it. Anybody wanna buy my copy

 I bought this with great anticipation.  I was quite disappointed when I got it.  Billy Idol was never one of my favorites.  I don't recommend this one.  Save your money for something else 
 This book is full of typos; what happened to proofreading...is that a lost art/job?  This book is also a good example of what Andy Rooney spoke of; authors making thousands on the backs of others.  Nothing is original by the author in this book; it is merely a compliation of the works of others.  You would think at least, since the author did have to compose anything, she could have at least proofread it 
 I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and the second one was OK, but not as good as the first, but this one was just terrible!  I gave it two stars instead of one because I know that Ms. Myers is capable of much better than this.  This book is poorly written and poorly edited.  There are glaring mistakes in it, and the plot is so loose that you could drive a truck through it.  The last few chapters are truly terrible, and rather than feeling anything for the main characters, I just wanted to finish the book.  I will read one more in this series and if it's as bad as this I will not continue.  I did enjoy the first in her Den of Antiquity series, and will continue with that one unless the same thing happens with that one that has happened here.  It appears that Ms Myers is trying to make a slapstick comedy, and it falls flat 
 Beneath my comments, writes Roseblatt:  ===================== In chapter 4, he is concerned with the 'limits of arbitrage' (the original title of this paper, published in the JOF in 1997). This paper is definitely worth reading to understand the problems with hedge funds and other arbitrageurs. However, linking the limits of arbitrageurs to 'inefficiency of the market' is erroneous. The very fact that arbitrageurs can not take advantage of what they think are mispriced assets, due to collateral constraints (Schleifer's hypothesis), shows that the market is efficient, since no free money is floating around.  =============================  No, with the 'limits of arbitrage', the mispricing cannot be corrected quickly. The logic lies like this: suppose A sees the arbitrage opportunity, but due to the "limit", he can only trade certain shares, and makes $10 FREE MONEY. He knows there is still another $10 "on the table", but he cannot take action anymore. At this point, if no one else sees this arbitrage opportunity, the market remains inefficient until another arbitrageir B jumps in and remove that "remaining $10 on the table". Of course A and B made "free money". Shleifer's treatment is perfectly Okay. Roseblatt's rebuttal is illogic and obviously wrong.  However, EMH itself is a hoax. It is not scientific at all. I believe in the early days, financial economics was dominated by people who had little quantitative or science training, therefore, they could only do something like EMH sort of soft libral arts type of research. To me, it is not EMH, it is how quickly the information gets reflected in stock prices; and how big is the limit of arbitrage. Nothing else. I suggest the new generation of high-level finance researchers should totally discard this spurious EMH topic. Period.  
 This book uses ONE single map on every page to document the movement of various people over time.  However, it does not  designate major landmarks.  It tells of tribes crossing the Danube and the Volga but these rivers are never labeled.  It refers to the Tigris and Euphrates but you need another map to tell you where they are.  When major landmarks are not identified it is hard to understand how this can be called an Atlas.  The history is disjointed and poorly written.  The only reason to buy this book is that you don't have a match with which to burn your money 
 Waste and Want is a book in the same way that 10,000 pennies are $100.  Technically it is correct.  But it is less useful and more tedious than one would like.  Ms. Strasser has assembled this book like an old time ransom note.  But instead of using words cut out from magazines, she used 568 citiations.        A ransom note is short, direct and to the point.  Waste and Want cannot be accused of these traits.  Most of the quotes appear to come from old household manuals, for example, the 1835 edition of The American Frugal Housewife.  (Imagine some future historian expounding on the 21st centry american household using Martha Stewart as her main source.)       The book is massively, stunningly unreadable.    If your opinion is that all waste is evil, you might be able to stomach it.  But otherwise read Rubbish by William Rathje - much more enjoyable and educational 
 Every day I drive long distances so I thought that getting this on CD would be worthwhile.  Unfortunately, the author narrates her book which I think is a big mistake.  She has a very distracting accent and reading style.  It doesn't help that she begins the first chapter by giving us a detailed description of the daily activities of her cat.  After tolerating about two and a half minutes of this, I skipped to the next track.  That was about 9/11.  I don't have any fear or anxieties about terrorism so I skipped to the next track.  The subject matter sounded interdesting but again, I just couldn't get past her accent.    I really think that unless authors are good speakers, they should leave the narrations to trained professionals. 
 I didn't have high expectations for this movie, yet it still managed to completely disappoint me.  I adore Robin Williams, and his performance was the best part of the movie.  But the script was abysmal and Sara, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was a completely one dimensional character.  The antics of the sidekick robot and the "flubber" itself were just plain embarrasing to watch.  Too bad, because the idea is great - but frankly, the original was pretty bad too. They really could have done so much with this story either the first OR the second time around 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 This was the only book I bought in '92 a year before my divorce became final.  I was really in need of solid advice, and got rooked. Any attempt I made to follow this author's misguided logic, only secured my place in the "Suckers Hall of Fame." Things like; 1) give the woman more alimony to releive HER money-stress and she'll remarry sooner, and get off your back!  Baloney!  2) legally tie your child support increases to a yearly cost of living index found in the Wall Street Journal  or 3) why not suggest the child live in the marital home while the parents move in and out for visitation... yea right!  If I rememebered anything from 1993, it was how I trusted this author during the most difficult time in my life, only to be fooled with his idealistic, liberal views of divorcing couples.  Hey, SAM, most people don't have alot of money and they still fight.  Got any good advice for the majority?  I didn't think so.  Don't buy this book, I'm surprised it is still around!  I gave it 1-star because I had to 
 My suggestion to other readers is - do not waste your time or money on this book! When the big 30 began to approach I ordered the book from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very disappointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information and it would be funny. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of drivel. With the constant hysteria about turning 30 in this book, it will make you have a mental breakdown.  The book feeds into this false culture of fear.  Also, the book reads like a college term paper - a bad college term paper 
 I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book. 
 I have VERY dry frizzy hair.This treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.I like this better for use as a grooming gloss 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 I read the book because I had heard good things about it.  I was disgusted by what I saw.  I've always been a moderate, so this is not the ramblings of some right wing nut who just hates liberals.  Ted Rall hates America with an almost satanic passion.  After reading the book, I went online and searched for Ted Rall's cartoons.  These cartoons are even worse than the book.  He advocates the deaths of our soldiers and makes one cartoon actually claimed that ALL soldiers are rapists and sadists.  Ted Rall is a sick and twisted human being.  Do not send any of your money to this sadistic and anti-american nut 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 In comparison to other books available about adobe houses, the content of this book offers little range and depth. Other choices were less superficial 
 I would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since I have never received my subscription. I have waited over 4 months since I first paid. I have called and was told I would get a call back telling me when I could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine. That was 4 weeks ago. If you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else. It is not here and no telling if it will ever be here 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 I never received the book. Got in touch with the senders. they supposedly sent me another copy, but that too was never receive 
 My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment.  This "game" is really hard to call a game.  It's more like one long reading exercise.  Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again.  Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to "unlock" the game.  Then in order to play the "game" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the "game" and then try to explain it to my son.  I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware 
 This edition of "James Bond: The Secret World of 007" is rather superfluous. The produces of CASINO ROYALE have indicated that this film is going to be a new beginning for James Bond. If so, the 20 James Bond films in the series that preceded CASINO ROYALE really have no continuity in relation to this film. Therefore an edition dedicated solely to this film would have been more appropriate. Just end it with the sections in addendum to DIE ANOTHER DAY. The James Bond based in the Twentieth Century had a good run 
 I am not at all satisfied.  I originally sleceted a "new" Dancing Gizmo plush doll.  I received a old, used, worn-looking Gizmo doll that does not dance or make sound as it advertised!!  I would like a customer service rep get back to me.  I would like to get a discount since I paid the regular rate price for a new dancing Gizmo doll!!!!!!!  --Ceci Milia 
 But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean 
 This book is a mess.  The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership  than before he/she read it.  What's worse is that the intro has nothing at  all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right).   The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by  Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of  nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched  and badly written.  I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows  anything at all about some of the people he writes about.  Skip this one. I  suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of  leadership with clear, well researched examples 
 This shirt is one of a kind.  It was the only dark navy shirt with a large Chicago Bears logo on it that I could find.  It was a little large for me, but looked great the first time I wore it.  However, after just one wash, some of the logo started peeling off!  I can't imagine what this shirt will look like after next season, probably will just be a navy long sleeve shirt...buy this shirt with caution 
 Don't buy this book.  Buy The New Cabbage Soup Diet and with it, Thin for Life and any high-protein, low carb diet (Hear me out.  More below).    Estrich is shrill, and very excitable, but her methods are unworkable because she doesn't really teach people how to eat, only how to avoid bingeing.  A more sensible book would for example contain guidance on what a portion is, something about which most are clueless; this one doesn't.  Nor does she suggest anything much other than gritted-teeth willpower in the face of hunger - no volumetrics, no GI, no stress on fluids.  She seems not to know what causes hunger - hint, it's not lack of food, and a turning point for me was when I realised that hunger came back when I ate a lot just as it did when I ate only a little - and to hope that if women just tackle it with a big NO, it will go away.  Well, it won't.  Unsurprisingly she herself seems to have a problem with bingeing and with portion control - can't eat just one Oreo - and I'd be willing to bet that she'll regain some or all of the weight because she sounds and feels desperate and deprived.  I hope I'm wrong.  There is some good in here, though.  It is true that to be a size 6 you really can't eat much of anything.  It's good to hear this said.  It's also good to encourage women to a fairly low-cal regime and to the idea that no weight loss comes without some hunger and sacrifice.    But this plan is unlikely to work because it doesn't address the causes of hunger and fullness, or the pleasures of food; it's telling that all Estrich's temptations are junk food and convenience food.  Nor does Estrich address what exactly exercise does, though she feels sure it builds muscle bulk - not on a very low-protein diet it won't.    I have myself maintained a fifty-pound loss for almost three years, as follows:  1.  a week of New Cabbage Soup; I enjoy the culinary ingenuity required to make it good (my favourite way is Thai, with chili and lemongrass).  I don't do brown rice in the soup - ergh! - but do the equivalent of rolled oats instead.  I follow this with  2.  2 weeks of 20 carbs a day or less, no calorie counting Then  3.  1 day when I eat what I like but without bingeing.  So if I want a croissant I have one, but ONE, not five.  Usually I like to cook a fmaily meal on this day.  Last time it was roast duck, wild mushrooms, sald and apple cobbler.   4.  More cabbage soup/ watching cals on lowcarb if I'm noticing some weight creeping back.  Less cabbage soup if I am losing too fast/going below my threshold.  I also run/do eliipse/do weights for 1 hour plus every single day.  I am 44, full-time professional, and a mother.    This is what works for me.  The book is what worked for Susan.  You, dear reader, will arrive at what works for you through trial and error, but Thin For Life is a better guide to doing this.   
 How can I put this in a nice way?  I've both written and read fan fiction that was better than this book. Now I'm not as passionate about Trek as some, and I don't have a favorite author(s).  However I've read enough paperbacks to discern a good book and not a good box.  And this isn't a good book and should have sunk with the ship that Diane Carey was supposedly on.    Spoilers from here on out for those whom don't want to know...  Star Trek: The Next Generation, Ship of the Line reads like a reunion movie of your favoriate television show.  One where ever cast member and guest star to ever have appeared is brought back and given some screen time.  And to add insult to injury it's just about as bad as those reunion movies are.  The book is supposed to tell the after episode adventure of Morgan Bateson, introduced to Next Gen in the episode "Cause and Effect" who's since then become something of a cult icon as captian of the USS Bozeman.    Now you'd expect being a Next Gen Trek book that captain Picard and company would factor in.  However, so many cast members are in this book that only Lt. Uhura and Lt. Checkov are absent - literally.  The characters appearing in this book vary badly in the way that they are written.  From Cheif Enginneer LaForge,  who appears as if he was a giddy and naive cadet, taking a back seat to Montgomery Scott.  To Counselor Troi and Dr. Crusher whom appear initially as if they were giddy school girls and ultimately as outraged gawkers if there were such a thing.    Captain Picard appears sullen and moody about the desctruction of the Enterprise D (granted), but sullen and moody to an extreme which is beyond norm.  Its as if he's facing a life altering moment all the while wanting to scream to him that a ship is a ship is a ship.  And what happened to the Enterprise D (if you've ever seen the Trek movie Generations) isn't even his fault!  It's like your favoriate first car.  Yeah it was your baby and it was totalled in an accident.  You're definetlly going to miss it.  But it's a car, a machine.  You can obtain a new one just as Captain Picard can be assigned a new ship.  Commander Riker isn't portrayed much better, but does appear to be genuienlly worried about his friend and captain.  Data, you'd wish would just turn off his damn emotion chip the way it makes him come across.  Captain Morgan Bateson is portrayed as ... I can only describe it as with a casual swagger unbecoming of a Star Fleet Captain.  Someone whom runs a very loose ship until he has to tighten up ranks for appearences.  Totally contray to the way in which he was portrayed in his breif cameo at the end of the episode "Cause and Effect."  Told by Picard and Riker, that he and his crew are in the future with no avenue of possible return and he all but collapses figuratively speaking.  But yet is portrayed as a captain as legendary as Kirk.  A true Starfleet captain wouldn't have to be told he had just passed through a temporal loop, he should already know before even steps foot on the Enterprise D.  The only characters to at all be anything like themselves throughout this book are Captain Kirk and Captain Spock.   We swing from as far back as the original series and all the way to the latest Next Gen movie at the time "First Contact."   Minus Captain Bateson's swagger in the way he runs his ship, we start this story with the USS Bozeman in deep space on the Federation frontier with the Klingon Empire near Starbase 12 at the height of tension between the two powers.  Good enough for the most part.  The Bozeman is described in error as a "cutter" but anyone whom knows Trek starship design can see that the Bozeman is based on the same hull as the Miranda/Avenger class frigate(s) and has a sizeable presence.  It definetly is not a cutter which are normally very small and minimunally crewed if Diane Carey the author knew her nautical terms.    After having rendevoued with Enterprise NCC 1701A, which immediately after transfering two crew members, departs for the staging area in advance of a Klingon task force moving towards the border.  The Bozeman is left in typical Trek fashion to luck into being the only ship that stands between Starbase 12 and the real threat, a Klingon vessel commanded by what we're told is Captain Bateson's longtime rival Klingon Commander Koraza.  Combat ensues as one would imagine before the Bozeman is cast adrift in the nebula/temporal loop that will bring it to the time of Next Gen.  The Enterprise 1701A ultimately doubles back and intercepts Koraza.  Nice appearence by the Enterprise A, and equally nice that Kirk and Spock make breif cameos as well.  But what should pick up in Next Gen times and continue as the rivally of Captain Bateson and Commander Koraza soon is swamped by countless appearences, bad writting, wasted pages of dialog and a lack of basic proofing by the author and/or the publisher.  As a previous reviewer touched on, the Bozeman is refered to as a museum piece having finally returned to Starbase 12 after being found by the Enterprise D.  A new Bozeman is refered to late in the book.  Unlike that reviewer, whom I respect, I can believe that a newly commissioned vessel could in fact be named in honor of the original ship,rather than the original ship almost a century old by Next Gen time refitted and put back into service.  But unlike the author Diane Carey I cannot believe that Star Fleet would just rename a vessel, which is frowned upon in nautical circles.  Pages are wasted with endless arguements between Bateson and Riker, negative group discussions between Picard and company over how he won't be taking command of the Enterprise E.  Captain Bateson, and whether or not he's qualified because of a quirk of senority that takes into account traveling from the past to the future and how many years you traveled.  Pages that could been spent on the larger story are wasted with a holographic Captain Kirk, from the original series now, with Captain Picard along for the ride on several historic missions in some kind of touch stone life altering decision type of moment for Captain Picard.  These pages should have been spent detailing and furthering the story of rivalry between Bateson and Koraza.  And basic lack of proofing in how the son of Klingon Commander Koraza is also refered to as the son of his second in command.  There are basic sentence structure errors, an occasional spelling mistake or two, and I kid you not, the name of a starship that Enterprise E under the command of Captain Bateson is supposed to rendevous with for war games changes from the Nora Andrews one page to the Nora Nicholas just a few pages later (and remains so through the rest of the book).  Like I've just written, Star Trek: The Next Generation - Ship of the Line should have been about the continuing rivaly between Bateson and Koraza.  This story could have been similiar to the Next Gen episode "The Wounded" with the USS Phoenix, which tells of the story about another starship captain and the Cardassians.  Switching things around, what could have been a real read of a story about a stoic and somewhat famous Starfleet captain and his rival a Klingon Commander unintenionally bringing both powers to the brink of war as they work against each other.  Having to be quickly and delicately interceeded upon by Captain Picard and the untested Enterprise E.    However what we get is overall several pages at the beginning of this story, a few in the middle and a few at the end.   Inter-mingled with pages of our previously mentioned holographic Captain Kirk.  Ironically the only character with which anytime is spent, however briefly, is Koraza whom were led to believe believes that he beat Captain Bateson, not knowing what had really happened, but whose plans for the destruction of Starbase 12 were ultimately quashed by Captain Kirk. Has since been living a life of dishonor with his crew on a survey ship.  Lastly to add insult to injury, as if just to give Captain Picard something to do it seems, that a Cardassian POW camp is thrown in. But the author fails to even hint at the Federation/Klingon/Romulan war against the Dominion.  And has the gall to write that Picard can travel to Cardassia at the height of war, and insist upon the return of prisioners.  To which Picards Cardassian torturer (see yet another Next Gen episode) calmly agrees to as if it were nothing.  This would be akin to General Norman Schwartzkophf(sp), simply going to to Baghdad during the first Gulf War in 1991, asking for the Iraqis to return their colation prisoners, and with little fan fare the Iraqis agreeing.  And lastly Koraza, a traidiontal Klingon, ultimately rolling over because he, figuratively speaking, see's the errors of his ways.    Ship of the Line Degnerates into a real mess of a novel.  Ramptant with so many things going on that nothing gets done. Seriously poor character portrayals and writing that a freshman in high school would be ashamed of.  Don't bother reading this book, because you'll be dissappointed like I was.  If you've recently purchased this book, then take it back and use your money for something else.  If you're just bent on reading this book, check it out from your local library like I did.  Then that way you won't feel bad when you see just how bad this story is, because you won't have actually paid for this book then.  KB 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 check out (...)and see for yourself.  great site by the way if you're really interested in getting into real estate and don't buy into all these garbage gurus on tv who want you to spend thousands of dollars to learn unethical and possibly illegal techniques to buy and sell real estate.    in any case, if you need motivation, check out russ' books.  if you want a real how to with the good and the bad check out john's site.  it's a real eye-opener 
 I received a textbook clearly and boldly marked:  "WILEY INTERNATIONAL EDITION. RESTRICTED! NOT FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES.   I promtly sent email regarding this warning but got no reply. I think this is the poorest service i have ever received from an online textbook vendor. I expect a note to be sent along with order explaining the reason why i was receiving a textbook with such warning, and as if that was not bad enough, my email was ignored. I will do my best to warn fellow students of this poor service and utter disregard for business etiques. If there was a zero star, this vendor diserve less than that 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture. 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 I did not find this book helpful at all.  I guess I should have known better, but I thought maybe it would have one piece of useful information.  It didn't 
 I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!!  The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.  The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller.   The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works 
 To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:  "This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it."  
 Seasons 1 and 2 of BS were interesting and informative. They would say "Look at this: It's not what you think it is. Let us show you what we mean." Season three was basically Penn saying "Take a look at these idiots." There are a few things in season 3 that ARE informative, but most of it is either obvious "Wow, you mean God ISN'T showing up in grilled cheese?" or opinionated "Hey, I never finished college, and now I'm rich!" And they included more gratuitus nudity just, I assume, to fit into "Showtime."   So yeah, BS has jumped the Shark 
 Gosh, maybe I shouldn't review this book, but then - any book that I bring home that is so difficult to follow that I just couldn't finish it probably deserves one star. While the subject matter was of great interest to me, the writing style was not a comfortable read. I was constantly trying to remember who was who, what time period it had just jumped to and then jumped to again and, worst of all, the flow of the words was simply missing. Hard to pinpoint the problem, but by Page 42 I was so confused and frustrated, not entertained, and wondering why I was working so hard to read it when I had a stack of other promising new works waiting. (Now I'm readin 'A Long Way Down' by Nick Hornby and was mesmerized from the first page. A perfect example of a well-structured story that just glides from page to thought-provoking page. My full review to be posted shortly. 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 I was somehow forced to rate the book one star, because there is no possibility of rating it with  none. However, and in second thoughts, this book *is* worth at least one star, because it will give you a mercyless  insight to what some writers are capable of doing for the money 
 great! jus wat hip hop needs, another idiot comin up talkin bout cars n money. its no wonder nas sez hip hop is dead. unless the real mcs stand up soon, hip hop has no hop 
   I always shake my head and smile when I read Robert B. Parker's novels. That I keep reading them is evidence of his talent as a writer. Even so, after about the first 20 pages, I could not help but notice that Jesse Stone is simply a re-working of the Spenser character. I still hold out the hope that someday, Parker will get over his hangups about conservatives, organized religion, the concept of man and wife, and surburbia. The sub-plot about the right-wing militia was laughable! In Massachusetts of all places?? Parker's blind faith in The Professional Therapist as the god-given solution to all of man's problems is passing out of the annoying phase and is now in the realm of nauseating. Its sad that a man of such talent has such a stunted, fatalistic view of Man. If only Parker can overcome this handicap, he will possibly make the leap from fair to good 
 This movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor.  Are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny?  Sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society.  I'm not a stiff when it comes to humor, but I trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with Fox.  Fox Network is a base for right-wing Republican stupidity.  This movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities.  I think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of American humor have gone.  Hurray for the 1st amendments and others our Four Fathers came up with, I think they were brillant men.  I am all for Free-Speech but I believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public.  This film definitely over stepped its boundaries.  For all those people who loved this movie...why are there sooooo many (around 180) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago!?!?!  I thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto...Just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents 
 Here are some noteworthy tutorials perhaps you may find a use for, even though I did not: DVD mockup, Book mockup, Grudge Effect, Making a Photo Look Old. The best tutorials are by Felix Nelson, because they are original and unique. Scott Kelby's stuff is kitsch. He copykats what graphic designer's are doing today and recreates a cheap knock-off tutorial for this book. Best Buy, American Pie's Logo, etc. Why the hell would I want to make a logo that looks just like American Pie's logo? Or a logo that looks just like EA Sport's logo? How trite. But if that's your thing to steal, mimic, and make crappy versions of the original then go ahead. I used to respect Kelby, mmm not so much anymore. Anything for a buck and reproduce filler garbage for the masses. I pity anybody who uses this for commercial purposes or for anything that the public will see 
 The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery.  Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off. 
 The book may be easy to read and a good overview of the ZONE diet plan, but...  the first recipe I've tried, vegetarian lasagna, turned out to be a disaster.  To begin with, the ingredient list is faulty.  It calls for 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, but in the procedure, you only use 3  teaspoons.  It then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth -  what cottage cheese - it was never on the ingredient list?   Finally,  right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your  assembling the noodles, etc. - IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE PAN.  So much for  40/30/30 for tonight's dinner and the two hours in the kitchen.  The recipe  was a good idea and I'm interested in a solution if you ever read this Ms.  Gittleman 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 This magazine just dares people to pick the most boring, pretentious, or ostentatious feature within any given issue. "Town & Country" is an extremely old money venture, and while it does have some good and useful articles (and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford,) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly.   "Town & Country" was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture, two areas I have great interest in. As an applicable aside, when I read a list of tips in the offshoot "Town & Country Travel" publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights, I realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to Europe or Asia costs.  As I mentioned, there are some good articles, and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like "Town & Country Travel" that are eminently more readable (although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast, etc.) I will say that the photography is always good, and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available: Hyacinth Bucket would, no doubt, like to be seen reading this magazine.   Despite having occasionally worthwhile features, I find "Town & Country" to be excessively pompous, therefore I recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have, whether it is fashion, society, or travel. 
 There is a difference between religion and culture, and although it is often difficult to tease them apart, the effort should be made. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has not made much of an attempt in her book, which seems to blame Islam for the shortcomings of Somali culture when it comes to women - and, worse, to imply that Somalia is typical of the Islamic world, which is so diverse that a 'typical' country cannot be found. Sadly, male oppression of women can be found in most parts of the world, including those with no connection to Islam - and men have often twisted religions to justify their treatment of women.   One subject she deals with is that of female circumcision in its most extreme form, that of 'female genital mutilation' or FGM. She is correct that FGM is practiced in Somalia, but incorrect in ascribing this custom to Islamic influence. She does point out that FGM preceded Islam, and started in Africa, but doesn't take pains to note that it possibly dates back to ancient Egypt (hence the alternate name of 'Pharaonic circumcision'), and is unknown in most of the Islamic world but practiced in some African countries by animists and Christians as well as Muslims.  I am uncomfortable with her writing as a spokesperson for Muslim women, since she doesn't seem to know much about Islam. Incredibly, she doesn't even seem to have read the Qur'an, since she states that Prophet Muhammad wrote about female circumcision in that book. Leaving aside the question of the source of the Qur'an (if she thinks it was written by the Prophet as opposed to being revealed by God, she is no longer a Muslim), the Qur'an in fact never mentions circumcision at all, even male circumcision.  There are also no authentic hadiths (traditions of the Prophet) in which he talks of female circumcision.  It disturbs me that Muslim or formerly Muslim women who write books criticizing Islam are immediately lionized in the West, no matter how uninformed these people are. It seems that some Westerners who are already hostile to Islam latch onto these people to support their own prejudices. Others simply don't realize that people like Ali are not necessarily reliable on the subject of the religion.  I agree with another reviewer that it would be a better idea to read books by feminists with a deep knowledge of Islam, such as Dr. Leila Ahmed, born and brought up in Egypt and now a professor at Harvard's Divinity School. She too speaks of the oppression of women, but in a more nuanced and informed way. Two of her books are "Women and Gender in Islam" and "A Border Passage," the latter the story of her own life in Egypt, England, Abu Dhabi, and the U.S. and the evolution of her thought on feminism and her religion 
 This is a history of packaging, not the psychology of packaging as I expected.  Thus, I found it entertaining in places and terribly boring in others.  If you are interested in packaging, from its origins to its impact on the environment, then this books does the trick.  If you are fascinated in pop culture, then I would pass 
 If you are in the kindergarden and you need a book, take this on 
 Very esoteric, helpful if your having and argument about the physics of sound....  Old, out of date pictures and test instruments. Some of which haven't been around for ten years. Very little practical information, you read and read and read looking for some practical conclusions.  Absolutely FILLED with mathematical calculations. I'm not put off by these but they are out of balance with there usefulness.  This books seems like it was written to fulfill someones PHD requirements.  There are some useful chapters on electrical or speaker basics but they seem included only to bring this book down from outer space 
 An exceptionally nasty hatchet job, sloppily written, relying heavily on the authorized biography by Robert Whelan.  Not surprisingly, Cornell Capa, the biographee's brother and custodian of his heritage refused cooperation, even to the extent of denying the use crucial photos, with this author 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 I have watched a lot of horror movies in my lifetime.  There are some great and original films in this genre, and there are some that are just plain terrible. This movie definitely falls into the 'terrible' category. I don't remember watching the first of the sequel. I didn't pay to watch this movie, and it was like watching a vhs tape so i fast forwarded through a lot of it cuz i figured i'd just 'waste' less time.  I can't believe Bruce Springsteen's sister acts in this. He must be humiliated by it as she can't act!  The acting overall, as in many of the camper type horror movies, is horrendous!  Got 90 minutes to "waste"? Like stupid horror movies with really bad acting? Then by all means, watch this stinker.   However, Angela(the killer and The Boss's sis) certainly found some very interesting and original ways to kill people.  Also, the scene where she is fishing and pulls up a hockey mask is sort of funny, as I'm sure it was meant to be.  It seemed fitting and almost makes this film look like more of a spoof of the genre as opposed to an actual scary movie. The acting is terrible, all the characters are morons, but wait there's more! If you like nudity, you will at least get to see some half naked women.   I am still willing to give the first 'sleepaway camp' a viewing after hearing that it's a good horror movie 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false.  The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents.  Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them "again" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.  In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK.  But this is a mainstream legal thriller.  It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason.  But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is 
 The book is most helpful, but a little out of date with regards to moderm PLL techniques, especialy charge pump o/p types and makes no referance to lead lag passive filter loops. This hinders the usefulness of the enclosed program which would benefit from a 'modernisation 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)?   If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse?   And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path? 
 I read this book quickly and probably won't use it again before we remodel the kitchen.  This is the fifth book I've read on kitchens and I purchased this one based on the reviews here.  Like another reviewer said, this book is a handy companion if you are needing some design ideas and plan on working with a designer in the future.  I guess I was expecting more substance.  The authors try really hard to be funny. They are also assuming their audience is female.  I didn't enjoy this approach and found the writing boorish.  There are some useful things in the book, but these things are far and few between.    My favorite book so far is "Great Kitchens: Design Ideas from America's Top Chefs".   
 Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other "literary" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too "literary" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story. 
 This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it. 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 I can't say I read this whole book, because, I started to read it and found from a markets perspective I couldn't agree with much of what it said.  That probably applies to T/A in general, mind, not just this book.  However, it does confirm that this book isn't really managing to sell T/A.  There are too many qualifications about indicators and rules which if you take on, rather than ignore, make some of these systems no better than a crack-pot lottery system.  Also, having dipped into various chapters there seem to be cases of things only being glossed over, such as candlesticks.  Much cases, of may, might, probable, etc.  If you want to get rich quick, first learn how to do the DD and value analysis.  Then use T/A if you must to provide some support to your entry and exits into investments, but do not invest on the basis of charts alone.  You may win some, and then lose some, and win some, and lose some, and lose some, and over time, unless lucky, you'll probably lose some more than you win some.  Of course, there are lucky people.  Don't take these people as being statistically representative of whether T/A works or not!  Sorry; the book doesn't do it for me, though I'm quite positive there will be more succint books produced by sharper traders which will act as better guides 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 This was sent from Nextar as a replacement for a defective MacVision MP3 I ordered for my daughter, it took 3 weeks to send in the original(they don't return calls in 48 hours as their voicemail states) and then it took another 3 weeks for them to get me a replacement(which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing).  For about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did(would not play a full song and then goes into a starting 'loop').  I would not buy another product from this company 
 Another book that I had high hopes for, only to be let down. I was looking for some real insider secrets from a leading engine builder. I spent 10 years in the engine rebuilding business and now do it only as a hobby. I am always on the lookout for great books on the subject. This book is not one of them. Smokey Yunick's Power Secrets is a much better buy, although it doesn't talk about fuel injection. If you are a beginner in the engine building world, then by all means read this book, then read Smokey's Power Secrets 
 I wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun.  Instead, I found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people.  Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's "fiesty, independent and outspoken", she is repeatedly referred to as "difficult to HANDLE" and "a real handful".  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be "handled"?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really "met her match" in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his "faults" to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY 
 I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars 
 Absolutley no help for the lazy students, this book is filled with foolish stratigies that only help semi-enthused students make class more enjoyable. The techniques found in the book require at a fair amount of interest in a class. In no way could this book help a student that isnt motivated to work in school. For example, the first section is filled with ways to con a teacher into devoting their time into a mindless/useless class discussion. In what way is this motivating 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 Poor quality. One of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times. 
 The fact that this book is still being read is a testimony to the tenacious nature our culture's fascination with cults and the unwavering campaign of anti-cult organizations to maintain the belief that there is such a thing as brainwashing. Margaret Singer's theory was deemed "unscientific" 20 years ago by the American Psychological Association. She was banned from giving testimony is US court because her ideas were not supported by the field of psychology and were not even congruent in their own assertions. Not one credible empirical study has supported her theory while many have effectively demonstrated that being part of a small religious movement has a neutral or positive affect on one's mental health. All of the Psychology of Religion text books I have read refer to Brainwashing and mind control as a debunked theory. I am doing my dissertation on the subject and have just done a large search of the research so I am fairly certain of these facts. I also want to note that Singer's theories and court appearances justified and supported the kidnaping, and violent "deprogramming" of hundreds of adults. Singer's "vast experience" treating ex-cult members was almost entirely made up of people who had been deprogrammed AND who had emotional issues. This can hardly be considered a representational group. There has be no further research to support the claims Singer makes and at least one study (Lewis and Bromley, 1987) indicated that Only those ex-cult members who has been deprogrammed or receive "exit counseling" by anti-cult organizations showed signed of emotional problems after leaving the groups. These facts should be considered when reading such a book. In my opinion this book is an unscientific and bigoted text which uses the horrible violence perpetrated by a very few groups (i.e. Jonestown etc.) to justify slandering hundreds of small religious movements and thier memebers. For a complete history of the phenomenon of brainwashing I recommend James Lewis or Gordon Melton's work including and article that can be found online called "Brainwashing and the Cults: The rise and fall of a theory.  
 By the time I came to this movie, I had already gotten there first three. Up in Smoke was fantastic, Next Movie was great, Nice Dreams was good, this was was pretty poor. They get pretty desparate at some points here, and they constantly repeat chracters we've seen already. The Low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals (badly), the astronaut which is Cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space, and then pretentds to jerk off at the end. Also, when they got to "Harry Palms" masterbating Champion, that was about as low and unfunny as you could get, just awful. All the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long, including the fake nightclub. The people laughing at Cheech doing a redneck, had to have been payed actors. There are some good points... not that many though. Maybe the wrestling scene, and some of the scene with Chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room. They don't seem to do much in this. I wanted something different, which is what I got, but I didn't think it would be this horrible. These guys can do better. 
 The program crashed during Setup. When I finally got it installed, it crashed my machine every night until I uninstalled it. 
 This is not so much an encyclopedia as it is an encyclopedic religious polemic.  Its "Topical Index"  contains an entry on almost every Christian sect in America from the Quakers to the Romans, but not a single reference to any branch of Judaism, (or any other non-Christian faith for that matter). However, atheism, paganism and cannibalism DO get their own entries! Go figure.    There are few quotes in here from non-Christians. No Jewish Supreme Court Justices, or Jewish statesmen or Jewish military leaders are quoted, but  Conrad Hilton, a Christian hotel manager and playboy gets half a page. Non-Christians like Albert Einstein  only get a couple of short,  out-of-context blurbs.   If you agree with folks at Amerisearch, the publishers of "America's God and Country" and believe that the Founding Fathers were just joking around about the First Amendment. then you will have no problem with this book.  But if you need a more inclusive  reference work on the religious, and philosophical fabric of the United States, move on, this one has tunnelvision. It is very biased, to the point of creepy, with gaping omissions and therefore too compromised to be useful as a legitimate reference. Perhaps in the next edition they'll have a nice quote from Paris Hilton 
 The text is wordy and often redundant.  Some issues are discussed with far too much detail and reiteration while others are statements without meaningful diatribe.    I did enjoy the historical presentations but the spiritual presentations were difficult to cull through and not very enlightening 
 I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda.  That being said, in this book, Mr. DiLorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts (or at least with his conclusions).  The flyleaf of this book promises "extensive research and meticulous documentation" but at least one other reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this author's historical research.  That should raise a red flag to anyone reading this book.   Consider this:  The author claims Lincoln was more interested in building an American "empire" by centralizing Federal power than ending slavery.  This implies Lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as President.  I challenge anyone who believes that to read Lincoln's actual words and, more importantly, examine his actions.  This we know:  Abraham Lincoln was a complicated man and, as a thoughtful person, his views on slavery changed during his many years in public life.  He came to believe that slavery would not die out on its own.  I do recommend purchasing and reading this book since it is so different from the mythical view we have of Lincoln today.  However, when it comes to some of the "facts" and conclusions expounded in this book be very careful what you believe 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she used to have the It's A wonderful Life in color on VHS.I recored over this VHS about 5 years ago, and i have felt terrible ever since. AMazon said that this edition was in color, so i decided that this was a perfect gift for my mom. I received the DVD today, and i am so dissapointed that it is not color? Why did they tell us it wasn't 
 Leo the Late Bloomer occupies a dusty, terrifying shelf in one of the furthest reaches of my memory.    To a child who is already depressed and uncertain, Leo offers no solace.  I found him pathetic, and because I was like him, I found myself pathetic all the more.  Leo is the prisoner who escapes while the others languish.  He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about.  It's nice for Leo that he "bloomed," but the child is still miserable.  You think I am kidding.  I wish I was.    I do not blame the book per se, though.  With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.  But read alone, on the floor of an otherwise empty room, with no one to translate the allegory, it only tightens the noose.  
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable. 
 Where are the critiques? The articles lack any critical substance. Whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed. It doesn't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype, VIBE will go along with the flow. On top of that, there are more ADs now than ever before. Even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space. 
 The unit is supposed to have a projection LED. The manual states that "When the unit is plugged into AC outlet, the projection alarm will continuously project the time."  This does not happen. What good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock, find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out?  How do you trust a company like this 
 Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. "Naked", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song "All Because Of You", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, "Naked" & "Sex Wit You" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY) 
 I was excited to read this book, and then  I read the first paragraph. This book is a horrible bore. But I have been forced to read it for summer reading. If your not required to read this book, Don't. 
 I started by lifting the handle to open the machine. I then tried closing it again without anything inside, just to see how it worked. I couldn't push the handle back down. A little frustrated, I thought that perhaps it was a safety device that wouldn't allow you to trap your fingers, so I grabbed a potato to experiment with. Unfortunately, unless you use baby potatoes, they don't fit into the machine anyway. I find it hard to understand how this item can be called a "potato cutter", when it doesn't. I tried all sorts of things in the cutter and nothing would allow me to push the handle back down. I finally used a screwdriver to lever the contraption shut, just to enable me to put it back in the box for a full refund 
 Book is kinda funny, but could have seriously benefitted from the attentions of a better illustrator.  The gag just get's old without some more exciting visual support.  *yawn 
 I didn't think this book was well-written and any different from another book called The Adonis Complex, which was much more interesting and focused. From what I understand, the authors of the Adonis Complex were the original doctors behind many of the studies Luciano discusses, including the GI Joe study. I suggest picking up The Adonis Complex if you want a better understanding of this problem in men 
 Without a doubt, this is the worst movie ever made, in any genre, in any decade, by any movie making company since the begining of motion pictures. Who ever put Sandra Bullock's image on the cover of the DVD should be arrested for false advertising, since Sandra is only in the movie a few minutes, and isn't very good in her role anyway. What a bomb, and that's an understatement. Don't rent it, don't buy it, and don't ever watch it, unless you are completely without anything to do, and want to find out for yourself just how bad a movie can be 
 This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful.  If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"  (Stathis).  It makes this book looks like preschool. 
 I usually like James Patterson but this book was absolutely horrible. Not only was it hard to follow, but I never ended up caring about any of the characters. I can't believe he was able to get this published AND win an award. I guess I just don't get it 
 If you are looking for accuracy and durability do not by this product 
 I've written to the National Audubon society and several geologists concerning an omission in this book.   I can't remember when Michael Landon and I discovered our mutual love of geology, but it remained a constant in our friendship. Shortly before he began to film for his finest role as Jonathan Smith in "Highway to Heaven", Michael Landon and I embarked upon a geological survey of Northern Canada. Using his celebrity influence, Michael Landon was granted a royal charter from Franz Joseph II, then Prince of Liechtenstein, to finance any mining capital should we discover a new gem to add to the Prince's famous gem-trunk.   We eventually found a quiet piece of land within the traditional lands of the Nis'gl't'k people. After spending seven months documenting and learning their language I anglicised their name. The "Huxtable people" spoke of a cave famous in their stories for being the home of N'gaask'ul'k'ot, or "Gelman." Instinctively, Michael Landon went there, to Gelman's cave. He refused to use anything but a 10 inch hunting knife when quarrying. He furiously knifed at the cave wall for 4 or 6 hours without any apparent consistency to where his knife struck. Suddenly the cave stank. I looked at Michael Landon with contempt, but to my surprise his face was not sheepish. I wondered then where the smell came from. I followed his peepers, and he was using them to look at a gem that lay before his fallow blade. We both knew what we had discovered, but we consulted our Audubon guide. It wasn't listed. In his excitement, Michael Landon first suggested naming it "stinkrock", then "stankrock" and finally "smellrock." I took on a soothing tone to pacify him and delicately suggested we call it the "Landonquicklyite." He put a single finger to his pursed lips, furrowed his brow, squatted, started walking around while squatting, and then eagerly said "let's call it Michael Landon's Rock." Kenneth Waltz later characterised our relationship as having a power imbalance, probably a reason why the gem came to be known among us and in some geological circles as "michaellandonsrock."  In weight comparable to the density of those memories, I still have 10 pounds of michaellandonsrock. I even put some in the rock tumbler and they look nice.   So, perhaps my review is biased, but I hope that in the future the Audubon Society will investigate my claim. 
 The whole thing is ALOT smaller than you think it's going to be.  The base is smaller than the palm of your hand.  The Butterflies don't stick to it like the picture.... the first ones stick to the base well enough, but you can't build it like you see in the picture.  My 4 yr old lost interest quickly and I'm sure the butterflies are all scattered around her room by now.  I'm disapointed in this toy... you don't get what you pay for, that's for sure!!  
 The most boring business book I have read.  After 95 pages, I have yet to gain any 'nuggets' and am disappointed with the poor standard of writing.  Not only does Mr Cooper fail to provide actual step by step examples where his process has been followed successfully, quoted statistics are unhelpful and are clearly provided solely to support his case.   One extract from the book (page 16/17) tells all:  "We find the average success rate of developed products to be about 67%.  But averages often fail to tell the whole story: This success rate varies from a low of 0% to a high of 100%, depending on the company!"   I don't think one has to read a book to know that statistic! Much of what Cooper writes is common sense and I believe of little value to a dynamic organisation wishing to promote the internal development of breakthrough products and their succesful launch thereafter. I cannot believe that there are not better books available on this subject 
 When I am sick, I don't want to wade through this book at all......there are many mistakes. I had the shock of my life recently.....I had a mild cold and took the standard remedies given by my herbal "doctor". I didn't get better and got very sick almost to the point of being in the hospital. Luckily, my family medical doctor treated me and also prescribed a potent Rx.  Within 24 hours I felt much better! None of the alternate treatments and herbal medicines worked at all! The bill from the herbal "doctor" and all the medicines and treatments he gave me was MORE than the visit to my Family medical doctor and his treatments !!!!! Thanks Doc 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was a book written by a Satanist. The author seems to be rejoicing in the prospect of armageddon, including mountains being blown up and the destruction of all the world's cities. I bought a tatty copy for one penny and I was somewhat surprised to see that by 1973 it was on its 27th printing. It seems reasonable then to assume that Mr Lindsey's views are fairly representative of mainstream America.   If that's the case then that suggests that plenty of Americans are keen for armageddon to erupt in the Middle East so that the "good Christians" may be whisked off for a private audience with J. Christ while the rest of the population burns.   I would recommend this book to all Israelis. In his book The Last Days of Israel, Zionist author Barry Chamish declared that Israel's main enemies were European Socialists. Well, I reckon that Hal Lindsey and his fans present a greater threat. It seems likely that if the supposed Temple of Solomon is not rebuilt and Israel isn't annihilated then a lot of committed Christians are going to be most upset. The bit of "good news" in Lindsey's book is that the surviving Israelis will convert to Christianity with such passion that they will be like "144,000 Billy Grahames".   It seems that committed Christians are in charge of both the UK and US governments and that the US government could be described as a theocracy. I wonder if the theocrats share the views of Mr Lindsey, who states in this book that each Arab generation hates Israel more than the one before, which would be good news as it would mean that they would be more likely to attack and initiate armageddon and cause the return of Jesus Christ.  Russia is portrayed as the villain of the book, but "Red China" and the "Red Chinese" get a look-in in a chapter entitled "The Yellow Peril".   The book however does contain one true statement, on page 120: "Religion is a great blinder of the minds of men." and frankly, I hope "the rapture" does happen soon. The sooner that people like Hal Lindsey are whisked off the face of the Earth, the greater the likelihood for peace in the world 
 Ostrowski has the potential to write great, readable history. Unfortunately that's all this book shows. This book uses too many references to far to little good. Some chapters (about 20 pages each) have in excess of one hundred references; often there are pages where there are more footnotes than general text.  This just exacerbates his problem with spending several pages talking about what other historians say, and then one or two saying his piece. On the plus side his prose if very clear and to the point when he finally wanders into one 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 Reading this book is like listening to a speach by Bush.  His position is that "reasonable people" will agree with him, and those who don't either miss the point, are "unpatriotic" to his clearly righteous cause, or are just idiots.  If you are interested in this topic, read the summary of the book and the posted comments.  You'll get a good grounding in both sides of the issue - something that the book itself does not provide. 
 I have found Hibernate In Action to be an indispensible guide when developing Hibernate persistence solutions, so I was eagerly awaiting the release of its successor.  Most developers will want to use standard JPA as much as possible for portability reasons, and only use Hibernate where absolutely necessary to use features not supported by JPA.  However this book fails to cleanly separate discussion of JPA from Hibernate, meaning that if you take this approach to using JPA you end up wading through large sections of the 800+ pages of this weighty tome.  I have to agree with Ganeshji and C. Updike - this lack of any clean separation of JPA and Hibernate makes it difficult to get useful information out of the book.  This is a shame, as the writing is of a high standard - unfortunately the content is very poorly organised. 
 While certainly a better presentation than the Rod Stewarts and Michael Boltons of the world and their flaccid stabs at music way different from a rocker's sensibilities, Buble is a standards singer for those who think Kenny G is a jazz musician and John Tesh is a pianist.  There's nothing 'wrong' with listening to him...there are just so many better alternatives.   It's the songs that are great, folks, not the singer. Seek out the people who recorded these songs in the first place, when they had REAL musicians and the best arrangers in the world working with them (a nod to Johnny Mercer, who provided some of Buble's arrangements.)  Want to know the keywords? Sinatra. Darin. Billy May. Nelson Riddle. Peggy Lee. Mel Torme. Tony Bennett. Keely Smith. Johnny Hartman. Anita O'Day. Diane Krall. Gordon Jenkins. Johnny Mercer. Cole Porter. Count Basie.   There are plenty more, but you can find them for yourself.  If you think Buble is Da Man, wait till you try Frank or Bobby Darin. You'll never look back 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery.  Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off. 
 I have been working in the Chinese hospitality industry as a senior manager since 2000. I find the book to be a total waste of time and money to tourism professionals with a little knowledge of China. The statistics and general data available in the book are far too old to be useful. One example: page 150, the Table 10.3 about Hotel Management Companies in China, is from 1998! For the tourism professionals that want to enter this market, I recommend any "how to" book about business in China and the reading of free articles available on the internet. Don't waste your time 
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 As a long-time of fan I was disgusted by both the movie and the book. Jordan tries his hand here but comes way short of the previous books. He should just stick to WOT 
 This book was hard for me to read.  I actually didn't end up finishing it because I thought it wasn't that well written.  
 Claiming to be a book which bridges the divide between the worlds of academia and populism, Japan Pop! gets off to a poor start with an absurdly high cover price likely to put it out of reach of the casual J-Pop Culture fan. The price might have been justified had this been a glossy, photo-packed book, but seems ludicrous given that it is merely a collection of 17 essays. The essays dwell on four major areas of contemporary J-Pop Culture: music, manga and animation, TV & film and the popularity of J-Pop Culture outside of the country. It comes as little surprise that Mark Schilling's contribution, about the Tora-san character in the Otoko wa Tsurai yo (It's Tough Being a Man) film series, is the most interesting - not necessarily because of the topic, but because Schilling is the only contributor who is a writer of any repute. The majority of these essays are written by academics and it shows: footnotes abound, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get analysed to the nth degree and claims are made that "Sailor Moon's rearrangement of the traditional superhero myth bears hints of not only a new social order, but also the kind of moral struggles, alliances, and identities that may create and accompany it." The book also contains a number of confidence-sapping factual errors (example: Osaka band Shonen Knife "started playing in the mid-1980s" which is not true, they started playing in December 1981). Schilling's Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture (Weatherhill) remains the definitive starting point for those seeking a good, accessible introduction to the subject; Japan Pop! is only for the otaku completist, and a wealthy one at that 
 Someone once told me that "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is a decent horror movie.  Boy, was she wrong!!  This movie is a snoozer from a horror movie fan's perspective.  I am not talking about the movie's lack of gore either...I don't care about that.  "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is not a horror movie at all and, is quite frankly, dull as a suspense thriller and/or mystery flick.  True, one wonders about the little girl's father and she is eccentric to say the least, but that's not enough to hold the suspense thriller fan's interest.  "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" is more of a romance movie with a little bit of mystery and is all about an eccentric weird girl who wants to be able to live alone, her way and without any interference from anyone.  That being said, I do not think there is enough here for a suspense thriller much less a horror movie.  True, Jodie Foster is a good actress, but she looks like a freak with her hairdo in this movie.  It is truly sad that you will find "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" in the horror section of video/dvd stores.  No matter what your pleasure is, this movie fails to deliver the goods.  The problem with this movie is that it is simply boring, and not enough action takes place in this movie.  The only viewers that will find this movie to be exceptional are the die-hard Jodie Foster fans.  While I appreciate good acting, there still has to be a compelling enough script to hold one's interest.  I would argue that you do not have this in "Little Girl".  To be perfectly frank, this movie should be called "The Boring Adventures of The Weird Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane and Her Idiot Dorky Little Magician Friend"...that about sums it up 
 There was some great lines and the ending was funny. Still, it was a movie spoofing about itself. It really wasn't all that good. Yes, plenty of celebrities. Still so what? 
 Run Before the Wind was the second book in the Lee series.  At this time, Will Lee IV is in law school and not doing well scholarly.  He decides to take a year off and travel England and Ireland.  In the course of his travels, he meets up with a couple who sail and are in the process of building a boat for a reclusive businessman.  He joins them on their adventure which includes problems with terrorist.  I was disappointed in this book.  It's not the suspenseful, can't put down this book that most of Woods work is, and the book is more of a disappointment after reading Chiefs, the first book in the Lee series 
 Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories.  I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing.  It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of "lecturing" about various and sundry things.  Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books. 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 How the film-makers achieved financing to make this film I'll never understand.  The make-up, costuming, screen-writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing are all over-the-top and way over-done.  It looks like an amateur film-school project.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful--the one bright spot in this film.  For some reason, a film set in the late 19th century had the male lead and entire cast break out singing "The Sound of Music" by Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Someone must have been smoking something illegal that lead to this manic, ridiculous parody? of a musical.  Nowhere did I read a review that said it was a parody and farce; it was supposed to be a musical.  There was no way I could view this film for more than 15 minutes, and that long just to see if the title character would awake from a drug-induced nightmare. I love musicals but this one should definitely be viewed free on television and not rented or bought until you see if you can stand it. Save your money--it is awful.  Note:  If I had read a review such as this, I would have saved myself time and money 
 We just completed the first three books in this ten-book series and are even more frustrated. I can only wonder if any of the reviewers who recommended these books actually read them for content. While reviewers have described her writing as 'telling a story', it is actually rambling on and on over minutia that is unimportant while leaving the truly important parts of history barely written of. Homeschoolers pay for vast collections of educational books and, as a group, we have high standards for what is worth paying $200 for. This series isn't even worth $20.   Time is valuable and the nine months we have spent on the first three volumes was 90% wasted. Hakim jumps from one part of a story to a different part of another story and then returns as though this is part of a natural thought process--it's not. She includes minute details about the way someone's maid or valet dressed and will ramble on for five pages regarding their footwear. While she may be interested in that twaddle, we are not. Most of the chapters are organized around what pictures she found fascinating, rather than actual history. Chapter after chapter, we read about people I would never waste my time on and the comings and goings of everything in their household, from what they ate, to how each person looked in appearance, to (again) their footwear. Aside from an obvious foot fetish, Hakim has nothing substantial to offer and rambles on, book after book, into nothingness. We were saddened to find many famous events given only one sentence (e.g. Shay's Rebellion), while many pages were devoted to insignificance (e.g. over 40 pages per book devoted to large pictures of insignifcant drawings).  The last detail that made this series so disappointing was the obvious slant of Hakim's writing--slamming one framer, while making another out to be a saint. Like those who start a sentence with the words "I'm not prejudice, but...", Hakim starts her books with the preface that she is depicting what happened with no prejudice toward any belief system--not. As homeschoolers, we have learned to read with a critical eye those words that are used to incite an emotion--wasted, hated, dictated, etc.--Hakim uses them much too frequently. Hate words should be removed from history books, they just don't belong.  My children have asked me to add that what they dislike most about this book is that Hakim's definitions are so incredibly inaccurate. Just today, she defined the word paradox so poorly that we had to grab the dictionary to read the correct definition. Oxford should hire a better fact-checker. 
   Ok, I read about 3-4 books a week and this was certaintly not my first by Shannon Drake a.k.a. Heather Graham.  Her normal plot twists keep me on the edge of my seat, prodding me to read on.  And her characters normaly, are well written.  The more I read this book the more I grew in my disappointment!     Brian Sterling "The Beast" seemed to have split personalites.  Borish and mean most of the book and then did a total 180 at the end of the book.  The "love" that came to be between Brian and Camille was forced.  Mrs. Drake needed this to have romance in it and they were their.     Their were to many players in this game and they only added confussion.  The plot was good if it had been written better.  While most chapters rambled, she failed to explain so much.  It was as if she had a deadline to meet and simply threw it together.     Very poorly written.  Do yourself the favor and not bother you will only be left shaking your head in disappointment 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 Unfortunately, this book, and the review of it offered by Ashutosh Chatterji, is more about defending Calcutta from the western view of it than it is about the "cultural and literary history" that is the title of the book.  I bought this book in Calcutta so that I might have a more in-depth history of the place I was visiting.  Instead, I got a book full of opinions and one-sided propaganda.  This is definitely an Indian's nationalistic view of the city of Calcutta and not an objective history lesson, as the book's title advertises.  Whereas Krishna Dutta is indeed a gifter writer, she, or her publishing company, should have come up with a less-misleading title.  Next time, pick up the "History of the Republican Party" by Rush Limbaugh or "The Cultural History of Russia" by Josef Stalin - just kidding of course 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility. As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world. These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom. Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is. At least truth in advertising is in effect here. 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip&hop music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 Having followed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries over the years, I am sorry to say that this volume leaves me wanting... wanting a good mystery!  Ms Brown seems to have dipped into a formula method for compiling her books.  What started the series as bright, witty and compelling, now lacks style, substance and charm.  The animals have become more vocal and unbelievable with each new volume and the sidebars into instructional content and social commentary are too distracting.  Perhaps it's time to put Mrs. Murphy and friends away for a bit until a real plot surfaces 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Bought this book and his other waste of money book (3-Day Diet). Much better books on diet and eating right on Amazon then this trash. Don't waste your money 
 So I'm flipping through the book and thinking "Did I actually pay money for this?".  So many of the activities were things that I (and many other parents) are already doing with our babies.  Like playing with rattles, talking to your baby while looking in the mirror, kicking at toys, pointing to objects and saying the sounds they make, peek-a-boo, waving bye-bye... you get the idea. But the moment I knew I wanted to get my refund was when in the 0-3 months section, the author suggested going to the hardware store to buy a blank set of keys to put on a strong ring to "make great noise and be cool teethers".  The thought of my infant's delicate gums knawing away at the sharp edges of metal keys--YIKES! 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice.     
 This book was a delight at first to read, then it started to use issues that I think were very disgusting and since I am in 8th grade I refused to write my book report on this subject and discuss it in front of my piers. But if you're looking for a book about abortion and sex, this is the book for you 
 Well, I wrote the review about this set, and boy was I disappointed when I got it.  I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters.  1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection.  The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse.  Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!!  I got the set, watched it< and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use.  What a waste of money!! 
 I ordered this book after being put on bedrest for pre-term labor and found the chapter on this subject to be anything BUT encouraging.  The author makes it sound like pre-term labor is a death sentence for your unborn baby because of the experience she had, and according to her, there is virtually no hope of having a baby anywhere near term if you have this condition.  There are other subjects in the book such as Gestational Diabetes, PIH, etc, which are less drear, and I'm sure they are of help to women experiencing these conditions, but as a whole, I was disappointed with this book.  After several chances, I stopped reading this book because of it's bleak outlook on a common pregnancy complication 
 A very disappointing read from an author I admire.  The book creates a dreary and morbid atmosphere, and none of the characters are in the least bit attractive or sympathetic. The plot is slow and convoluted. The insight into the writing process is brief. A waste of time.  
 I read many reviews of this CD that referred to the music as Trip-Hop.  The phrase "Don't believe everything you read" comes to mind immediately.  The music is anything but Trip-Hop.  The second CD is a compliation of re-mixes that makes a faint attempt towards trip-hop, but falls extremely short. If you asked me what the music is like I would tell you that the first CD is "Sweet Music" (a nice female voice accompanied by simple instruments portraying a beautiful day at the local park...almost resembling a sad attempt at pop music.  As a big fan of true trip-hop such as Massive Attack, I was somewhat excited when I began listening to the second CD.  The first track quickly caught my attention and I began to think that my purchase wasn't a total loss.  However, I was quickly dissapointed by the progressive fade of energy as each track drug on.  
 The book is obsolete. Not much info, for a current graduate of computer science or ee or computer engineering. Samples and techniques are obsolete.  Waste of money. don't buy. Probably good for old managers who are not  familiar with embedded system 
 Buy this book and feel like an [fool]!  I was hopeing for a book that would address male issues for those over 40.  What I got was one man's collection of "urban fables" with instructions based on his unique, singular experience.  I struggled through chapters 1 and 2, but the real kiss of death was chapter 3 (Why men feel ashamed of themselves and therefore do not take any interest in health or longevity).  I'm ashamed because I'm not a hunter?  I'm ashamed because I got a circumcision and didn't get a chance to resist?!  Give me a break!  I was going to give the book to my local library, but I don't think I want to be guilty of promulgating this kind of [stuff].  You want to  be healthy over 40  each less junk, exercise regularly, find meaning in your job to insure your efforts make a difference somehow, try and stay connected with friends or make new ones, stay connected with your partner and be supportive and allow to be supported.  There you go, saved you [$] (not including shipping and handling) 
 I gave this book 1 star because it is not the worst, but it is far from the best. This book is not a good book for an undergradute EE student desiring to really learn the subject. Although the author claims that this is a friendly introduction, it is far from that. The first disappointment about this book is the introduction. The author mentioned how difficult the subject is. This in itself is discouraging for any sincere student really wanting to learn the subject. Secondly the coverage of random variables is bad, especially the single random variables. He made two poor decisions, first by seperating discrete and continous random variables. This approach confuses many students,  because most engineering students can understand the calculus more than the dicrete math. If he feels that seperation is necessary then continous random variables should have been presented first. Finally no answers to any of the problems. That is a silly policy, how in the can students get feedback on their progress in the subject. I sincerely hope that professor Yates is not arrogant and will at least consider my comments. Lastly the textbook written by Richard H. Williams is the best ever written on the subject. Many arrogant professors will probably look down on his textbook because he actually teaches and explains the subject better than most 
 ...but I abandoned ship halfway through.  After enjoying the movie, and reading the great praise for author Porter, I assumed I'd enjoy diving into this good, long read.  What I discovered was a rambling and excrutiating book...droning characterization page after page until I could no longer concentrate on the essentially non-existent plot.  I assume this is strictly for fans of Porter, who was a master at short story telling.  She should have stuck to it.  Anyone expecting a "Grand Hotel" or Maugham like saga will be sorely disappointed 
 I experimented with purchasing electronic books with this one. I must say that a search of the net provided far better advanced google search tips than this book. It was not worth the two bucks, period. This author could have done better by doing a google search on google tips and tricks. I do not recommend this book. Search for  "How to really use google" by andrew wroblewski and steve robichaud on the internet...much better and FREE.. 
 Ghosting and static all day, every day. If you need a replacement cable, find one with better shielding 
 Card Studio 2007 has repeated many cards from Card Studio 2006.  I bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed.  Also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched.  You have to pick a card in order to read the front.  Very time consuming 
 I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there 
 The 123 Count With Me video starring Ernie is much better done, with lots of muppet acting and takes the numbers to only 15, but with a personal touch.  That video totals upto 45 minutes of enjoyment for parents and toddler.  This video on the other hand features all of 2 minutes of Elmo, Telly, Gabi and another child. There is not coherent plot -- i.e. while they start off with a video game premise, they just throw together all of the skits on numbers, and never have the muppets appear to actually lead in each script.  After a while of random skits on half the numbers, Elmo or Telly makes a brief aimless appearance.  And even stranger, there is an unexplained scary cookie chasing them. This approach quickly turns off both the parents and the toddlers who wait for glimpses of their favorite characters. Pass on it.  AND the DVD version is made without any extras, such as subtitles, or sing-alongs etc 
 I really did not like Producers at all.  The cast recording was just boring...nothing new or original and nothing that really grabs you and leaves you stunned and speachless.  Oh actually I take that back I was speechless by how terrible this was.  To me there isn't anything funny about the Nazis and what they did and to me it's too bad so many people love this immoral show.  I was repulsed by how terrible is was and I never need to listen or see it again.  
 I personally really didn't enjoy this book. It was a waste of my time. Who really cares about his life. My teacher assigned the book and i was forced to read it. It was pain. I think he could of made it more interesting but unfortunately he had a very dull life. My teacher compared this book to Boy and in my mind there is no comparison. BOY was great book and Knots in my yo yo string was definatly not. I enjoyed reading boy but HATED reading knots in my Yo Yo string. IF you want to read a book i would definately recommend Boy and not Knots in my yo yo string. Thank you for your tim 
 Steven Seagal keeps making films. In 2005 alone, he made as many as four films, which itself sounds an amazing feat. Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues.  Steven Seagal plays one Harlan Banks, ex-master thief who is retiring from his job. Banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in Las Vegas, but because of the robbery committed by someone else, he is arrested and sent to a jail. Is he framed? Of course, he is, but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail, and meets and enlists a help from someone named Ice Kool there (played by Treach), there is nothing to worry about.   But I had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film. We see a glimpse of one orphanage (briefly twice), but no one in the film seems to remember it. The film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of Harlan sees (played by Mari Morrow) in her dream that portends death and danger, but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film. There is a detective played by Sarah Buxton, whose motive to get close to Banks remains unclear, and Nick Mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as Agent Saunders.  [DULL, DULL, DULL] The most impressive part of `Today You Die' is one car chase scene in Las Vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork. In fact, these scenes are recycled footages from one Sidney J. Furie actioner `Top Of the World' starring Peter Weller and Dennis Hopper (yes, I checked it yesterday). The rest of `Today You Die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between Seagal's character and others, which goes like:   BODYGUARD: "Who are you?!" SEAGAL: `Girl scout of America.'   Naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by Seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket, who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles, which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `Above the Law.'  The film is strictly for the avid fans of Seagal, but I am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year. I like his films in the 80s and 90s, and I admit `Today You Die' is not as bad as `The Foreigner,' but that isn't saying much 
 I'm very glad that the more literate types exult over this book.  I was not impressed.  Full disclosure: I've been reading all sorts of speculative fiction for over 45 years, and I've gotten pretty picky, and perhaps more than a little snobbish.  Riddley Walker, an uber-precocious 12-year old, wanders around southeastern England roughly 4400 A.D.  In Riddley's world, they scorn A.D. as "all done," and have reached 2347 O.C. ("our count") after the nuclear war and the Bad Times.  I can well imagine that Anthony Burgess enjoyed surfing on Riddley's broken English narration, some of which is quite amusing ("curse roads" for cross roads).  If you read it out loud, Hoban's work is nowhere near as difficult as "A Clockwork Orange."  The book reminds me more of Edgar Pangborn's "Davey," which was also a much-praised post-apocalypse novel, but in the course of which nothing much happened.  It does bug me just a little bit that they don't know how to say "Canterbury" any more, but refer to the various "tracks" they travel by the common, modern highway numbers, like the A20.  Make no mistake: for the most part, Mr. Hoban imagines this world in breadth and in depth.  If you're looking for that sort of atmosphere, you've come to the right place.  If you're looking to build to a meaningful climax, though, you will perhaps be as disappointed as I was.  In the fullness of this story, two things of old are revived.  Mr. Punch is reborn, though "Punch and Judy" is now "Punch and Pooty," Pooty being a lascivious pig.  Despite some serious miscalculations, it also seems that gunpower is about to be rediscovered.  On that score, I would refer anyone to H. Beam Piper's "Gunpowder God," aka "Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen."  I started this novel once, years ago, and threw it aside.  This time I plowed through the whole thing, and wound up feeling I'd wasted my time.  So, what's your opinion 
 This purchase was done by my husband.(Need I say more, ladies?) This soup(if you can even call it that) was a waste of money. There was hardly any seafood in it at all, and what little there was, it was in small pieces. It was more like 'cream in a can'. My son and husband are both big soup eaters, and love chowder. Let's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day! I will admit that I didn't try it...it didn't smell or look appealing. But if my husband (the human garbage can) says it's awful stuff, I take his word for it....and so should you! 
 I take this title form the video store thinking in Wynton Marsalis. When I was watching the DVD I can appreciate that the image is very good (not great, and I have a 720p tube TV) and the sound is very good also(not great, I have a reference equipment). But the show is so boring¡ Look, you just desire this man stop to blow. The drum's solo is just awesome, but the rest of the show is to forgive about it 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 Was disappointed in the ideas.  Seemed to be more of an extension of the author's collections, than ideas for the reader. Scanned the book it and put it on the shelf, won't be one that I use as a constant reference 
 No a very good video.  Poor quality.  Hard to follow.  Very much a cheat copy of the movie Gettysburg.  
 Jennifer Lopez is a has been and Jane Fond is has been had too many times.  The "stars" just refuse to retire and enjoy their money.  Jane, get married again and drift off into oblivion.  Jen, take some of your millions and open a finishing school for underprivileged hispanic girls, something like Saint Operah is doing for her people.  The world would be a better place if the privileged would spread their wealth around.  Anyway, the movie is your standard schlock that the movie industry is grinding out these days since they ran out a talent about 10 years ago.  enjoy 
 This was just an awful book. I guess the reality of Bennington's life depressed me. I liked High Maintenence better. Waste of my time 
 The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society 
 I fell in love with the art work of the Miss Spider books and bought a few for my son.  When we saw this book at the library I figured it was another good book in the series.  I was wrong.  The content of this book is definately not aimed at children.  It hints at intimacy that young children don't need to be exposed to and some of the pictures are rather scary.  I stopped halfway through the book, noticing some of the pictures.  They could very likely give a child nightmares.  Children do not need to be exposed to this content and violence depicted in the story.  Let's keep them young a little while longer yet please 
 This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to "he says" "she says" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean. 
 This reads like a book rushed into print not long after war in Iraq was declared officially over by the President.  As noted by others here, much of it is pastiche history of the agency seemingly slapped together rather haphazardly.  The rest of it is a genuflection to Georges Tenet and Bush.  What caught my eye is that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are a given in the author's view up until second to last chapter, where their absence is dismissed rather cavalierly 
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers.  However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone.  In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless.  I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed.   Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection 
 The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off.  Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.)  This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 Do not waste your time or money, see the original. Once in awhile, a remake of a movie from another culture works; for example, Seven Samurai becomes "Magnificant Seven" -- Most of the time, the remake is trash. The original "La Femme Nikita" is a great movie: exciting with a strong political viewpoint; this version is simply Hollywood pablum 
 This is the epitome of lame 80's music!  Everything about this CD is pathetic!!  I hate the '80's just because of the ambigious cheese that Wham represents.  Thank god they are no longer around.  Listen to some Pantera if you would like some real music 
 There is a certain pose in these poems, and it is quite effective as poses go, but Buddhism is not a pose, nor a cloak for anger, nor a disguise for preening, and these well-made poems have a hollow core as if the empty kettle had belched. Sorry. I had really wanted to like it 
 This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 This does not get hot enough to boil water (no matter how long I leave it on). Makes it useless. Why bother with a burner if only possible heat setting is "low" and "lower"?  Some customers found that it worked initially, before developing its problem. As to my experience: I don't have memory of mine ever working properly. I bought this a few years ago, and had it in storage, not having need for it at that time. Then I pulled it out last month, for basically its first use. No boil water. No go. It is straight to the landfill for it.   Annoying disappointment. 
 No matter how bad a book seems to start off, I try to give it at least 100 pages before I write it off. That sentence alone should tell you all you need to know, as far as my experience goes. I got to page 125, finally calling it quits 25 pages beyond my own minimum, having had enough to satisfy myself that it had little chance of getting better. I'm not sure it's bad, so much as it's...well, I guess I have to say it's bad. It's a bad book. What he tries to do with this book and what he accomplishes are such different entities, I have to believe the end result is not what the author thought he was getting. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this book to anyone.  This is not to say that it's all bad, because it's not. There are some moments in the story when I found myself genuinely interested. Yet those moments are a pebble in this pond of non-intrigue. Toted as a modern day Tom Robbins by some, it is painfully clear that the author is trying to write in the same style as Robbins. It's also painfully obvious that he fails miserably at doing so.  It may turn out that the remainder of this book was excellent. I guess I'll never know since, as I mentioned above, I gave up after 125 pages. But I have my doubts. I wasn't about to torture myself further to find out. I'm not Ferdinand Magellan. I don't have endless hours of time to waste exploring apparent waste lands in the hope that something comes of it. Perhaps waste land is a bit strong, perhaps not. The book is silly, which I'm not adverse to given that I read Adams and Moore and, as mentioned, Robbins. However, this goes beyond silly, which turns out to be just plain dumb. It's a fine line, which the author isn't able to toe.  I'm turned off by this tendency to write off silliness as a foregone conclusion, as the author does here. The segues from one 2-sentence paragraph to the next don't flow, which makes sitting down for more than 3 minutes an effort. This was yet another problem I had with the book. It appears the author doesn't want you to sit down and digest any more than 2 pages at a time. I sat down one day to try and bite off a solid 50 pages, which is the day I tossed the book aside for good.  There are scores of books better than this one, assuredly. Books by Tom Robbins, Douglass Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, or Christopher Moore come to mind. I suggest going out and finding one of them before picking this up 
 Numb Toes. That's what I wanted to learn about. I Read the book, tons of information on Peripheral Neuropathy but very little about toe numbness. Index only lists numbness on page 17. There in one paragraph I found numbness mentioned twice 
 What a disappointment! Boosting Immunity is a collection of chapters by different authors that is poorly focused and lacks continuity. There is nothing new in this book. It is mostly a rehash of commonly available information and some of the chapters, like chapter two, read like they were copied out of an enclyclopedia. The most attractive thing about this book is the title. Save your money 
 Time Enough For Love is one Heinlein's most famous books and is representative of his writing style, pacing and world view.  He touches upon many sociological subjects and tackles a number of interesting subjects and taboo mostly related to sex, incest the meaning of love.  That being said, after having his "big three" (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Moon is A Harsh Mistress and TEFL) I personally don't enjoy his work, I can understand why I'm in the minority.  TEFL follows the eternal Lazarus Long through his numerous adventures as he recounts his life while looking for reason to continue living.  The novel is divided up into four main sections uneven in length in quality.  There are times when Heinlein is right on target, examining social constructs, where they came from and how we deal with them.  Then there are times when there isn't much going on.  I think my two biggest problems with the novel were its structure and main character.  The makeup of the novel didn't lead to enough events happening nor did it produce any type of conflict normally needed to produce tension.  The novel is extensively dialogue driven and Shakespeare this is not.  Asimov got it right by mixing dialogue driven characters with at least some action but there is really very little going on in TEFL.  The one story that has some semblance of dramatic events (The Adopted Child) is clearly everyone's favorite.  As the main character Lazarus Long is lacking.  I kept drawing parallels between him and another famous fictional character: Lestat de Lioncourt from Rice's Vampire novels.  Both obviously share the immortal parallel but Lestat's personality and flaws made him much more interesting as a character.  Perhaps Long is a characterization of Heinlein himself and as we all know fiction is better then reality.  This book was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula in 1974.  A particularly amazing year with Clark's Rendezvous With Rama and Niven's Protector also in the mix.  Rendezvous is in a whole different playing field then the rest and won both awards hands down and deservedly so.  Bottom Line:  Maybe a must read for Heinlein aficionados and readers of classic sci-fi but this just doesn't work as social sci-fi for me.  Also the book is just too long 
 Quilter's Newsletter has always impressed me with the eye-catching quilts on its covers.  However,the patterns inside are typically the more simplilstic, run-of-the-mill design so I was anxious to have access to construction details for some of the more stunning cover quilts.  The book did not live up to my expectations.  The first 22 pages of the book are devoted to a tedious history of the magazine.  Of the 15 patterns included, only three or four are of the artistry and caliber that I had come expect from a QNM cover and hoped to use as inspiration for my own designs. In addition the instructions and color placements are difficult to follow.  For these reasons I feel the book is an overpriced collection of 15 patterns 
 He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak.  All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful.  The self delusion in the book is amazing 
 You can get all the same advice in this book from women's magazines. No new insights 
 What Prince made so special in the 80ties was his abbillity to create innovative music and at the same time appeal to a big audience. Diamond and Pearls appealed to the crowd, considering the 2 million copies it saled, but there is nothing new or exiting to be found on it. Prince even becomes a trendfollower by introducing rap in his music (Jughead) And offcourse there is "Gett off", a nice funk tune, but like all tracks on this cd, very mainstream. Many of the singles that were pulled from this album became great hits (Diamonds and Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2Night), but they are also amoungst his most uneventfull songs. It shows that being a commercial hit does not equal quality. Only "Willing and Able" and "Strollin'" are showing a tiny glimpse of Prince's true talent and his willingness to experiment with his music. Prince made over 30 albums in his career (I'm proud owner of all of them) and I'm sorry to say this album belongs in the bottomhalf of his catalogue. It was one of his biggest commercial successes and the album sold millions of coppies, but it is also very "middle of the road". It misses spontanity and originality. What is left is a well produced R&B album (perhaps even overproduced), with a handfull of good songs. But non will leave a lasting impression or define Prince's talent. If you seek to be introduced to Prince music get Purple Rain, Sign Of The Times or Lovesexy instead.   
 Than this poorly written, haphazard history.  The photos aren't even coffee book table quality and are often so cropped as to delete important features that the author may have actually described.  This is not for a serious historical reader or for a photo composition review.  It fails on all counts 
 The loneliness, sparkling wit and beautiful simplicity of the original Purple Crayon books (and the quite loyally adapted Gene Deitch animated cartoons - still available from Scholastic) are not to be found here, sacrificed to the treacly situations and inexplicable pastel colors of this confused, frustrating - and to this viewer at least - insulting "interpretation." It's as if Harold were aesthetically reincarnated as one of those hard sugar figurines manufactured for quick decoration of grocery store birthday cakes. I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is "the way things are" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's "Harold." 
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 Nothing much to say about this book, in fact there is very little inside. It is more like an introduction. I never pratice jujistsu but I trained for karate (with some self-defense) for years, and I don't think this book bring me much, except for the ground-fighting chapter (but you will find a lot more ground techniques in "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Practice" by Renzo Gracie, Royler Gracie). I did not like at all the weapon defense part, which shows you how "easy" it is to get rid of someone with a knife or gun ! Please, don't show that in an introduction book, people are gonna get killed trying it  
 I bought this along with the author's first "sneaky" book (I'd give the first one two stars) and now wish I had saved my money.  Cheesy is the best description I can give.  The sneaky uses are completely obvious and, in many cases, too flimsy to survive construction.  The author apparently is fascinated with safety pins, magnets, etc. but who needs a book to explain how to make a wire out of a paperclip?  Also, the art is as amateurish as the ideas.  Not exactly rocket science 
 I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW.  I BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE I PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE.  I LOVE THE HYMS BUT THE MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE QUITE DISTRACTING.  FAIREST LORD JESUS, A BEAUTIFUL HYMN, SOUNDS LIKE A DANCE NUMBER.  PERHAPS I AM JUST GETTING OLD.  I DO HOPE EVERYONE SEES THE MOVIE 
 The book is cute and well written.  The various math possibilities and problems are engagingly presented and are fun.   However, in the midst of an enviornmental speech, the sender of the penquins  says that because penquins are an endangered species, they cannot be exported.  So he "found an expensive but secret way" of getting around the law.   Buried in a delightful story is a disturbing concept: laws apply to others, not oneself, if one dislikes the law.  For this reason, I will not read it to my students, let alone my grandchildren.  
 I must admit that I find Christine Feehan's "Dark" desires deeply disturbing in many ways, and this book, along with _Dark Secret_, is the most disturbing. I was happy when rape stopped being such an essential part of romance novels; I still remember reading Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers' novels when I was young and being freaked out by how often the heroine ended up falling in love with the man who had raped her. But Feehan's books have returned us to those dark days, when sexy heroes force themselves on young and innocent heroines, who then blame themselves for tempting the heroes beyond reason - just as Savannah not only excuses Gregori for raping her, but actually blames herself for wanting some choice and freedom in her life. Frankly, the whole doomed Carpathian species/lifemate thing seems like an excuse to indulge in the misogynist fantasies that say that men can't control their sexuality and that women like to be raped. It is possible to write sexy paranormal romance/erotica that doesn't indulge in the most retrogade gender stereotypes around. Try Emma Holly. 
 I got this for my little girl on her second Christmas. She played with it Christmas day and once in her room. The balls are hard for her to put in the hole at the top. She just started placing them on the slide (not through the top). She never used the panio keys and could not turn the wheel. Not much fun 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame....  
 The book is good, but at times it drags.  There are points where I would have preferred more information and points where you just want here to get on with it.  So far the whole mess with the Eika seems pointless, except to give them someone other than themselves to fight with.  She gives just enought hints and clues to interest most people, but the true fantasy reader will find her frustrating to some degree.  I would recommend the book, but I would be sure to warn people that it isn't the best work I have seen 
 I do not know much about this item as I have yet to receive it. I have been waiting for four months, despite the estimated wait period being 2-3 weeks.  I will update this review upon receiving and reading the book, whenever that may be 
 I must go easier on this film than I would like seeing as it was made in the 50s. Being 19, I'm sure I can't appreciate the calm and painfully cheesy medea of that era. Still, I AM a fan of old movies and enjoy the laid back plots of the older days. O brother. This plot was certainly laid back - in fact, I think it laid all the way back and went to sleep! Three girls fall for three guys. The end! Each girl ended up with the first guy they liked, no surprises or intrigues. There was a gliche to each relationship, but it was ironed out smoothly before you could actually figure out what the big deal was. Two of the men were goony dreamboats, madly in love with their American beauties. The other was a cranky boss who tried terribly hard to be endearing but missed the mark by a mile. Quite predicatable, extremely boring... stick with the good oldies such as Born Yesterday, On The Town, Roman Holiday and the like.  
 I had not read Ted Dekker until I read his collaboration with Frank Peretti with the recent "House".  I really liked that book so I was looking forward to reading more by Dekker.  Unfortunately this was the one I read next and I was very disappointed.  It was hokey.  I'm hoping that some of his others are better 
 The book has a lot of information, but I would prefer to have simpler everyday guidelines, instead of general comments about organization. 
 I read Bonfire, Man In Full, Right Stuff, and Hooking Up, and then tried this one. I could not stand it! Amazing some of these reviews. If you read one of the above and want to try another, stick to that list. Electric Kook-Aide is difficult to read if you like a story that flows and becomes a page turner 
 A great musician but a man desperate for intellectual respect.  The book is virtually 400+ pages of an application for membership into some haughty Paris salon.  Caetano should have stuck to what he knows best-music.  The endless and mind-numbing name-dropping and references to obscure books, artists and philosophers are the written equivalent of a 5 minute arena drum solo.  OK, we know you are smart, that you have ecletic and fine taste, etc. Now tell us about your music. How did you write it, how did you record it?  There is sadly too little information about music and too much dismissal of others for perceived intellectual deficiencies, musical or otherwise.  Speaking of his music, I recently saw Caetano in concert and was shocked by the syrupy shmaltz--he actually performed "Feelings" in English and in total sincerity. He virtually refused to perform anything in Portuguese, perhaps it is not a cerebral enough a language...nothing more than feelings.  UPDATE:  Another reviewer found my review above to be in error, because Caetano is "30 years ahead of his time" in singing one of history's most painfully bad songs, Feelings. The reviewer found the whole thing very funny. I am sure that the reviewer has the famous Teutonic sense of humor to appreciate the joke.  I for one, heard a corny song in accented English.  Forgive me for missing the joke while I tried to cover my ears 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums. It's just a compilation of tracks put on a cd to make money in an easy way 
 "U.S. and Canada only" So no need to market it to me in Europe  
 Unfortunately, Sidney Wolfe and the whole "Worst Pills" business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers, but has failed to live up to it with this guide. In some cases, warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports, but rather, are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased, consumer-oriented source of information. Consider as one example the book's "Do Not Use" warning regarding the prescription drug, Armour Thyroid. Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISN'T any research), the "guide" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association, two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. If this is the sort of "unbiased information" you want about the drugs you take, you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets. If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in "Worst Pills," the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health. I definitely do NOT recommend this book in any way. -- Mary J. Shomon, Thyroid Patient Advocate and Autho 
 I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it.  
 Not much really needs to be said but, I'm sure you are all asking the same question as I am...When is Michael going to die!  I love the original Halloween movies but come on kill him already and end this series before you screw it up anymore.  The same goes for Friday the 13th I mean Jason X with Jason...in space?!  Jason needs to die, Mike Myers needs to die and Freddy Krueger needs to die.  We love the old movies but please stop reviving them somehow just let them die 
 I am going to admit.. I have not read this book. However, during the week, a local radio station here in Cleveland, OH had an interview with one of the authors, Richard Sandomir. First, let me preface this by saying that this radio station's morning show is not a SHock-Jock or "ZOO" format. The radio station is adult oriented, 60's  & 70's music is featured.   The interview began simply enough by trying to explain the concept of Bracketology and the concept of the book. As they are discussing the concept, Mr. Sandomir actually interrupted by saying "Can we get on with the interview?" The interviewers; of which one of them is the sports reporter for all of the radio company's stations as well as a television sports anchor; then proceded to discuss one of the brackets: Best Jock Movies. They revealed that they did not have an actual copy of the book in front of them, so they were asking him how he derived the winners of these brackets. They revealed the winner of that bracket, Raging Bull, and they wanted to discuss one of the matches: Hoop Dreams advancing over Rocky (which seems ludicrous to me). Instead of explaining how this idea came about, what the procedures were, who the experts were, Richard just said " You are just going to have to read the book, the opinions are mine."  As the interviewers were trying to talk to him, and participating in a debate about this, he abruptly said, "This interview is over..." and hung up.   First, this premise is not a new one, I have participated in several of these brackets. Simply put, brackets are based on opinions of others. How pompous it is to even claim it is original! A book like this is very much open to debates and arguements, but these can be very fun. Why was this book even written if the author refuses to discuss them. I see that experts were included, yet he claimed the opinions were his own.  I actually had interest in taking a look at it, but after this man's obnoxious behaviour, I had to review the book based on his behaviour. I am not alone, the guests that followed the interview echoed these sentiments, and the sports anchor will not even use the term brackets now!   To conclude, this is my opinion, and I will be happy to discuss it 
 Under "History of the Jews" there's a photo of a scene from a concentration camp where obviously frightened women and children are holding their hands up in the air while a guard points a machine gun at them. The entry for Joan of Arc comes with an illustration of her being burned to death. The page for the Inquisition has an illustration of a person tied to a wheel over a fire. My 7 year-old son was quite shocked and upset when he found these pictures.  I never would have guessed a children's encyclopedia would expose kids to such graphic subjects 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Usually Carly Phillips books are a quick read for me but I am having a very hard time finishing this book.  I did not find the story interesting enough to want to see what happens next.  I don't know if I will even finish it 
 This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything.  Overall, if you like weird movies like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how "true to life" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one 
 Each chapter says same thing. Never tells you what real issues are all are cloudy an not to the point 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 Maybe I have completely different tastes than the editors of this anthology, or maybe there just wasn't a whole lot of excellent fantasy published in 2003 but I found Year's Best Fantasy 4 to be a hit and miss affair.  Many of the stories are decent but nothing special.  A few are pretty bad.  Even the usually reliable Neil Gaiman has a misfire with the dull "Closing Time."  Kelly Link's "Catskin" is just plain bizarre (but I suspect it's supposed to be).  Among the few excellent stories are the Nebula Award winner "Basement Magic" by Ellen Klages, a clever update on the fairy-godmother story;  One Thing About the Night" by Terry Dowling, a creepy ghost story involving a mirrored room; and "Dragon's Gate" by Pat Murphy, a well-told high-fantasy quest adventure.  There are also some good stories by Lucius Shepard and Terry Bisson.  I should also mention the editor's introductions to the stories often contain plot spoilers so I recommend reading those after reading the story.   
 I thought this book was filled with cliches and did not find it helpful 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I have read a couple other books on general dog training, and this one offered absolutely nothing new above what I had seen before. The case studies presented about dogs  retrained at the author's institute struck me as nothing more than a  blatant advertisement. If you have no experience with dog training  whatsoever, then maybe you will find this book useful. But if you already  have some knowledge of basic training and are looking for some advanced  insight and more effective ways to deal with canine aggression, save your  money. The information here is too superficial 
 This book reminds me of the movie "Pulp Fiction".  Not the writing, the characters, or the complexity of that film, no this book reminds me of what happened the first few years after the film was release.  Every hack director and writer tried to rip off the plot and structure of "Pulp Fiction", and then pretend it was all their own idea.  This same thing happened after "Fight Club" was published, every tired writer who could not come up with an original idea tried to steal the writing structure and style of Chuck Palahniuk.  The problem is, if you are a talented writer you don't need to steal from Chuck Palahniuk, and if you're not a talented writer, you end up with a stink fest like Chemical Pink.   This ugly book is poorly written, with cardboard characters, an uneven and at times non-existent plot, which is then topped off with humiliating sex between two people who hate each other.    The story itself should have been interesting, female body building taken to an extreme.  Women who destroy their femininity, their bodies, and health, in exchange for acceptance into an obscure closed society that values masculine females.  Kudos to Ms. Arnoldi, who managed to make that entire subject no more then a superficial side plot, wedged in between all the silly sex between the main characters.     
 I was expecting a lot more out of this than I got. The entire Northtown side of the cd is lousy, with maybe one or 2 good songs. The Westside tracks arent much better but they do have La Clicka, Redrum Inc., and of course Doomsday. I would say dont buy this unless you collect cd's (like I do), because if you dont you will just end up getting rid of it. Instead of this buy anyone of the Doomsday albums expecially Filthy, it's classick 
 Just like Desperado.  The plot and characters are banal and predictable.  Don't waste your time 
 Hmmmm he goes deep into the history of issues involving the mind, to the point of boredom.  Then he goes deep into what types of physical disorders come from the mind having the issues.  But then nothing.  There is one and a half pages on what you might do in order to assist in resolving these issues.  Come on, if this is truly meant to help people then give them something to work with instead of just recommending psychotherapy.  I agree with the concept that child abuse/neglect can create hell for the rest of that person's life - but give specific ways to help in getting rid of the garbage instead of what was laid out in this book.  He makes way too many references to purchase his other books throughout this book.  Just another book thats "all about the money" and not truly about helping others 
 Anyone that knows anything about Milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs, and contributed much more to society than people like James Stewart, who often act like parasites at the expense of others.  And what about Milken's life after this whole affair? I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation.   Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era.   Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book 
 This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold.  Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in "life lessons" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff.  My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off.  The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film.  
 "With the Dark Magicks that fill these pages" two types of cult could be founded: the cult of Kon-stantinos, or a cult of complete cynicism. As someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs, I do not know which would be worse.   The author's insincerity is self-evident in every concept, and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering...his tone is always "prescient" and always patronizing. The pseudo-goth aspect to Kon's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides, any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting. His obsession with "naughty" alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad.   His spiritual perspective is the same: he plays with a safe "bad boy" boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the "essentially I'm not so bad" image. The impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this.  My one star I rate for "Nocturnicon" comes from the book cover, which is far better than the book deserves, and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer. I have seen much worse get into print, including with his own publishing house, Llewellyn Publications. However if I was a cynic about occult arts, I would use this book to demonstrate why. As a reader I get the feeling that Kon-stantinos feels the same. He's looking to sell a concept, any concept. Here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the Necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus 5.   It seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that "little ****er" (he mentions in the intro) in his head. Either that or his misleading of the (mainly young deluded goth) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity. Which makes him a true Kon-man.                    
 I've spent a year in England and have made >30 visits all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.	  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.   
 A waiste of money - Don't bother 
 The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one! 
 I struggled quite a distance into this book because I love France, but finally I gave up. I found the author to be a poor writer, found her stories to be so farfetched that I decided that she was not being truthful, found her values to be very superficial, found her to be describing things that were not worth reading about--e.g., the car trip to St. Tropez, and her apparent fixation on sex--e.g., her negative descriptions of the way females dress and act in St. Tropez, and her imagings about her husband's indiscretions with the Prince's wife and his dalliance with the girls in the village. Who cares if it happened! Who cares what the author imagines about her husband! You might think her husband would care and the Prince and the Princess would care. I doubt that there even is a Prince and Princess. And if the picture of the author half in a shadows, on the book cover is an example of her professional photographer husband's work, forget it.  With the car trip to St. Tropez, I couldn't take anymore. I took the book back and got a refund 
 I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort. 
 Twice I gave this board game as a gift this holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game, however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly 
 I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group 
 Yes, I know I will get bashed for this rather harsh review but somebody has to get serious.  The title is inaccurate since it did not include "and what the Bible predicts". Although I feel that oil is simply an afterthought of the Tehran regimes and that a nuclear weapon is the real priority, they are all connected.  Throw in radical Islam and you have a potentially heady brew.   But adding Bibical "prophecy" that was not written as prophecy or is taken out of context or is misinterpreted or refers to events back then is opening yourself up to well-deserved criticism. There will always be those who find mysterious messages from the past that just happen to pertain to the present.  Let's get something straight - for prophecy to be valid it MUST pertain to the people for whome it was written, i.e. Israelite tribes. When the Gospel writers have Jesus predicting the destruction of the Temple (written right after its destruction) it was meant to refer to that event - not something 2,000 years in the future.   Think about it - how probable is it that someone living 2,500 years ago predicted the end of the world and second coming of the Messiah when they had not even predicted the first coming??? For sure, the author does not make specific predictions with dates which is a good practice since every end of world date so far has come and gone and we are all still here. He does try a rather fuzzy comparison of names - matching an ancient place with a modern country when the similarity is far-fetched at best.   Lastly, if the author is correct, why do anything? Why not just sit and wait for the final battle, let God intervent then cheer? If this is true prophecy we can't change it and there's the rub - we all know it does not refer to Iran in 2006.  That's why we are working so hard to change events, to alter the course of history -because we DON'T take things like this seriously.  If we did it would be sacriligious to try and work against prophecy wouldn't it? 
   I have used Pasajes: Lengua and Pasajes: Cultura for two years now for Intermediate Spanish and have found it quite difficult to use and to appeal to the interest of the students. Tons of vocabulary words are presented at the beginning of each chapter in Pasajes: Lengua with some weird pictures and no follow-up dialogue to reinforce or recycle the vocabulary. Then quite a few difficult grammatical concepts are presented in each chapter and often mixed together into several confusing exercises which don't allow the student to sort out the usage of one concept before being bombarded with another one. I would use this approach if I purposely wanted to confuse and lose my students. Often the students are at a loss as to how to react to the exercises and instructions. Sometimes out of frustration, I have to simply change the instructions of the exercises or bring in my own exercises to supplement the text. I have noticed a decline in the proficiency of our students after using this text and a definite lack of interest in the material. After over twenty years of teaching, I am no newcomer to teaching languages and only continue to use the text because some faculty who are recent graduates have latched onto it. The bottom line for me is that in order to do a good job using this text, the instructor must basically rewrite the text and bring in a lot of original material to achieve the desired results with students. A class that used to be a lot of fun for me with wonderful interactions with my students, now is often drudgery. 
 I bought this one because I was looking for a very hip Christmas album.  Knowing Peter White, what else is there but hip music.  Wrong.  This wasn't Peter White at all (except for 'Jingle Bells') - or not the Peter White I've become familiar with.  It was just another 'dime-a-dozen' Christmas album... boring.   If you want some smooth jazz hip music.. look elsewhere.  If you want to sleep.. this is the baby for you.  Just try not to snore too loud 
 While several books provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about other cultures, this novel is not one of them.  A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central characters, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make for quite possibly the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible, I would steer clear of this and instead pick up a copy of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinback 
 The book was filled with filler information from about everyone who has ever written about having a the "right" mindset.  But I will give Matt credit though, I might not of liked this book by him, but he does know his stuff on interent marketing 
 From Smother Magazine [[...]]:  The Lashes offer an explanation about why they're not another "the" band: "Hi there, we're a power pop band named The Lashes. Our methods of execution do not need to be questioned. We totally pink swear that we're the real deal and haven't regurgitated the New Wave scenesters at all. And we're like stoked to be playing music again. After our stint in an advertisement for urban clothing, we're glad to be back to rockin' everything that needs to, you know, be rocked. OMG, The Killers totally copped our style, LOL, and like our label picked us up because we were totally original and it has nothing to do with the fact that they're totally trying to exploit this genre for all its worth! ROFL! By the way, do you know how hard it is to comb your hair the opposite direction and keep it there the duration of an entire show!? 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 You would think that the nhl would be able to put out something better than this piece or work.  The "hosts" are corny and their segments are worthless.  The goals themselves are pretty good, but the most recent only go up to about 1995.  So don't expect any of the recent great goals that have been scored in the NHL.  Overall I would only recommend this product to fans who have followed hockey for 15 or 20 years.  
 Nothing but trouble in the long run. Anemometer replaced twice under warranty. Now broken again just as the storms build up. Sending unit no longer sends temp/humidity, even with new batts.  
 Don't waste your time and money on this product.  I have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months, two in the last week.  All of them have had defective switches.  Amazon should not sell this product the quality of the switches is unacceptably poor. 3/13/0 
 Sound wasn't too bad for price. Tinny yes, but cheap. Used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play CDs. And then it wouldn't turn on at all. 
 it's a so-so film with Rourke in the IRA. Some good stuff. Look for Anthony(Stewart Head) as Rupert(note: Anthony Stewart Head portraits another Rupert...Rupert Giles on the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer)so, now you know. but this one is so-so like I sai 
 The rest of the reviewers wrote glowing responses to this book.  From our perspective, it could include more background and easily to understand steps on how to utilize some of the tools, techniques, and methods of compression.    Are there any other books out there for digital compression in more detail that take into consideration the latest technology issues that might have a bearing such as DTV, HDTV, World Wide Uses on legacy systems as well as state of the art systems 
 By now (December 12, 2004) we've learned a few facts about self-promoting blowhard BERNARD KERIK. How marvelous that "The Lost Son" has already been optioned for development as a major motion picture - it has the potential to become the funniest biopic since "Mommie Dearest." I do hope the screenwriter will include a role for JENNIFER LOPEZ as the illegal domestic worker (J-Lo was great in "Maid in Manhattan") and wouldn't MARGARET CHO be wonderful as Bernie's abandoned Korean daughter 
 I was hoping for a synthesis of findings, rather than a rambling, never-ending series of anecdotes.  Further, the latest evidence on criminal profiling is at best mixed - indicating little scientific credibility or practical usefulness 
 When someone indites the 'Theory of Evolution' as a theory not a fact, it makes it sound as if theories and facts are opposite things, as if we are really sure of facts and not so sure of theories. In science theory is a higher level of understanding then facts, because what theories do is explain the facts by uniting them. Theory is a system of explanations that elucidate the observable facts of nature.  This book is a failure of the human desire for scientific understanding: it's been peer reviewed and the response is unanimously negative. Don't waist your time with this waist of paper 
 Open your eyes and read the truth:  http://www.witchvox.com/whs/kerr_pazder1.htm 
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 My Life With the Saints is Fr. Martin's memoir of his relationship with some of his favorite saints. In each chapter he tells about an event in his life and gives a short biography on the saint whom connected with him at the time.   About half of the people mentioned such as Thomas Merton, whom the author seems to most admire, Fr. Arupe, Dorothy Day and Mother Theresa have not been cannonized and except for Mother Theresa it's not likely that they will be.   The book pretty much falls down when the author talks about the cannonized saints. He completely fails to capture St. Therese but does better with the Jesuit saints. The chapters on St. Bernadette and the Ugandan martyrs were very good but two chapters don't justify buying the whole book.  I was actually surprised with how theologically slight this book is. Coming from a Jesuit I was expecting something with more depth and it really feels like it was written for kids or older teens. I was not satisfied at all. 
 I read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing, so it's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing!  I was hopeful the product would work for me.  I've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard, all with the same result:  mounds of dirt leading right up to the Molechaser!  They seem attracted to it, not turned off by it.  I only wish I could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device!  This product has done nothing to discourage moles, voles, etc.  In all three locations, the lawn damage continues.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Look for another solution rather than this product 
 Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book. If you really want to learn about developing content for the Web, buy a good grammar book, a good style book and a good Web design book.  "Developing Online Content" is little more than a rehash of other publications, inflated with meaningless graphics and unnecessary new terms.  The only worthwhile parts of the book are the lists of resources 
 I am dissatisfied with Lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  I encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in Lush's products.  I have yet to see a Lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  There are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently 
 It's hard for me to write a review, because I only read half the book.  It was so poorly written that once I put it down, I never could pick it up again.  If your kids are bad, make them read this book as torture.  It's the only use I could find for the book.  
 Dragonlance is my favorite campaign setting. I have read the Dragonlance Campaign Setting d20 manual, and despite its poor reviews, I thought it was still useful, and was not sadden by the loss of money. This book is completely different.  	The biggest problem with the Age of Mortals, is the constant repetition. The book relates the history of the Dragonlance setting from the end of the Chaos War to the death of Takhisis, and the sacrifice of Paladine. The story itself is rather interesting, but it was already written in the main Dragonlance Campaign Setting book. As if repeating it once was not enough, the authors decided to place the story in several places of the book. The story is written in the introduction. The story is repeated in the beginning of the chapter on religion. The book also has a time table of events, which tells the same tale with the slight difference of separating events by the years on which the event took place. Further, on almost every character profile presented in the book, parts of the story were repeated again.  The art also is in need of repair. It isn't so much that the quality of the drawings is poor, as the quantity is. There are very few pictures compared to that of a typical roleplaying manual. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but there is obvious room for the pictures in the book. There are huge gaps at the end of each chapter, where there is nothing but blank page. This space could have easily been occupied by a picture or two. Had the book cut down on the repetitive story, even more room could have been made for art work. To top the space issues, the problem of the first d20 Dragonlance book was not corrected. This book still has inch thick margins.  The meat of the book lies in the few prestige classes presented. There is also a page of feats, and a couple pages of spells. The balance of the spells and feats is in question, but since I have not yet gotten a chance to use any of them, it would be unfair of me to grade them on their usability. Still even if all the spells and feats were the best feats and prestige classes ever written, this one chapter would not be enough to make up for the poor planning of the rest of the book.  There is a chapter on towns, cities, and strongholds. This is by far the best chapter in the book, but a few of the descriptions of the cities repeat larger parts of the main story. This wouldn't be so much of problem if it weren't for the boredom of having read the story several times already. This chapter had a major flaw. It doesn't have enough maps. Only three cities, or so, actually had a map of the city. Further, this chapter would have been helped greatly had it contained a map of the world, which showed the location of each city in the chapter. The only world map in this book contained directions of seasonal winds, followed by a small description of weather and climate.  There is a chapter of descriptions, which seems to say that the Dragonlance setting has the same main qualities of any other Dungeons and Dragons setting. This Chapter talked about the weather and the people. The only thing new was a small description of a few plants, and their nativity in Dragonlance. It isn't really important to the average gamer, but to someone who likes the poetry of Dragonlance, they might have some uses.  The religion Chapter describes each deity and their new role in the world. The Dragonlance Campaign Setting book already listed the deities. Thus, it was another disappointment that the deities were described again. Luckily a few of the descriptions had insight into what the deities planned for the future, instead of just telling who the deity was.   The structure of the book was also poor. It was rather annoying reading about a race description or a city description and then moving strait into a character profile. Why put Goldmoon's profile in the introduction of the religion Chapter? There really should have been a "Hero" chapter of the book, which contained all the character profiles instead of plugging them into random sections of the book. By eliminating the unused space, and the repetition of this book, the publishers could have made a decent soft cover book, and lowered the price by a good 10 to 15 dollars. Even with Amazons low prices, this book isn't worth the money.  
 The movie "Extreme Ops" which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it. It is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment.  Let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips. This movie has no plot and no characterization. The point appears to be to display some "amazing" stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station.  The plot, and I use the term loosely, concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film. They have been hired by a Japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche (the reason why is never really given) so this ragtag group heads for Austria. Why they made the decision to film the shot in the Alps instead of the perfectly good Rocky Mountains is similarly never explained, except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering Serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death.  Understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers. He, like the theater audience, seems to find them just as annoying as we do, but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or, even more sensibly, walking out in the middle of the movie, he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them.  I usually try to find some good points in a movie I review so it is somewhat balanced, however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say, I guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count?  Do yourself a favor and give this a miss. I would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on DVD shelves. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull, dumb movie 
 There is no doubt that Mercator was a great geographer. Among his achievements were: the projection bearing his name, the first modern Atlas, and even the naming of North America. He played an important role in the amazing successes and adventures of the Age of Discovery. He truly was an amazing man.  Having said this, I found Crane's book to be lacking. I thought that the book was well researched and well grounded, but the delivery was poor. When buying a popular history book, in addition to the facts I expect a gripping story, masterfully told. However, Crane's writing style is dry and while the book is filled with names, dates, facts and figures the story telling is simply not there. Crane often gets bogged down in minute details that are distracting, dry and are simply not important to the story he is trying to tell.  In short, this may be a good history book, but it is not a book that I would recommend for the typical reader of POPULAR history 
 i think the newer version "the love affair" with Warren Beatty/Annette Benning better. 
 If you are expecting to learn anything new about German secret weapons then forget this book. Everything in it has been covered before countless times in other books dating back 40 years. Anyone with a moderate knowledge of the subject could have written this over a slow afternoon. Save your money and put it towards any of the other similar boos available at Amazon.com 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 Jim Coan was my Marine tank platoon leader during part of my 12 month & 29 day tour in Vietnam.  I have read countless historical volumes about the War in Vietnam.  Jim tells one of the most comprehensive and detailed histories of this God-forsaken piece of real estate that I have ever read.  "Con Thien - The Hill of Angels" should be required reading on the Commandant of the Marine Corps Career Enhancement Reading Program.  Five Stars and two thumbs up for his wonderful book.  John Wear Alfa Co, 3rd Tank Bn Former Sgt of Marine 
 The very first chapter talks about folks starting to invest in real estate.  Of course they bought all their investment properties  using other peoples money (mortgages), which is fine. The only question for Mr. Kiyosaki: Which bank is giving a conventional mortgage for the investment property at 95 % LTV, meaning putting only 5% down? As far as I know 5% downpayment  or less is available for PRIMARY residence ONLY. You can not have 2 primary residencies. The Bank can see in your credit report how many mortgages you have. When applying for the new mortgage bank requires to explain all other mortgages in the credit report. You definetely can not buy all 5 properties -  with 5 % down. It is very inaccurate and misleading. Minimum downpayment for the investment property is 20%, not every bank will do it, a lot of them will ask for 25-30% downpayment for investment properties. Go to your local bank and check it out. So Mr. Kiyosaki is not telling the truth? Are those stories REAL? Seems like he is getting rich on writing very controversial books using the success of the first couple of them but not really investing in real estate. 
 Just a warning that no nutritional breakdown of the recipes (e.g. calories, fat, fiber, carbohydrates) is provided.  This is a big miss considering the number of people that use this information to calculate Weight Watcher points or determine insulin units needed.    The selection of recipes is good and geared to a more simple and speedy preparation.  So not a complete waste - just more effort if you need the nutritional guide 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 The best way to destroy sales is for the "author" to blast portions of the book.  In the follow-up to the commercially successful Catch This!, Terrell Owens has said there are erroneous passages in T.O. Because of that comment, it brings into question the validity of the entire book.  Love him or hate him, Owens is a pop culture phenomenon and that may be why Simon & Schuster rushed to print a second autobiography. I can only guess that Owens was not happy with the project and decided to tank sales by ripping the finished product.  Within the proper context I am sure Owens has a ton of interesting things to say. The line of children's books slated for release may be the venue for Owens to make a positive and lasting impression with fans.  
 Don't waste your money on this book unless you already have, and want to use, FrontPage Express - a program that I could not find anywhere to download. Note that the date the book was published is 1999, which makes it 6 or 7 years old - exceedingly old in cyber terms!  I don't know why they are ordering more to sell.  No one appears to have anything to say about the book since 2000.  Get something newer 
 Maybe this book picks up later but I'll never know. God what a disappointment, this book is nothing but procedures. "I went to this office for this..", "I had to fill out the correct CIA form for that..", "I had a meeting with so & so...", geez. what a snooze-fest, I put it down under 50 pages, I can't take it, unless I need something to put me to sleep. I guess if your career is management, you'll find all this terribly exciting, for the rest of us, there's nothing here but bureaucracy & utter disappointment 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 With Shriek Show, connoisoeurs of eurotrash know its best to wait, because quite frankly, few of the titles in their catalogue are worth the single-disc asking price! BUT, as with their Post Apocalyptic Action Triple Feature Pack, their Psycho Killers Triple Feature Pack, their Jungle Horror Triple Feature Pack, their Martial Arts Triple Feature Pack and their Evil Animals Triple Feature Pack, their Zombie Triple Feature Pack, their Wicked Women Triple Feature Pack, and their Demons Triple Feature Pack, this newest edition, the JUNGLE GIRLS TRIPLE FEATURE PACK provides a cheap fix for those who absolutely must see some of the worst euro-junk from the 80's. And at about $6 a disc, these pieces of crap are finally WORTH the money, though you'll pay far less in certain retail chain stores. I found it for $12.99, which further justified a peek.  Up first is GOLDEN TEMPLE AMAZONS, a deathly dull Jess Franco piece filled to the brim with topless women who remain topless throughout to distract you from the utter bankruptcy of ingenuity and awfulness of the story, about a young topless jungle girl, raised by a black tribe, who grows up to take revenge on the nearby tribe of topless evil amazons who killed her parents when she was young. Coming as is did at a time when Franco movies had long since stopped being even remotely interesting (and trust me, most of this man's work isn't even remotely interesting, save for perhaps WANDA THE WICKED WARDEN), the whole thing feels like one lazy grab for what few dollars remained in the exploitation market at the time before being dumped internationally on video under any number of the usual retitlings. In fact, much of the film was directed by a Eurocine journeyman and it was largely edited by company men as well. Eva Leon proves she's still got it, at least from the neck down, as the leader of the Golden Temple Amazons, her wardobe consisting of an eyepatch, a vest and a teensy tiny g-string as she whips her minions and our heroine with gusto. The golden temple "set," such as it is (and probably the centrepiece of most of the scenes actually shot by Franco), is really just a cave with foreground miniatures of "golden" pillars and friggin' BIRDCAGE bars feebly tyring to telegraph some kind of scale. Oh, screw it, let's move on to...  AMAZONIA: THE CATHERINE MILLS STORY (aka Schiave Bianche: Violenza in Amazzonia). Probably the best of the bad bunch in this set, if only for the participation of famed mondo pioneer Franco Prosperi (Mondo Cane, Uncle Tom's Cabin, Africa Addios) who seems to have had an influence on director Mario Garrizzo, who directs this largely in the pseudo-documentary style of Prosperi and Jacopetti's earlier works. Hell, most of the cutaways in this (the shots of beautiful scenery and animals killing each other) look suspiciously like they were shot by the Mondo giants, for they frequently don't match the footage of the main story, . The rather haunting score feels familiar, too. That story, such as it is, is told in flashback by virginal schoolgirl Catherine Miles (Elvire Audray), on trial for the murder of two people. Turns out her parents were killed by a ruthless tribe (she says) during a picnic boat trip down the Amazon. Rescued by the benevolent lead hunter of the tribe, which is the typically nonsensical mix of Spaniards and Asians that seems to crop up in all of these damned things, she gradually learns their ways, and watches their graphic rituals, and spends virtually the entire film topless, and falls in love with her new guardian, all the while nurturing her plan for revenge against him and his people. The revelation of the killers' identities would have been a surprise had they not diappeared from the narrative DURING the crucial murder sequence because the filmmakers couldn't figure out a smart way to temporarily divert the audience's attention away from them, so they just vanish until the end of the film. Dialogue in this is minimal, and comes largely from the courtroom framing sequence, while the presence of a Mondo-style narrator at the beginning and end of the film (where we're supposedly shown footage of the "actual" Catherine Miles in jail, is another nod to Prosperi's roots.  Finally, we have DIAMONDS OF KILIMANDJARO, another slog through the jungle from Jess Franco starring Katia Bienert (EUGENIE) as the white jungle goddess sought out by a crew of hunters and relatives working for her mother, Franco regular Lina Romay, who doesn't just PLAY a bloated bedridden mess in this, but was actually starting to LOOK like one in real life, and she was only 29! But even in her brief scenes, she fares better than Bienert, who looks positively STONED--or stupid--throughout, swinging topless from vines she barely has the strength to hold on to. One would never believe that this stick of wood had been "acting" for three or four years by the time this came out! Her enemy in this is topless Black Jungle Goddess Aline Mess, a feral stunner who has planted Katia's WHITE, SCOTTISH uncle (complete with tam o'shanter hat and bagpipe theme music) on the tribal throne as part of her cunning plan to take revenge on the evil white men who have threatened her people. Relatively bloodless, but generous in the boobies department, but since it's a mid-80's Franco, everything is shot so matter-of-factly, and without one hint of sensuality, that you just stop carring after the second pair are paraded across the screen.  Extras on these discs are the photo galleries (on all three discs), original trailers for each film, plus several others (again, all three discs) and interviews with Eurocine honcho Daniel Lasouer (on GOLDEN TEMPLE and DIAMONDS, each about 12 minutes), both of which prove to be more enlightening--and more interesting--than either of the films they accompany. 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 I am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications.  I found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point.  The author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue, which I find a bit tiresome.  The text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff.  Definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text.  I suspect I am the wrong target audience 
 Nothing in this book would be inappropriate for a 6-year-old to see. All the pictures were in black and white and NONE of them were gory. This book is just recycled stories we've all heard about dead celebs with a portrait of them included. It should be called "My First Mystery Book". Very disappointing 
 This was not what I expected, I love "food" movies like "Eat drink man woman", "Tortilla Soup", "Like Water for Chocolate",This movie was just a long boring trek through bad accents and poorly lit italian food, I realize that the food was supposed to be showcased here, but it didnt wet my appetite a bit, a can of chef boyardee looks more appetizing. I was glad the restaurant tanked, that louis prima didnt show up. The "big night" turned out to be a tiny blip of a movie 
 Overall, I would say this book was pretty boring.  I like books that have more dialogue and action than description and details.  The one thing this book had plenty of was description and details.  It seemed like Lahiri gave way too much background information and didn't tell enough about the actual story as it pertained to Gogol.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie preview made the movie seem pretty good.  I have a feeling this would still be a good movie, but just not a very good book.  If you don't want to be very entertained and enthused, then read this book.  Otherwise, I would choose something with more action and entertainment 
 I order a book (interplay)from this person about 5 months ago, and I still do not have my book. This person still not even giving me back my money !!!!!!!! 
 If you don't know anything about EMT work, this book may be helpful to you. I am taking classes as an EMT and it didn't help me at all. In most chapters you can practically substitute any career for the word EMT and the  book would still make sense(excluding the chapters "Why become an  EMT" and "All About EMT's"). If you're not familair with EMT  work and have no idea how to get into the field, this book may be a good  choice. For the most part the information in this book is too general for  someone who's already on the path to becoming an EMT 
 I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.  My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.  On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.  Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie 
 "Looking Backward" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth.  But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received.  Bellamy was 31 when this book was published.  As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep.  But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system.  Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates.  His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order.  These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words.  I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues.  And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston.  But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting?  We never find out, because he doesn't tell us.  In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires.  Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale.  He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings.  And there is a glaring error in his utopian world:  He does not take into account human nature.  He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more.  As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating.  Paraphrasing here:  Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.  With that, I agree.   
 This is an interesting, knowledgeable, but very short and skimpy, paperback book by a professor of neurobiology whose perspective is that of a primatology/evolutionary psychologist. The book contains some tiny photographs of the primates in question. It is a decent addition to the collection of anybody who is obsessed with learning every last thing about our various ape relatives.   My complaint/concern is that the author's description of the book, and the example photos shown on Amazon, might lead one to expect it to contain high quality photographs. Instead, what you get is a tiny paperback of miniscule, grainy, terribly reproduced amateur black-and-white photographs by the professor, many of them shot at the zoo.   Do NOT be deceived by the lovely color photographs in the publicity. There are no color photographs, or well-reproduced photographs, except on the front and back covers. Really, this has the feel of a home-made vanity press kind of book.   For a more thorough treatment of the topic of human/ape nature, consider reading Frans De Waal's "Our Inner Ape". De Waal also published a book of gorgeous photographs of primates. For a more thorough exploration of evolutionary psychology, see Pinker's How The Mind Works.  
 What can you say about Buffy The Vampire Slayer that hasn't already been said? IMMORTAL is a typical Buffy story, with the typical cast of characters and the typical formula plot. Fun, but Shakespere is in no danger of being replaced. The biggest letdown of the audio version was, sadly, Charisma Carpenter, or Cordelia to her fans. The lady is an adequate actor, but her reading skills need a LOT of work! This could have been a more enjoyable program with a better narrator. Sorry, Cordy 
 I love the novels of George Eliot and am fascinated by her life, but was appalled to have to struggle to read this biography, which was dry and boring. I tried three times and still only got halfway through it. Now I'm off to find another biography of George Eliot that captures the essence of Eliot in tone and style as well as fact. Such a highly talented and insightful author who lived so daringly and unconventionally in Victorian times certainly deserves a biographer capable of making such an engaging life engaging to read. This one does not 
 I hated this book alot. Miriam made the Indians seem disgusting and barbaric. She kept talking about how bad the Indians were and blaming her family for being captured, I really thought it was dull 
 missing pages, older version is okay, this new one the 1999 one has the missing page 
 I chose this book because "Awareness" is in the title.  Although I wasn't expecting a lot of nuggets, I did expect some.  Unfortunately, none were to be found.  Instead, this book reads like a session with a psychologist - and not a very good one at that.  The author begins by writing, "If you have picked up this book, then odds are that in someway you feel dissatisfied with your life."  Again, that is not why I chose this book.  Warning - this is the theme of the book.  The author's own words sometimes weigh down the pages with emotional dissatisfaction.    Much of the advice is written in generalities.  Often times, emotional issues were lumped together as if a one-off, cure-all by being "aware" will resolve any and all emotional problem.  Sure, awareness is the first step and yes, gaining control of your emotions is important.  However, if you are looking for sound emotional advice, you should see a licensed professional. 
 I really wanted to love this camera. The camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans!   I did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so I expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. The 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! Another huge plus is that each "shot" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a PC using a USB cable. No further processing - the file just copies and plays in Quicktime, etc. Another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.  Now the sad part; Amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the LCD and CCD. The bad pixels on the LCD, according to the manual, are expected and "Not a malfunction"; I disagree with that. For the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the LCD monitor. The HUGE problem is the bad pixels on the CCD! This results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the "image stabilization". The image stabilization shifts the image the CCD receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! However, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. It's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.  The bad CCD is the reason why I can't love the C6... I gave up hope and sent both back to Amazon. I'm not sure what I will buy now. 
 If you want a Jan Karon Book with adultery, gays, and  anti Christian values,  read this series! Jan Medlicott has "modernized" the Mitford series-but included "familiar things" such as a sweet red haired boy character and drawn sketches of the town of Covington for examples-right out of Mitford-- there are so many similarities that I wonder how she "got away with it"!  Come back Jan Karon 
 The magazine is great!  The problem is, I am not receiving them. I ordered a subscription in January and have received 3 issues only!!!  All my other orders with amazon have been received, I have no idea what is happening with my magazine subscription. I wrote to amazon to ask if there was a way of tracking my order but haven't gotten a response 
 Amy and Leon do quite a job with traditional texts. It is not an accident that the only evidence for such absurd moral values is found in ancient texts. Ancient texts provide excellent material for modern sociological studies. Fantastic, really. If you take your bearings from the Kasses' book, I would suggest to you that you check out First Things "the Journal of Religion and Public Life" and read about the many reasons women should remain demure, submissive and concern themselves above all with finding and keeping an attractive husband. Mmmmmm. God, like Homer works in mysterious ways 
 I was disappointed in this book for several reasons.  First, it was classified as "science" when in fact it is a first person narrative of how the author investigated various avenues of mythology, history, biology, and other subjects. A typical chapter describes how, stunned and shaken by the train of thought he has been following, the author intrepidly soldiers on, diving into books and articles and perhaps making a phone call to a writer or scientist friend (many of whom are not mentioned by name).  Second, the author includes a few token quotations from the shamans he holds in such high esteem and claims can communicate directly through DNA - but doesn't take the opportunity to travel to meet them or interview them. That would have been a much more interesting read, from a travel and cultural perspective.  As for his dismissal of modern science and scientists for their narrow-mindedness and materialism, I find it highly suspect that he is perfectly willing to quote scientific studies and principles to justify his points (such as when he describes how DNA replicates or when discussing the molecular structure of various hallucinogens) but shrugs his shoulders at major bodies of scientific thought (mainly evolution) as though those scientists can't possibly know what they're talking about. He reminds me of intelligent design theorists who love to talk about gaps in the fossil record, without a hint of irony that they are dependent on the scientists doing the research for evidence of a fossil record, or gaps in it, to begin with.  Basically, this is a New Agey view of intelligent design. The author can sound like a scientist on occasion, but clearly isn't one. He doesn't seem to know anything about RNA (he calls it "messenger DNA") or plasmids. His theory that all DNA molecules are part of a global web that communicates with and designs itself doesn't make sense when you think about auto-immune disorders, cancers, or even allergies. And he needs to update his textbook about evolution, too, since he puts great stock in objections that have been long since answered.  It's a shame - this could have been a really interesting book, but the writing is too self-absorbed, and the "science" is inaccurate at best and plain wrong at worst 
 I never received this product!!! I returned the black cloth bag I received instead of the glasses and I received an e-mail confirmation of my return of what I had received.  I have never received a refund!! 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 Michael Lesy has been fascinated by archives for a long time. His Ph D dissertation led him to "Wisconsin Death Trip," a remarkable testimony.  "Angel's World" is in fact the first chapter of a book formerly released by the same author (in 1985) under the title "Visible Light". In other words, compared to the original version, 3 chapters are now missing. Moreover there is no new light added to the chapter extracted from "Visible Light." The text in "Angel's World" is exactly the same, 26 years later, the images too. The latter were formerly displayed in the form of pseudo-contact sheets; in the new publication each occupies a whole page without any rmarkable improvement in the printing, whic for a photobook, sounds like a disregard of the photographer and the audience.I f you can look for "Visible Light" in your local independent used-book store, or search for it on Amazon 
 This book is a collection of reviews from the New York Times, containing many different writers. The book has a wide range of reviews, which is good, but you can find a good list of great movies in other, better books (and on the web too).   The big problem I have with the book is with the critics. They're the most pretentious people I have ever read. They seem incredibly detached from all the movies they write about. They seem held back, as if they're almost afraid of liking the movie too much. I wonder if they would give their favorite movie of all time anything above a three out of ten.   One of the reasons Roger Ebert is the best critic today is because, when he really loves a movie, you can tell, not by his star rating, but by how he works so hard to convey his admiration for it (or his disgust, in the case of a bad movie.) I don't quite see how the pressure of deadlines could force these writers to distance themselves from these films, but it would've been nice if they injected a little humanity into their reviews. Definitely not recommended. 
  This was not a great book,  This reader envies and admires the author being able to return to Columbia College and partake in the "Great Books Program".  The author could not maintain this reader's attention.  Many passages from the classics seemed to drone on, peppered with some side-light descriptions of the author's  younger "college aged" classmates.  I can see by the number of five star reviews that this book was a hit with many readers.  I thought it provided a narrow scope on classic literature.  The book I read previous to this book was Harold Bloom's "The Western Cannon".  Harold Bloom gives concrete examples and rules why a book should be considered a classic in Western Literature.  This book by David Denby offers a more intuitive approach.  I recommend Harold Bloom's book instead.  
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 I have taken an introductory course in quantum and am now studying intermediate quantum.  This book has been of no help.  This book is way too advanced and should be entitled, "Schaum's Outline of Quantum Mechanics for Post-Doctorates of Physics.&quot 
 Here are some interesting facts relating to "Heat" and myself:  LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231 NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0 NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0 NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6   Truth be told, I've never actually watched "Heat" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really "Heat"s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)  And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film "Adaptation", and though it didn't specifically refer to "Heat" it totally applies.  On a related note, "The 3" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than "Heat", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out "Adaptation".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)     Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think "Heat" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years "Heat" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.  But til then, the hell with "Heat".  I'll just watch "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "The Departed" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than "Heat".    
 I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!  Nor 
 I hate to be negative when it comes to Christian fiction.  This is the second book in the genre I've read and this one isn't much better than the first one I read, although this book seems to appear to want to be affiliated with the "chick lit" genre, by the look of the cover and the title.  I didn't feel a real connection between the two 'friends.'  They could have been put together by a travel agency for all the warmth that I felt between the pages.  Like another reviewer here, what I did like were the historical Hawaiian tidbits.  There were also frequent reminders to appreciate God's creation, and it certainly doesn't hurt to be reminded of that.  The secondary characters were about as human as a sack of potatoes.  Midway through the book, I was anxious for it to be over as I didn't feel I was going to like it any better beyond that point.  Again, as another reviewer here mentioned, their little vacation was just too perfect.  I wasn't really transported to another place as the author seems to think she's doing by going into detailed description of the islands, the food and the ambiance.  Reading about two women having fun on a vacation just didn't do it for me.  The little snafus (if you could even call them snafus) barely made a blip on the screen of the plot.  And having pregnant Hope drive like Speed Racer with a truck full of surfers on the Hawaiian highway was innapropriate and irresponsible.  It seemed that the author was trying to show the reader that Hope had a little bit of a "free spirit" within her but it didn't really come off that way.  Just seemed like stupid behavior to me.  Finally, the word "sisterchick" comes off as cornball.  I can't imagine who would actually use that word to describe themselves and their friends in real life 
 You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan.   The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the  album a light, airy feeling.  Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment.   You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music.  I would  call this a "pleasant" album, which in my jazz-world is not a  happy thing 
 This book is [inexpensive] and cheesy, and offers little of use.  In addition, the information provided is often dead wrong 
 The author spoke only from her point of view, which was Midwestern and Christian.  She devoted a huge section to church weddings, and a tiny section for any other kind, which did not help me at all.  Also, she kept talking about NOT having a wedding outdoors, which doesn't make any nature-loving bride happy, nor does it give a California bride tips on planning her outdoor wedding.  Thirdly, this book doesn't include many ethnic or cultural tips and traditions (except for the tiny part on the Jewish wedding).  Try the Unoffical Guide to planning your Wedding or the Dummies book instead 
 James J. Cramer is responsible for much of what occurred during the tech bubble.  He was a cheerleader for the tech boom and now says that others got screwed?  HE WAS DOING THE SCREWING!  This is hypocrisy at its best.    From his near firing at Goldman to the collapse of his own company (TheStreet.com is down 90% plus from its IPO price) Cramer is a genius - at cashing in on his own failures.    Do not touch this book with a 50 foot pole. 
 This book is silly, silly.  It has an obvious agenda, one that overtly perpetuates "la leyenda negra" (the black legend).  Also, if so many Latin Americans are going to express such anti-European (Spain) sentiments, then why do they call themselves "Latino?"  The Latins (Latinos) are those from Latin Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Southern France) - if so many Latin Americans feel so "anti-European" then why not come up with another name for themselves?  For an "actual," "balanced" history of Latin America, read Donghi's book... "A Contemporary History of Latin America."   
 Well, not much else to say really... this pretty much sucks. Don't get me wrong, they are easily one of the best alternative bands EVER (along with Drive like Jehu, Fugazi and Sonic Youth). Their best albums are, in no particular order, HEAD/PURE, DOWN, LIAR and GOAT, with SHOT still being good but with a cleaner sound that sadly reminds that it wasn't produced by Steve "abrasive" Albini. This pretty much means that except for Blue, I'd recommend you buy anything else they recorded 
 But had one of the  worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts?  For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!  Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers 
 I have a B.S. in marine science, and I decided I wanted to bring my work home with me. Someone bought me this book and I read through most of the sections.  I was very disappointed.  The author doesn't discuss cleaning of the tank in any detail, such as how often you need to clean the gravel, plants and other decorations; they also missed out on describing common problems such as bacterial or algal blooms and what to do.  I found some of the information very helpful, but overall, this is far from a complete reference book for the beginner aquarist.  
 There is a good reason why this book is going used for 93 cents. Don't waste even that. I can't believe I bought this book. 
 I was disappointed in this book/tape.  I thought it would give me some real insights into life and spirituality, as alot of good books have.  But this was just nausiatingly gay, hopelessly drippy, and not insightful at all.  I didn't want anyone to read poetry to me or ask me to notice what a peach looks like.  I wanted something different.  I give it two stars because I know other people liked it, and others may find it nice to read/listen to 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 This book is incredibly boring and tedious to read.  It has no plot; I fell asleep every time I tried to read it.  It isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the Indians have the ability to talk to animals.  Remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; James Welch takes foreshadowing a little too far.  A final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest 
 This book is like reading a trashy tabloid - lots of flashy big colour photos, low on substance. Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.  The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.   Very disappointing. I suspect this book is intended for age group around 8-15 although it never says this anywhere 
 Is this book a hoax, written to show how little the public will demand in an action / thriller?  I thought Chris Ryan's "Greed" did that, but even his book had a few moments of competence.  Johansen's work is so juvenile, fake, derivative, silly, and just insultingly bad that it sets a new low in my memory.  It would be devastating criticism of a published author to say that I could write as well.  But I would burn the manuscript before confessing to this turkey, which could be the screenplay for the worst B-movie you ever saw.  The "plot" is a brain-dead fabrication from current events; there is no technical knowledge or experience whatever; the characters are ludicrous stereotypes from a zillion trash bodice-rippers and Harlequin romances; their interaction is laughably imagined; the heroine is insanely irritating - but attracted to her ultra-macho abductor, who typically kills with one blow... oh come on!  It's so awful!  Sadly, producing such drivel can earn someone a place on the book racks and book lists.  And Johansen has many books in print!  Bantam should be ashamed for publishing tripe like this.  We should be ashamed for buying it 
 That the stupifyingly sophmoric songwriting of Buffalo Tom's Bill whatshisname still finds an outlet onto an unsuspecting music buying public is beyond this humble listener's understanding. That said, this is an incredibly bad record 
 The book is good in terms of analyzing a parrot's behavior. Good effort was made to produce it. But, are the solutions given in the book really work? Keeping in mind that many parrot owners will not go into group therapy for example for their pet 
 My 2 1/2 yr old grandson is a HUGE monster truck fan. He really only knows the Monter Jam circuit so I thought I'd get this to show him bigfoot. Well, what a flop. He watched it once, about half way through and does not ever want to watch it again.. : 
  Pilzer's general proposition is that the market place will take care of the health insurance issues in this country if we just let the free market operate.  He maintains that individual health insurance is widely available at reasonable cost and people, including employers and employees,  should take advantage of the individual market for health insurance.  I believe he tends to force the facts to fit this basic proposition.   He is easy to read with a breezy style.  The book has pretty good explanations of HIPAA and COBRA and a number of good tips.  However, health insurance in the United States is complicated.  The price he pays for simplicity is accuracy and thoroughness.  It is a pretty good book if you are 35, perfectly healthy, and thinking about buying insurance. But what is good for when you are 35 is not necessarily good 5, 10 or 20 years later. (Should I pay for drug coverage?. . . pregnancy coverage?)  I would never rely on this book for making policy decisions or for forming opinions on healthcare in the United States.  I strongly disagree with many of his policy recommendations.  Some problematic propositions from the book:  1.  Several places in the book he claims that insurance companies in the individual market only turn down or place exclusions on 20% of applicants and 80% are accepted as healthy.  He uses this statistic to support his idea that most people can get coverage in the individual market. I don't know about the accuracy of this statistic, but one problem is that people who are uninsurable often do not apply for insurance on the open market.  They stay on their employer plan.  They go into a risk pool. They buy a conversion plan.  Etc.   Even Pilzer advises against applying for insurance if you think you might get turned down. So the healthy gravitate to these plans and the unhealthy do not.   Pilzer doesn't discuss what "healthy" might mean and his discussion of the underwriting process doesn't describe what are the typical issues that exclude people from coverage. He does not address the possibly of  the healthy fleeing to cheap plans while the unhealthy are trapped in what they already have, causing greater  cost disparity.  2.  For those who say they can't afford health insurance Pilzer claims that "If  your annual income is below the federal poverty line, about $20,000 for a family and $10,000 for a single individual-you probably qualify for Medicaid."  This simply is not true, unless you have children at home, are disabled, or meet some other special category.  Low income alone does not qualify a person for Medicaid.  In this same vein, he claims that of the 45 million uninsured, 16 million earn more than $40,000 for a family of four  ($20,000 for a single)  and 29 million earn less.  He assumes that the 29 million earn at least $20,000 if a family and $10,000 if single.  Otherwise he claims they would be on Medicaid.   He maintains that these low income families could easily buy a low cost HSA plan.  But how are they going to pay those big deductibles?   Also, his cost data is for people age 35 and their families.  In most states, the older you are the more expensive insurance gets.   In this discussion, he ignores the issue of underwriting and possible exclusions for preexisting conditions and ignores the fact that in most states, this population could not afford the risk pool which runs on the average, 200% the cost of the same plan for a healthy individual.   3. "Despite what you read in the newspapers, there are health insurance optionsavailable for every American, although it may take you some time, effort and expense to get them." This is one of his soundbite quotes he uses in advertising materials for his book.  This is misleading.  Insurance on the individual market is not available for many people.  The risk market policy will have preexisting condition exclusions and may have coverage riders unless you are coming off of a group plan and have HIPAA rights.  The risk market may be unaffordable.  If you don't have HIPAA rights, there may be no option for you at all in some states.  4.   He states that "the premium you pay for an individual or family policy cannot be raised each year, nor can the policy be canceled based on your health or your prior year healthcare costs."  He mentions this several times in the book.   At best this is a case of overgeneralization, at worst it is a misleading statement to support his thesis that individual health insurance is the solution to our insurance woes.   I have read a lot about health insurance.  Federal law requires guaranteed renewal of individual health insurance plans.  Does this mean that rates cannot change based on your health status?  Many state's insurance regulators think so. But that does not make it law.   Most states allow rates to increase based on age. Some states' laws do provide that your rates can't go up based on your personal health situation. But other states have no laws that apply and in general, the individual market is not highly regulated.  From what I have read, experts are not in agreement as to the extent re-underwriting occurs on renewal and insurance companies are not very forthcoming with information about why a particular person's rate increases.  Some experts believe that re-underwriting is occurring more and more by a number of insurance companies.  Also, some insurers have durational rate settings.  This means that your insurance costs can go up considerably after a few years.  At that time, you can reapply for a lower cost policy, but can be denied if you are not in good health.   4.   Pilzer repeatedly claims that individual health insurance is cheaper than employer provided insurance.  It probably is cheaper if you are 35 and healthy.  Probably not if you are 60.  This is because employers charge the same rate to everyone, whether you are 20 or 60. Also, only 4% of people in the US have insurance on the individual market.  So it is a small part of the overall market. Pilzer doesn't break down what that market looks like as to age and health of its participants.    5.   Pilzer's discussion of the uninsurable and state subsidized programs like riskpools leaves much to be desired.  Mostly because there is so much state variability.  This is another circumstance where I really disliked that he used figures applicable to a 35 year old male.  The costs are considerably higher for those 50 and over.   He fails to mention that some risk pools have low lifetime limits and other restrictions.  6.   Pilzer pushes the idea that small employers should go to a reimbursement model, leaving their employees to buy health insurance on the individual market. Employers with older/sicker employees are in fact facing higher costs.  However, their employees are going to have problems getting insurance on the open market and may end up with only very high cost options.  The employer that has a young and healthy workforce already has lower costs 
 I tried this book based off of several of the positive reviews and was disappointed.  The "cute" stories and rock and roll music references was not enough to keep it interesting.  Sure risk is a difficult subject but this book did not come up with anything new or innovative on the subject.  Likewise, the basic premise the author uses of levering and delevering your portfolio based on p/l or perceived opportunities may work fine if the markets are highly liquid and transactions costs are minimal such as in large cap stocks but it is much more complicated for other stratgies and markets.  How does the book address converts, mortgages, options, distressed debt, etc?  I will save you the money and tell you- it doesn't.  Now this may not be an issue if you are a short term oriented active trader of stocks ala SAC or scalping e-minis but for the rest of us that are involved in other strategies it is of zero value.  
 I have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the Bible is the only book one has to read, and that great literature consists entirely of the Left Behind series.  I bought this movie to get a sense of this group.  Banal is the kindest word I can find for this tripe.  Third rate actors, low-rent science fiction backdrops, and completely out of touch with reality.  The movie opens with the Israeli agricultural "miracle."  What it does not tell the audience is that Israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20% of the Israeli government's budget funded by US taxpayers through the US Government's very unwise investment in this apartheid regime (see Jimmy Carter's new book) and if it were not for the blatant Israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the Arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth.  Israeli agriculture is not a miracle, it is a travesty--it consumes 50% of all the water used in Israel, and produces less than 5% of the Gross Domestic Product.  The movie goes downhill from there.  Just to place it in a proper religous movie context, if the "Ten Commandments" was a perfect 10, this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2 
 I ordered the Igloo quick and cool 150 from Target. I had it 2 days after ordering. It was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used. Back it went. Be careful ordering from Target in January. They have to do something with those Christmas returns. Check out the product carefully. 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
 I really wanted to love this book. It came strongly recommended by a good friend who is very interested in development work.  Whenever I read a review I always try and figure out what angle the reviewer is coming from, so for the record I'm deeply interested in development work and I have a background in economics and environmental science, but mostly I'm just really well read.  The book immediately starts off on the wrong foot when Sachs, for some reason, decides to set 1820 as the base year for determining world poverty and decides that in 1820 the world is universally poor and on an even playing field. In doing so, he ignores European colonization of virtually all of South America, All of North America, and most of Africa and the resulting poverty that occurred among the indigenous populations as they were thrown off the best plots of land. He brushes aside the argument that colonization had a great deal to do with the rapid development of the west by pointing out that the colonies economies grew even during colonization. This is true, however, there's a reason for that: the colonizers had installed local populations. Some of the money was staying put, the vast majority was going to the "mother country." He also cites longevity statistics (40 years in Western Europe) and says that applies globally and says that disease was a major problem. Prior to the European settlement of the America's the people were taller, and lived longer than their European counterparts. They also didn't have any of the Western Diseases (small pox, measles etc) because they lacked beasts of burden and the population density of Western Europe. Anyone who starts off a book playing fast and loose with History and with Economic theory can't be trusted to create an accurate model; and it's true. His model is riddle with flaws that other reviewers have pointed out. People like his theories because it absolves them of developed world guilt and makes the solution seem easy without much in the way of self-sacrifice. Like too many economic models, however, reality and the ideal are not the same 
 Does not do well at all in the digital cd system in my car.  Sounds horrible.  Needs remastering to conform to the new systems 
 It seems that Landes' idea of scholarship is forming a theory first and THEN find all the evidence/stories that support that theory and ignore the rest. So, medieval Europe was actually a crucible of ideas, compared to the rest of the world, because of the invention of the eyeglasses and the clock. And due to utilizing animal power, Europe didn't need as many people and hence had lower population density. This may be true, except Landes hasn't given out any evidence. One can easily counter argue that it had less people because of its lower productivity could support less people. This is true of many of the other assertions in the book.  Bottom line: biased writer with shoddy scholarship. If you want a good euro-centric read, I recommend The Rise of the West instead. McNeill at least is knowledgeable and insightful within his area of expertise. 
 Phantom of the Opera has been a huge part of my life over the years, I heard and saw many casts of the show, I bought the books, I watched the movies, you get my point. This recording does not however represent how the show actually sounds live or what this cast was capable of in London and on Bway. Since, I think, this was recorded before the show even premiered that explains the bloodless quality of the recording. It's pretty, yes, but I'm never gripped as I was by this cast when hearing & seeing live material. Crawford sounds whiny and way too fake for me here and Brightman's musgy diction and sloppy singing is a disgrace. Steve Barton is a wonderful Raoul but even he got dragged down by the sterility of this recording. I do NOT hate this cast, in my opinion the OLC and OBC are amazing but exactly WHY the show reduced me to tears is not captured on this recording. Compared to that I much prefer the OCR (Canadian cast), OSC (Swedish cast) and the film cast. None of which offers the sterile beauty of this recording but they are all pulsing with passion and gripping drama 
 For all the information about Mr. Moose instead of the sniper killers.  Mr. Moose is too hung up on his own accomplishments and racism and only gives out tidbits of information concerning the sniper killers.  Again, if this were supposed to be an autobiography, this approach would be fine. 
 If you don't know much more about Woodrow Wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. There's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. Maybe Woodrow Wilson's life is just too large for a book this small 
 I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read.  Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest.  A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book.  It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page.  What is all the fuss?  I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed.  It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple.  
 I purchased this book for classes at the community college in Arizona. Upon receiving the book, Amazon did not attach the CD-ROM that was suppose to go with it. Amazon still could not correct the order after the second try by sending me the CD-ROM that is stated in the editorial reviews. I had to return both books at there cost. Two weeks later, I am now looking for the book from another supplier. Amazon just couldn't fill the order correctly 
 Mr. Griffin has a formula.  One formula, with one character and nothing changes.  This book, the entire series, and in reality all of Mr Griffin's work is nothing more than the literary equivalent of marshmallow creme only with less flavor and nutritive value.  I recommend it for use as a soporific or in a pinch toilet tissue 
 This is a comprehensive discussion of the influence of Aristotle on the Catholic Church during the middle ages.  There is not enough about Aristotle himself, or his actual teachings, and way too much about the politics of the Church.  Throughout the book the question arose, in my mind at least: Aristotle's writings and teachings defined logic, and dialectic, and his methods helped to codify the inquisitive mind.  Why, then, were his writings used only in defense of Catholic doctrine, or in establishing offshoots of this doctrine.  Why didn't these writings make those intellectuals of the Church question some of the illogical and absurd avenues of inquiry such as how can a dead body be restored to life, or the sun stop in the sky, etc.  Why wasn't Aristotle's arguments used to move the Church away from the miracles and other fairy tales of the literal interpretation of scripture.  Aristotle, if nothing else, was a proponent of the beauty and logic of nature, and if the Church not only did not learn from him, but succeeded time after time in suppressing his writings (as noted in this book), then was Aristotle's writing actually that significant in the history of the Church.  He appeared to be anything but a positive element in the development of the Catholic Church.  Imagine what a wonderful world we might be living in if the Church had embraced the methods of Aristotle a thousand years ago, instead of practically ignoring the more important facets of his legacy, and extending their Dark Age for more and more centuries.  This book should have delved more into the positive applications of Aristotle, rather than the trivial and negative results of his great body of work. 
 You people really need to read before you assume that the occult is a bad thing. 
 I read this book two months ago and I just woke up now.   Yeah, yeah, I know: 0 out of X people found this review helpful 
 This book was absolutely REVOLTING. Not only does the hero kidnap the heroine and makes her family and fiance believe she is dead, he also rapes the heroine out of necessity so she couldn't go back to said fiance! As if this wasn't enough, he forces her to sleep with him naked, and repeatedly forces her to have sex with him until she gets used to it and starts to like it. This is nauseating as it is, but then he beats her because she disobeyed his orders. I don't care if he did it as the ship's captain, her lover (read rapist), or whatever. This is a romance novel and heroines are not supposed to be beaten, especially not by the heroes. You would think things would get better after this, but..ohhh no! She gets abducted by four men and you know what's coming next. Nevertheless, you keep thinking the hero will come to the rescue at the last second. WRONG. She gets brutally gangbang raped while one of the hero's servants is present. Not only that, she was pregnant and loses her baby when this happens, AND her skin gets ripped open (yes, THAT skin). If this scene was meant as a contrast to the first rape by the hero to show that his actions weren't really that awful, in my opinion, it is very unsuccessful. It doesn't matter how the hero raped her, if he thought he loved her or not. Countless men think they love someone. It doesn't mean they can force themselves on those people. At this point, I was ready to throw the book away, but I thought it could only improve (after all, it couldn't get worse), so I kept on reading. I suppose I wanted a happier ending. And you would think the book is near it's end, but you would be mistaken. This is only halfway through. She finds some letters and gets mad at her captor so she escapes to her fiance and has sex with him, only to realize that... oh! She is in love with her dear rapist! At which point the hero comes to recapture her. As if this wasn't bad enough, the ending of the book is completely unsatisfactory and hastily written. I cannot bring myself to understand how this is the author's favorite book! She probably has rape fantasies and is into torture. Same goes for those who liked this book. Even if people do attach themselves to their abusers in reality, I do not want to read about this in a romance novel. And I certainly don't want graphic descriptions if a gang rape! There is not ONE thing I would recommend from this book. Unless you're a masochist or a sadist, STAY AWAY 
 Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place 
 Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today. 
 This book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about Orisha Tradition, and are curious. Otherwise don't waste your time and money.. 
 The beginning of the book is very good with a perspective on scientific thinking.  The idea of blending is then clearly explained with a multitude of examples. But it is overdone with too many examples and too many question and answer discussions. One has almost the impression that the text is in fact intended as a study supplement.   But in the end one asks, isn't this all just another word for association and so what any way. It is vague in a way not to be useful.   Nevertheless the text is referenced by many cognitive linguists and is a source of inspiration apparently 
 The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a cliché cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.  BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.  PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win 
 I bought this thinking that I would get some great insights from a great sales person. Unfortunately I got Joe Girard reading his book and not reading it very well (lot's of pauses in the wrong spots and mispronunciation of words).  It was often painful to listen to but I listened to the entire package hoping the find jewels and wisdom that I could use or pass on to my sales guys. There were some nuggets and vaulable tips but not nearly enough to warrant 6 hours of listening content.  Joe needed to have a professional read the book and needed someone to do a much better job of editing each book so that we the listeners would get valuable content from each book and not the same poorly read idea, "Send 1 card to each of your prospects every month so that you stay at the front of his/her mind." This lame idea and how he executed it was presented at least twice and probably three times in the program.    I realize that this was an abridged compendium of five of his books, but the number of times that the same concept was repeated and repeated and repeated was way too much.  I hoped that each book would bring new and unique concepts forward, but that really did not happen.  My recommendation is that you buy any of Zig Ziglar's or Brian Tracy's (audio) books.  They give you a much better presentation and lots of implementable ideas, and they do it in a very professional manner.    I felt that I wasted my money on Joe 
 I liked the peformance by the actress playing Isabella. Loved her clothes and makeup. The use of modern clothes and spartan sets in a production that has an painfully low budget doesn't present a problem.   Beyond that, well, I know the director is trying to make a point about the brutal suppression of gays and possibly the government policies under Mrs. Thatcher.  It's unfortunate that the sexual scenes and extremely graphic violence are purely gratuitous.  The actors playing Edward II and Gaveston are too pretty and resemble one another to a weird degree (intentional?)  
 I really enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network, and the other recipes of his that I've tried from the Food Network website have turned out well. However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding. Thus, I'm wary of trying another recipe in the book, but if I do, I'll be a lot less blindly trusting 
 It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable 
 Storyline very contrived as Kim and Bruce profess their love for each other on a rather slick squeaky sofa/chair after one long extended blind date.  It just didn't make sense, you really have to suspend belief that their relationship barely a week old and bereft with alcoholic stupors could be genuine.  Rent it if you want, Larroquette is funny as the obsessive crazed ex-boyfriend and Bruce has fun with this as his first screen outing and Bassinger plays drunk fairly well.  But unless you can find it in a bargain bin, it's not worth buying   
 The blanket worked, for 3 weeks. Now the controller just keeps blinking E. It wont reset, it wont warm. I cannot return it to amazon, It's been longer than 30 days, as I purchased it ahead of time as a christmas gift. I wont do that again 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 the legendary musashi saga is part of the japanese culture. now the japanese even arrange tours for people who love musashi to visit stop by stop of the paths that musashi once traveled. there are numberous studies on musashi, swordsmanship and his philosophy of life and death. but according to the studies, his real maturity came after the duel with ganryu on that island but not before.  this long and slow paced 'musashi' by eiji yoshikawa was in fact written badly, there are so many irrelevent parts should be deleted, like part III, fire, from page 227 to page 290, are all these pages would have any possibility to affect musashi's later journey? the sword fighting scenes were also poorly portrayed. there are only several moments that were really sparked with energy. yoshikawa had tried lamely to convey the zenism and taoism in the early japanese era, characters were badly created, storyline dragged so long and uninterested in snail-like speed. page after page, chapter after chapter were wasted by zigzigging indirect prose that gave the translator, c. s. terry, even harder time to translate it into english.  the translation in general is also a huge failure, there's nothing excited by such rigid, complicated, word by word lifeless translation. it read exactly like from a foreign language, it never gave you a direct transformed feeling, you never warmed to the journey of musashi, it's every reader's responsibility to dig and filter out the meager deep meaning of what musashi might have really felt at those moment. sentences were translated in a very long , almost never-ending length. words chosen to match the japanese were often digged out from unpopular, rarely used english words, sentences were painfully and loyally translated like reading a textbook, rigid, lifeless and indirect. the translator never had the courage to miss even one japanese word in its original japanese form. the unflexible and rigid tanslation has further killed the already slow-motioned original japanese version. yes, some readers who got the japanese samurai and culture fevers would still love to dig in, read along with the slow paced translation no matter what.  well, all said, what could you expected in the 15th, 16th, or 17th centuries, of course everything is slow without speed. if we could explain and accept the flaws with such tolerance, both writer and translator would have undoubtedly done a great job. 
 This book is nothing special. The writing is uninspired and unimaginative. Half the book consists of the writer going into detail about what the clients are eating. Great, she can list off a random bunch of unknown and sufficiently sophisticated sounding menu items.  Most of the characters are as deep as tissue paper and they have no personality or emotion. And Lahiri's random rambling on about the minute details of the character's surroundings does nothing to advance the story, except perhaps to pad on some pages.  The other major flaw in this book is that characters make huge life altering decisions without any reason behind why they are doing it. Or for that matter, when something life altering does happen to a character, instead of showing to us how the character deals with this, Lahiri skips a year forward and assumes everything is back to normal. Where are the internal struggles that they are going through? How are they coping? Apparently that is not as important to explore as is their dietary needs. What a waste of my time. 
 This collection of stories offers nothing new in the landscape of contemporary fiction.  There is nothing unique in the prose, just the raw stuff you'd find in Tim O'Brien or Ellen Gilchrist.  The title story is the only one I liked.  I especially hated the one told from the perspective of an Australian, it detracts from the main themes too much.  There are better choices, like Rick Moody or Annie Proulx 
  This book is riddled with fallacies and very poorly organized. Although some of the ideas were interesting, it seemed like the author just made everything up! It's amazing that something like this actually got published.   I think this paragraph about the author's "trip" to one of the astral planes speaks for itself.   "Suddenly the figure of the evil Darth Vader came out of the woods... My astral sense of humor was in attendance, as I created a can of spinach, opened it with miniature lightning bolts, and consumed this can of power immediately.   Just like Popeye, my fists grew in size, and I punched Darth Vader right through his helmet..."  How stupid does the author really think we are? This obviously reflects his opinion of the readers of his book.   If you want to expand spiritually, I suggest reading something by Thich Nhat Hanh, or any author that knows what they're writing about.  
 The description for this cartridge says that it "provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria" with its "Aquastat" antimicrobial technology.  If you read the literature that comes with it, however, it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge*.  Not in your humidifier.  It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge.  Whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it 
 Starting off with the premise that this book is a review of the lives of the 200 children born of Nobel prize winning sperm donors is completely misleading to the reader.  It has been a long time since I actually felt lied to in the preamble to purchasing a book.  Readers should know that no children are born of Nobel prize winners, no examination of the lives of 200 sperm donors from the bank is undertaken and no scientific information on genetics are even discussed throughout the whole book.  In fact, even the data collection of the few lives the author does research seems adhoc at best. What this book is about is a look at some kids who find their true fathers through the help of the author, but more so through a Canadian director researching the same topic for a movie documentary.  The author seems to ride on the coattails of this director in finding out a lot of his information.  All the while he makes enormously ridiculous comments and judgments about the supposed Nobel prize winning sperm bank and genetics.  He never once looks at the topic with an open mind, that maybe, just maybe extremely bright parents might be more likely to have extremely bright children. He does some good research in unraveling the Nobel sperm bank and the people behind it.  But it seems he relies on old interviews and tv show spots from the 70s and 80s, a time when these topics of genetics and race and IQ were strictly taboo.   The book feels to me that it was trying to use the hype around a Nobel prize winning sperm bank to create a marketing buzz when infact this book is nothing but a review of what could be any sperm bank and any children born of it.  Quite disappointing. 
 The only track worth listening is "Hip-hop is dead" which is a recycled beat off of the last album and produced by number one hip hop sell-out Will I Am. For all that NAS is trying to do, he's as guilty of killing hip hop as anyone. The rest of the album sounds like he jacked beats from his old boy AZ. Sorry NAS, love you boy, but maybe you shouldn't have doubled up the last album and made two classics instead 
 what's that book about? rebellion? i don't think to be a rebel is necessary to have sex with everyone you meet, both male and female. is the intent of the author to shock you? he didn't shock me, he just disgusted me.  i didn't like this book at all, and if you are looking for a book with a meaning, you won't like this one 
 I was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the Robert Rodriguez band Chingon, but what the hell is this?!!!   The Amazon recomendations lead me to this album, and hinde sight I should have read a little more before buying, but I was too excited to hear more of the Rodriguez Chingon. I hope this helps you 
 I have used this book over the last 9-12 months to study for my part I ANZCA exam.  It is frustrating to use at times, often containing contradictory or imprecise statements.  It definately contains several errors (including but not limited to the structures of sevoflurane and etidocaine).  It is now becomming rather out of date (examiners often expect more up to date information than this).  The chapters and sections themselves are well organised, but within paragraphs organisation is often a bit lacking.  Also, the physiology section is not particularly usefull, being too brief to be worthwhile in studying for exams.  Unfortunately I do not know of any other book dedicated to anaesthetic pharmacology that covers the topics in the appropriate amount of detail without being too massive to be managable.  So we will still be forced to use it for now.  Let's hope a new edition comes out soon that is much improved! 
 I have no other option than to agree with some of the others here who have found it necessary to beat this book up a bit. It's deserved. This book is really a Flash 5 book masquerading as a MX source. There is some sprinkling of material in there, but this book should never have been able to have that title. Of course MX means sales. It's the latest & greatest at the moment. There are plenty of great MX books out there... I suggest you pick one of those books up and leave this one alone. Sorry.. 
 Nasty little book.  I have tried to find an ounce of humanity in this book, and I cannot find it.  Bill Wilson should not, in all acounts, be trusted - espcially as something as delicate as the mind.  He has an agenda, and the critics are trying to work out what it is.  I spent 2.5 years in the program, and it was like manipulative, nasty, and hopeless.  Do not underestimate the power of Alcoholics Anonymou 
 I had to read this for a class.  I just could not get into this story.  I normally love to read but this book just could not cut it.  I would not continue reading this book by choice.  I will be glad to be done with it.  The instructor could have picked a better book.  No one else in the class cares for this book either.  A waste of my money.  J. is an annoying character.   Couldn't care less about him... 
 I'm taking a course which uses this book as the main textbook, and I find its explanations poorly written.  I would suggest buying the book "Computer Arithmetic Algorithms, 2nd Edition" by Israel Koren instead, which covers the same material in a manner I find more straightforward 
 I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Blue Logger to use with a new Dell Axim X51v (which I purchased to use with the Blue Logger). I found that I could not make a Blue Tooth Connection between the Blue Logger and the handheld computer. I contacted Delorme & was told "At this time we do not offer any support or updates for Windows Mobile 5.0.  Hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe." What a ripoff. Delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present PC Handheld operating system.   I have also found that I cannot upload routes created on Street Atlas 2006 to the hand held. Basically I have a little electronic map with no functionality. 
 While Westlife has some good voices, I just don't like this album as much.  It felt like one endless power ballad to me.  Nearly all the songs copy the same cliches found in every late-80s heavy metal band power ballad by Bon Jovi, Winger, Poison or some others. Seemed like orchestral arrangements on most of the stuff Most of the ballads were surprisingly bland.  There's one or two uptempos, but that's about it.  At least Ruben Studdard remade one of their songs, Flying Without Wings, and made it sound better than them.  They're not as exciting as Backstreet, not as chance taking as NSYNC. More than Words and Swear It Again were quite good, but they're the only 2 good songs on an otherwise flat-sounding album 
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed 
 I wonder if they'll have the guts to print this...  I ordered this book April 30th, and it is now almost June.  They keep pushing back the estimated delivery date - which is now June 18th, SIX WEEKS after I purchased the book.  And I purchased it from Amazon - not one of their vendors.  I wouldn't be so upset if they simply sent me an explanation for the delay.    Ever wonder why there is no way of contacting Amazon.com?  There's no phone number, no address, and no email.  It's because they don't want to hear from you.  Once they get your money, you're on your own.  Edit: Ok, so I thought I had found a back door way to send Amazon an email.  Under review guidelines (under FINE PRINT when you are writing a review) there is a button for "contact us."  This must be an attempt to keep people from writing reviews full of Amazon hate.  But after writing a lengthy yet respectful email to Amazon, it simply bounced back "sorry there was a problem with your order - please try again later."  Oh well, I should have known it was too good to be true.  I'm sure they'll be in a big hurry to get that one fixed.  If the BOOK ever shows up, maybe I'll get a chance to review IT.  Or maybe I should just go support my local bookstore instead of another Home Depot/McDonalds/Starbucks/Wal-Mart 
 I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem. I'll spend the money for a good one next time 
 Best suited for supervisory personnel with limited experience and limited education.  Not helpful to experienced managers with some exposure to management theory and interpersonal dynamics.  Too much of a  "recipe" book 
 I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers.   It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates.   2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick.  Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now. 
 In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis.   Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing "inductivism" by "deductivism." In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results.   But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier.   The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.  Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.  Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used.  
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 Running with Scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event.  Unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful.  It is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling.    The lead character in the movie is a 15-year old.  His parents divorce, and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family.  Lead is on course to become a writer (who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based), but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer.  All the performances were serviceable, save for Gwyneth Paltrow, who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously.  Annette Benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie.  Mrs. Benning performed excellently and selflessly, but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie.  It is a sure sign that Hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term.   Also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies.  The presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters.  Furthermore, the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion, and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights.  The most promising characters are the psychoanalyst's wife and adopted daughter.  The movie has some colorful and funny scenes, but these are not enough to justify a viewing 
 This is an atrocious album, and fortunately I didn't pay much for it.  Most of the arrangements are mediocre at best, and two of the songs are not even the songs they claim to be.  The first is Track #1 which they call "El Jarabe Tapatio"... This bears NO resemblence to the traditional version at all, in fact I don't know WHAT version this is.  Further down they list the "Jarabe Mexicano" which as it turns out IS the traditional one.  I've never heard it called that.  But my biggest gripe is the track listed as "La LLorona."  This is one of the main reasons I bought this album, and I don't know how they get away with calling it that.  It is ABSOLUTELY NOT the famous song, and in fact even the words don't mention "llorona" at all.  Where the hell did their version come from?  I know what I'm talking about here.  I may not be Mexican but I was born and raised in Mexico, and this is the music I grew up with.  All in all a bad album.  I guess you get what you pay for, but in this case I think I got even less than that.  Stay away and save your money 
 The best expample of what this book is all about is his criticism of Ann Coulter (who I think needs to be criticized).  She refers to one of her books in an interview and says that the book has lots of footnotes.  Al Franken points out that there are no footnotes in the book.  Sure enough, hes' right...there are no footnotes....they're actually endnotes. She misspoke......so he calls her a liar!  And, of course, that makes everything that she says and writes a lie!  Very childish and I would suspect very damaging to his own political party 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 Let's just be honest: this film is terrible . . . and not in the way that "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" is so "terrible" that it's great . . . more like the way "Caddyshack II" is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame . . .  I was a kid when this film was released. And, while it was not particularly exciting then, it is insanely tedious now. It is a genuine test of patience . . . but with no pay-off what-so-ever.  Here's some potentially helpful information:  The slasher film can branch in two directions: supernatural (Friday the 13th II, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street etc...) and crime/revenge (I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th, TCM, Scream, Urban Legend ect...). This one falls under the latter heading. And while realism can render a more potent effect ("This could really happen!"), this film simply fails to engage the viewer ON ANY LEVEL.  The goal of a slasher film is two-fold: to horrify and repulse. This does neither!! The "horror" element is non-existent: there is no point in expounding, since there is nothing to examine.  And, if you love gore (and who doesn't?) try another film. The "murders" are barely visible (literally) and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn. Many of the film's problems are technical: the cinematography is just horrendous. The entirely film is extremely underlit, the colors are needlessly washed-out, and the film stock is grade "F." And this, as you know, is not because the film is over twenty-five years old . . . the problem was always there.  There is ONE "good" moment in the entire film . . . when the school's "bad boy" has his head lopped-off and it clumsily thunks down the prom-court walk-way. Still, it is more comic-relief than genuine horror.  The soundtrack could not BE WORSE. I am not referring to the disco tunes (we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period), but the tracks made for the film . . . they sound like they were squeaked-out by The Carpenters. So, imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster, psuedo-thoughtful ballads (like the final song on the track). Words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is!!  Did I mention that Leslie Nielson has a meaty role (yes, THAT Leslie Nielsen from Airplane, and Naked Gun)? He plays a tough-minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter. I know, it SOUNDS funny, but IT'S NOT!! Trust me!!  If you dig watching unattractive teenagers "disco the night away," hey, this film is totally for you!! But if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle-period of its reign look elsewhere (like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc...)  I'd be willing to get all Ed McMahon's Star-Search on you and give this "film" a 1/4 star. But it is an important milestone in the slasher sub-genre (I will not spoil the film and tell you why, though). So if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar, watch it . . . on picture-in-picture . . . maybe after a few drinks . . . on a day when the cable is out . . . on fast-forward! 
 this is not biography, but libel with a good motive. For an unbiased overview of the polemic about dr. B. see the review "The Strange Case of Dr. B." in the New York Review of Books, Volume 50, Number 3 ? February 27, 2003. (i found it online) 
 Althought there were 50 recipes, they were very similar, just with different fruits.  An addition to a liquor recipe collection but not for the beginner recipe collector 
 Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.  It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.  I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)  It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.   
 This is a one-time watch. It is most definately a home movie with very unprofessional editing. I was hoping for at least one or two songs to have a professional mix. Never happened.. 
 if you are into dancing, clubs, partying, etc this album is for you if you are into old school r and b this is not for you because these lyrics and tunes have been played before in different variations so its kind of old this is for the new generation who has never heard the old songs 
 Unbelievable:  	This book was hard to stomach.  I'm use to reading Protestant apologetic nonsense from those who don't claim to be theologians, but Willing to Believe is marketed as "a major work" by a guy who purports to be a "professional theologian," and yet the book is so filled with fiction that you really need to be ignorant of Christian theology to take it seriously.   Someone gave Dr. Sproul a Ph.D; one would think he would at least attempt to be professional.  Trying to align St. Augustine with Luther and Calvin, Dr. Sproul not only seriously distorts the teachings of the saint, but also the teachings of the Reformers.  Anyone who has actually read St. Augustine, Luther, and Calvin knows that the Reformers were as far from St. Augustine as were Pelagius and Nestorius.  Sadly, Dr. Sproul, Luther, and Calvin all seem to have missed St. Augustine's words in the Enchiridion; "Whosoever, therefore, says that to be a man is evil (the Reformed doctrine of man's total depravity), or that to be wicked is good (the Reformed doctrine that after justification man remains evil, as well as the Reformed doctrine of predestination to Hell prior to foreseen demerits), comes under that prophetic condemnation: Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil.  For such a man finds fault with the works of God, that is, with man, and he praises the defect of man which is iniquity.  Every being therefore, even though it be imperfect, is good so far as it is a being; so far as it is defective, it is evil" (Enchiridion 4.13).  As regards St. Augustine's stance on the ability of man to cooperate with justifying grace, Dr. Sproul insists he denied it absolutely.  Apparently he never read St. Augustine's sermon 11; "He who created you without your cooperation does not justify you without your cooperation.  He who created you without you knowing, will not justify you without you knowing" (Sermon 11.13).  As Dr. Sproul rightly points out, God creates the free act of the good within us.  But our will is not passive as he insists.  Such a view necessarily implies double predestination and the doctrine that God creates men for the sole purpose of evil, with Hell as their end - thus making God the author of evil.  Dr. Sproul tries valiantly to wriggle out of this, but he cannot escape logic without lying.  That is why he is forced into distorting the teachings of not only the Reformers, but of St. Augustine and the Catholic Church which has always insisted that God creates the free act of good within man, but in such a way that man's free will is not violated.  Even man's ability and willingness to cooperate with God's grace is caused by God.  Furthermore, even though God moves man to freely choose the good, he moves man to choose the good infallibly because due to his omniscience God is able to present to man the very grace God knows the man will not resist, even though the ability to do so remains within him.  Dr. Sproul refuses to acknowledge that what the Council of Orange condemned in semi-Pelagianism was not man's ability to cooperate with God's grace, but man's ability to make a first movement toward God without God's special grace.  When Dr. Sproul teaches that man is unable to cooperate with God in his justification, he makes God the author of evil and is teaching heresy, pure and simple.  Anyone reading this book to get a better idea of the Christian doctrine of free-will and justification should beware that Dr. Sproul is not presenting anywhere near a true picture of the history.   	Finally, Dr. Sproul presents the arguments of various Protestant theologians through the last four centuries attempting to show whether they conform to the doctrine of the Reformers.  The depth of confusion and disagreement among Protestantism renews in me a thankful praise for the guidance of the Holy Spirit offered to the Catholic Church "until the end of the age." 
 I have read all of the books up until this one, and this one is definitely the worst so far.  In fact, it makes me wonder whether I will continue to read the series.  The book is misnamed.  The Ionian mission is only the last fourth of the book.  The first three-fourths is a very boring description of two battles that came close to happening but never did.  The Ionian mission itself is fairly confusing with all of the personal names and place names bandied about.  Jack Aubrey, as in most of the other books, is burdened with an extremely difficult mission.  He must decide who to support in some kind of three-way civil war.  He makes the wrong choice, but then is called away to fight another party who has seized some British vessels.  Talk about deus ex machina!  There is nothing of much interest that happens in this book.  Stephen Maturin doesn't really do anything interesting in the espionage line, and Professor Graham is a bore.  The final battle scene is as predictable as most of the others--Jack Aubrey wins against all odds because he is a good captain.  I recommend skipping this one if you are reading through the series.  I would bet that Patrick O'Brian did not spend very much time writing this.  In fact, it seemed like bits and pieces patched together to form a "novel. 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 This movie really made no sense.  First off, there is no haunting. Second, there's no witch. Third, if the incidents were caused by a poltergeist, (i.e., the girl herself) why in the world was she torturing herself at first and not the person she really wanted revenge on.  And why would it take a year after the first "incident" for the poltergeist attacks to occur.  The opening, with the modern girl running in the woods from something was way too long and set the tone of the film: a lot of cheesy quasi terror scenes that don't make much sense and end up being boring.  I love haunted house stories, but this was not one of those. There are far better haunting stories on Discovery's "A Haunting" series. Why is it that big budget films always seem to have lousy lame scripts which the directors try to compensate for by overproduction 
 Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.   However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.   That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.   You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs! 
 This slim volumn of large print (I'm sure in order to expand the page count) was an easy read, I finished it in less than an hour.  It probably took a little longer to write.  The author is a journalist and he wrote it like an opinion piece.  I learned nothing new and consider it a waste of time.  Certainly not worth the price 
 This book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a CCNA.  This book is not good as a study guide for the exam, due to its lack of granularity on most CCNA subjects 
 Well, I'm less than impressed upon wrapping up a listen to this album.  While it has a few standout tracks among the 11 provided, for the most part they are all mediocre.  I was never a fan of `Vertigo' but I am a fan of U2 so I opted to give the entire CD a listen, and while the remaining singles `City of Blinding Lights' and `Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own' are classic U2 and wonderful listens, songs like `Original of the Species' and `Love and Peace of Else' really bring down the value of the CD.  Some of these tracks serve their purpose.  `Miracle Drug' quickly redeems the album after the dreadful opener `Vertigo' but `Love and Peace of Else' and `All Because of You' quickly knock it back down, and while `A Man and a Woman' struggles to be ballad worthy the following four tracks end the album in complete turmoil.  `Yahweh' has Bono coming off as an out of tune karaoke refugee and ends the album on such a sour note I'm almost forced to swear if off forever, but I won't do that, because they're U2 and on name alone they were saved, this time 
 We were looking for scientific, comprehensive information about fertility and conception.  We found this book to be vague and general, which is OK if you need some background on general infertility or fertility issues.  If you want a much more specific "how-to" on identifying fertile days, knowledge of fertility signs, and how to make detailed charts that will be useful for you and your doctor, then we very strongly recommend Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" instead.  
 This entire series of "Incredibly Easy" books should be called "Incredibly Boring"!  I've found all of them to be useless in keeping my attention or in helping me to remember.  There is nothing memorable about anything in these books 
 This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a  chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the  director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so  terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that  such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only  hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes 
 This book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with ASD I have a big question to the author. Where are her children now? Show the evidence they truely recovered 
 This book twists facts and constantly points the finger at the 'massa' letting down the poor. White men are said to be in a position of leadership out of 'accident of birth'. She tells us not to make, snicker, of stand for racial jokes. Then in the next chapter she tells one of her own in support of black pride. This book is absolutely riddled with contradictions. She feels it is the responsibility of you and I, through government to pay enough taxes so that there are no poor families in America. She writes that one should not feel 'entitled' to anything they didnt 'sweat' and 'work for'. Then says 'we' should 'give' to the poor instead of buying more things for ourselves. This book is absolutely ridiculous. If a white man wrote a book like this it would be dismissed as racist garbage.  
 I don't understand what the people in charge of producing "The Wiz" as a film, could get by joining the former "BIG" names of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne in this trashy picture. The music soundtrack is by far, much better than the movie itself.  I have lately become a great Soul music fan, so I recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative Soul music work, not keeping in mind that it's a "movie soundtrack". In such manner you will enjoy it more!       
 I agree with other reviewers, that there really is no relationship here.  They decide they are meant for each other after a 5 minute conversation about not much of anything.  The writing doesn't make up for the lack of interraction between them.  The "passion" falls flat and most of the book is taken up with a drawn-out conflict about whether or not the hero is crazy.  What's crazy is that this book took over 300 pages (paperback), and that I read the whole thing.  This reads more like a Harlequin romance, all fluff, no substance, and no charisma or sensuality 
 A rather boring country album...Don'tCall me Shirley is just a ratherdumb attempt at humor 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 2 months after ordering, i have year to get my first issue.  i'm sure i'll like it...if i ever get it 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 I was given this edition of Shakespeare for a Christmas one year when I was young. Once I began to appreciate Shakespeare, I did some readings in this work. It was okay.  Then it became painfully obvious: with no line numbers, no margin space for notes, abridged names, no footnotes nor any research, it became rather difficult to closely study Shakespeare with this edition.  That is when I purchased the Norton edition of Shakespeare. Although there are still abridged names, it has a very clear layout, notes, and enough margin to make anybody happy 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 Bought new ear piece for new ipod. Had Koss plugs. Panasonics are awful. Tried all the sizes. Guess I don't have the right ears for these.Koss plugs are great. Reverted back to them and have no desire to upgrade after hearing Panasonics. Are the Sony look alikes any better?? 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 If you are really interested in what happened between Turks and Armenians in 1915,i can suggest you to read Heath Lowry's The Story Behind Ambassador Morgenthau's Story.Professor Heath Lowry is a well-known historian in Princeton University and in his book,he proves Ambassador Morgenthau's Story wrong scientifically,shows how the book is based on rumors.A must to read for those who are interested in this matter.. 
 Compré este libro como regalo para mi madre y me lo devolvió a los tres días.    La tipografía usada en las pequeñas páginas es tan minúscula que aún con un vidrio de aumento es difícil de leer.  Todos los que lo han visto concuerdan que el formato pequeño del libro es totalmente inadecuado para un diccionario de esta magnitud 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 This book is horrible.   This book is outdated (it comes with a floppy disk that I havn't found to work on any computer). It also provides very few examples as to grasp what is being talked about in the material. There are also (from the limited answers provided) answers that are wrong. This book is also extremely expensive for the amount of material provided. I have seen many books provide much more information for half the price.  Just thought I'd chip in my own two cents since the other reviews seem oddly impresonal and similar (the two that are different) 
 First I want to say that I am probably the biggest Ann Rule fan, I have read every non-fiction book she has ever written...but I was shocked that she would even attempt a fictional book!  I feel there is so much REAL  CRIME out there,  why would anyone want to make up something like this up?   This was a big disappointment 
 My subscription was for a year. But the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired. I would suggest people subscribe to Good Housekeeping directly instead 
 I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it 
 This book was suspenseful at first, but soon became a "video game". Every corner turned was a new problem or a "monster". The book soon devolved into a trip down Christian Land. In the end, I feel like I was beat over the head with a Watch Tower 
 Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors. As mentioned, the mirrors are of a terrible quality. To top that, they do not stay in place when adjusted 
 When my husband developed acid reflux, it was recommended that he lower his carb intake. As long time lacto vegetarians (no fish, meat or eggs, yes to dairy), this sounded particularly challenging.  I bought 3 different low carb cookbooks from Amazon a month ago: "Low-carb Vegetarian" by Celia Brooks Brown, "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson and "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook: 80 Delicious Vegetarian and Vegan Recipes Made Easy with the Glycemic Index" by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller   After a month of consistent cooking I have rarely used Brown's "Low-carb Vegetarian" which is laden with ~50% recipes that use eggs.  There are some great recipes in there if you eat eggs though.  On the other hand, my copy of "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson is a bit dog-eared already.  Delicious, innovative recipes with new ways to use foods common to the vegetarian and wonderful exploring of unusual but easily available new veggies and protein options.  "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook"  by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller was rich with information and great recipes.  It taught me a lot.   But by far Robertson's "Carb Conscious Vegetarian" is the best.  I will say that I don't know either of these authors and am doing this to help a buyer who may be wondering which one to get...  By the way, a low carb/lower acid diet has really eased the acid reflux my husband suffers from. We eat a main meal during the day and a protein drink at night, even if working: switched when consuming. And I am starting to lose weight...  Hope this helps!        
 I was pretty disappointed with this product. The sound of the CD was not good at all 
 The pictorial part of the book is interesting.  The dateline entries are disconcerting because it has no relationship to the the pictures.  The text describing the pictures are interesting but yet some of them are inaccurate.  For example in the "Feb. 25" entry Margaret evidently gives credit to Grant for the Shiloh battle.  On the contrary because of Grant's poor performance in the field he was relieved of his field command post and was given a minor staff postion in his superior general headquarters.  This was Grant's low point and he considered in resigning from the Army because of the humiliation he received in the Shiloh battle.  But his buddy William Sherman convinced him that politics would change his fate and for him to stay on, just as Sherman had done earlier in that year when he goofed off on his field command but later regained recognition for his skills on the battlefield.  Margaret keeps referring to Jefferson Davis' micromanagement of the field commands but evidently absolves Lincoln from such meddling.  For example, in the early part of the war (before Grant became the general-in-chief), there was a 3-month period where Lincoln and his Sec. of War were directing field operations to their on-the-field generals by telegraph.  These two politician "generals" failed miserably and needlessly killed a lot of Union soldiers by their inept field orders.       In this book there is no order in the manner which the Civil War story is told; it is helter-skelter pieces of information that are tied together incoherently. I think there are far better books on the Civil War;  don't waste your time on this book 
 I bought this based on the excellent reviews and was very disappointed. We played it at a gathering and no one wanted to continue the DVD after the first 8-10 minute 
 Another animal based fantasy novel with a medieval setting, Perloo the Bold is your typical, concrete book of this genre. Perloo, a Montmer, leads a normal and quiet life at first. Then, he is summoned by the Montmer leader and framed with the queen's death. Perloo must overcome this through a series of battles and other conflict.  My personal feelings on this book is that it is far too mundane in plot and lacking in description, and that it is an overall bore. The plot is predictable and the vocabulary limited. Perhaps younger audiences would appreciate this book more than I.  I would recommend this book to younger audiences interested in fantasy, if anyone. If you're looking for the same style book, but higher quality, I would have to suggest Brian Jaques books from the Redwall series 
 At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt. 
 Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment. Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do.  At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 ...and forgotten. Raw and ragged. Cliche-ridden. I consider albums like "Highway 61 Revisited", "Bringing It All Back Home", "Blonde on Blonde", "Blood on the Tracks" and hell, even "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" as worthy of five stars. Sorry, but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces. Those albums are deemed 'classics' for a reason. That said, I'm not at all a fan of the Band or many of Dylan's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album 
 I rate the Belkin 6 port hub a zero. I installed exactly as instructed to my G5 tower. Plugged in 3 external hard drives and an iSight camera. Not one device showed up on my desktop and iSight didn't work at all. I tried a different firewire port on the G5 still nothing.   To boot, the port screwed up my hard drive. I couldn't shut down or restart the usual way. When I finally got the G5 restarted my menu bar was missing. It took several shut downs and restarts to make things right.  Don't take a chance with your compute 
 I have years of courtroom experiences. There was a time when I had a high opinion of attorneys and judges. But now I'm convinced anyone can be a lawyer because so darn many of them are stupid. And lawyers become judges because they cant make an honest income lawyering. Over the years I have witnessed some incredible performances by lawyers and judges. I recall one judge who came down from the bench and gave the defendant a big hug just before the trial started. Other judges are clueless about the law. And some make it up as they go, issuing orders that cannot be obeyed because theyre illegal. Lawyers are terrified of judges and the harm a judge can do to their careers, so lawyers tend to take care of themselves before they worry too much about you. Feinman doesnt address any of this. I'm guessing he doesnt get outside the classroom very often. It's a whole nuther world out there 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 This book is SO boring just like any other Ann Rinaldi book except for "The Coffin Quilt" it was pretty good. Don't waste your time reading it because after a month you'll forget what happened in the book 
 The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!   Moral: Don't waste your money 
 I don't 'get' why so many people think so highly of this book. I was one of the M&A folks at Cisco, doing mostly A. It wasn't so structured, nor so successful, nor so wonderful. We just did the best we can -- each deal is different.  Nice to have the name, the money, market share, etc. Made it much easier to get an acceptable deal. If I were on the other side of the table, life would have been less nice.  The author's uncritical look at the Cisco way makes me suspect that (a) he just didn't know or (b) he was paid off 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 For such a slim volume - only 175 pages with generous margins - author Sonia Shah attempts too much in trying to explain the vast story of oil. She starts with the geological story of how oil is formed and the incredible energy-efficient punch it delivers. In her preface, Shah writes that in oil, we encountered "one of the most versatile, energy-intense substances ever known."  It's hard not to respect how harvesting this fossil fuel has transformed the world and literally powered global advancements including higher standards of living in industrialized nations uniquely positioned to capitalize on its enormous benefits. This "black gold" is primitive in nature and it spawned a brutal survival of the fittest contest in extracting and utilizing its resources.   But trying to explain the geopolitical story of oil is where Shah attempts too much in too short a format when describing the  forces driving supply and demand on the world oil stage. On Pg. 154, she states that the United States' invasion of Iraq was originally going to be called Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) but was quickly renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom so that its "oily ramifications" wouldn't be discerned. Regrettably, this explosive "fact" isn't sourced despite her otherwise extensive footnotes. The "Blood for Oil" argument is a compelling and troubling one that demands a fuller and more rigorous vetting.  The important geopolitical story of oil deserves to be told, but isn't in this abbreviated format. 
 I was looking forward to reading this but was not able to finish the book. There is no hint of objectivity in this work. The sole purpose seems to be to praise blacks. Toward that end the book is a stream of quotes that have only one thing in common--they say something positive about blacks. There is little attempt to analyze or coordinate these quotes. Quotes will be taken from authors who disagree with many of Jackson's theories but that doesn't bother him as long as the quote meets his immediate needs. It appears that he'll use any quote from any source without attempt at analysis if it meets his limited objectives.  Jackson inserts his own unexamined opinions often without any attempt at analysis. Any work based solely an attempt to promote one race is doomed to failure and this is no exception 
 Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous!

 This is one of my favorite PKD books, so as far as a review of the story itself, it is incredible.  A must have for every seeker in the cosmos.  Now, having said that, I bought this edition, and was saddened deeply that it is unreadable.  There is a huge portion of the story which is missing altogether, (perhaps 10 - 15 pages?), and in it's place is some modern political essay about the European economy.  A publisher's mistake, I'm sure, but I can't have the only one like this.  If you can find a different edition or version of this book, then by all means buy it.  Then it would be 5 stars rather than 0 stars.  
 The worst movie ever made. I actually sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better. The acting was beyond awful, the story was a joke. I honestly was blown away at how terrible it was, do NOT waste your money or time on this movie 
 Here is a little background info. I am an IS Auditor that just took the June 2006 exam. To prepare for the exam I read this book and ISACA materials (Questions & Answers manaual and an older CISA review manual). After taking the exam, I can tell you that this book is too basic to be of any real help (maybe good for an introduction). As a matter of fact I probably would have not stood a chance of passing the exam just using this book (will find out if I passed in 8 weeks and I feel good about my chances).   You are better off using the CISA review manual 20xx (insert current year) and CISA questions, answers and explanations manual (CDROM questions is best I have heard,   The questions in this book are poorly written (I imagine deadline to release this book before June exam, I expect another version to come out soon), I imagine including a CD-ROM with questions is a ploy to sell the book to people looking to save a few bucks (ISACA CDROM + Review manual = 250+, this book and CDROM = 40+ on Amazon, don't take the bait).   Think about it, chances are you spent over 400 bucks just to register for the exam. Might as well spend an extra couple of hundred more and get the actual materials that will help you pass the exam. (Trust me you don't want to have to retake this exam cause you failed it, the actual exam will take you 2-4 hours to complete, has 200 questions and you must get a score of at least 75% using their method of scoring to pass) Reading this book alone will not help u get anywhere near that score.   Anyways, the book does have some real-world examples (great stuff) that are useful and I bet the authors could do well teaching a CPE course. However, for someone looking to pass the next exam, use the ISACA stuff and thank me later.  PS I can't imagine how any reasonable people (that are not the authors) would rate this book a 5 so take the positive reviews with a grain of salt. I am speaking from actually taking the exam that this book did not help me pass the exam at all.  Update:  I passed the exam and it was not thanks to this book. Had I used this book alone, I would have FAILED. use the Isaca books from www.isaca.org. This book is only good for an intro to IS Auditing.  Best Wishes on taking the exam : 
 I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because... I may have used the wrong settings when taking photo's.  But... I ended up with "a lot" of blurred and fuzzy photo's. "example... when we went bowling, almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks." My Biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use. You might expect that out of a $30 Dollar Camera but "NOT" a $3 Hundred Dollar one. I paid $284.99 for the camera, $47.99 for the 1 GB SD Memory Card and $51.54 for the Docking Station and that didn't include S&H or Taxes, they were extra $$$! My husband replaced this one for me with the Kodak EasyShare C743 and G600 printer dock and it's a 7.1 MP and it takes better quality pictures that I can print @ home for less then this one. ($249.95 W/FREE Shipping & Handling and 1 GB SD Memory Card included) from K O D A K online 
 I have often joked that I would rather read Umberto Eco's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels. In this book, Eco goes to prove me wrong. Eco has written a book that is a struggle to read, not because it is deep, complex, and rich but because it is an utter bore.  The story tells of the case of Yambo, a rare-book dealer living in Milan. Yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. In his case, he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read. Curious. But Eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect. For example, Yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant. Yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react. He need not have worried, because like everyone else, she treats him with no mention of the past. Yambo's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and Yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets. The end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on.  Yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories. Yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements. "A lovely snail-shell structure still steaming." I was underwhelmed. Yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books. But none of this seems to go anywhere. In fact, it seems more like an excuse for Eco to discuss (although not in any detail), pre- and post-World War II Italian novels that Eco fondly remembers.  The book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then I just wished the book would end. I cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through. Eco has done much better. If you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that Eco is, indeed, fallible. Otherwise choose one of his other books instead 
 I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.  Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.   Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.  But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised?? 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 Cute describes these books in the 10-mintues-a-day series.  Pleasant, a little fun, a little insipid.  But, really, not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study.  Actually--in contrast to more than one other reviewer--I found the word-substitution presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory.  This is not an untried method, being also used in the EasyLearn Language audio programs, and other texts.  Those word stickers don't stay on too long, though.  Be prepared to lose a lot of them 
 I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left.   BIG Dissapointment.  Don't waste your $$ 
 I was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i didn't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering, it SHOULD be the same thing you're looking physically the thing you're gonna buy!!! i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIPÈS. its very easy to put a picture of the product!!  regard 
 A glowing ball of weird light that turns people evil.  A computer in love with its creator.  Two people go into a hyperspace pod, one comes out pregnant.  Sphere meets Knight Rider meets some bizarre Star Trek episode.  Waste of time, unless its late night television, even then, try not to think, or you'll be very disappointed 
 Now That's What I Call Christmas Volume 1 is better.  Volume 2 has offerings from current pop stars that lack the warmth and staying power of Christmas classics on Volume 1 from Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Burl Ives, Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole, etc.  Buy Volume 2 if you can't find Chuck Berry's "Run Rudolph Run" or Jose Feliciano's live version of "Feliz Navidad" anywhere else; otherwise skip this hackfest 
 I came to this book as a teacher of the history of ancient philosophy, and the consideration of whether this book would offer anything that would warrant a change in the curriculum I teach.  I'm sorry to say that the answer is "no."  First, a remark on the word "philosophy."  The word is of Greek derivation, and was used initially to refer to a tradition of thought that began within Greek civilization.  This tradition was defined by no central doctrinal beliefs, but by a method of approach to establish belief.  The features of the method were as follows: (1) the central aim was to seek "wisdom" or understanding, (2) a view that traditional beliefs were largely irrelevant to this search-philosophy was a tradition that rejected the authority of tradition, and thus (3) the consequent encouragement of originality of thought, and a critical outlook on the ideas of earlier thinkers within the tradition, and (4) an insistence that any beliefs recommended for adoption should be offered with reasons, evidence, argument that could at least potentially convince any reasonable person that the belief should be adopted.  It is this tradition, in antiquity traced back to the Greek philosopher Thales, that has continued through the centuries of western culture, giving rise eventually in the modern world to natural science as well as philosophy as an ongoing concern.  In the twentieth century particularly, scholars have recognized that many other cultures have traditions of thought that share many of the features of "philosophy" as described above, and might thus in a broad sense legitimately be called by the same name.  Thus there has flourished a lively scholarship over many decades in Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy, Native American philosophy, etc.  Courses are taught in these areas on most university campuses today.  I must admit that to my knowledge there is less such studies dedicated in this vein to "African philosophy," and hope that more becomes available.  Onyewuenyi's project, however, is not one of this sort at all.  His project is to place African, and in particular Egyptian thought, firmly into the philosophical tradition in the narrower sense described above.  His central thesis is that the original Greek philosophers of that tradition were teaching Egyptian philosophy; that before Thales we must recognize Egyptian thought, and that there is a virtual identity, with some Greek flourishes, of Greek philosophy with Egyptian thought.  Does he succeed?  Not at all.  In fact the book might be better understood as a demonstration to the denial of it's thesis than a confirmation.  One central problem is methodological.  Onyewuenyi argues on the basis of a certain principle, clearly used time and again though he never states it.  The principle could be stated, however, in this way: "Proof of intellectual influence is proof of identity of belief."  One place this principle is utilized is when Onyewuenyi notes how legitimate scholars have recognized how the pre-Socratic philosophers influenced the Socratics (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle) (225-233).  After noting these influences, Onyewuenyi offers the bold statement "These philosophers [the Socratics] . . . are the pre-Socratics" (233).  Why Onyewuenyi adopts this principle is clear.  The Egyptian material that he offers for his argument is on the face of it so discordant with pre-Socratic philosophy that there is little chance of convincing the reader that the Greek philosophers were simply repeating what the Egyptian's had already said.  It is a lesser task, however, to show intellectual influence.  So if one might convince the reader of influence, then by invoking the principle that influence proves identity one gets Onyewuenyi's thesis, repeatedly stated, that the Greek philosophers were simply teaching Egyptian philosophy, as a fait accompli.  But the problem, of course, is the principle is absurd on the face of it.  By this principle we would have to infer that Newton's physics is simply Copernicus's astronomy; that Darwin's theory of natural selection is simply a reiteration of Malthus, etc.  Enough said.  What of the evidence of influence?  I would have to make the judgment that any unbiased person who was not predisposed to accept Onyewuenyi's thesis at the outset could not be in the least convinced.  What we are given on the Egyptian side is a genre of thought familiar to any student of culture: creation myths.  Myths of the creation of the world couched in anthropomorphic themes (the gods which begat other gods that finally begat the world) that are entirely out of character with Greek philosophy.  There is indeed an analogue in Greek tradition to this material-the traditional gods of the Greek pantheon, and the creation myth recorded by Hesiod which records gods begetting gods, which finally explain the world and humankind.  But the point must be stressed: this is precisely the sort of tradition-bound, conservative, and religious thought that the Greek tradition of philosophy rejected.  To be precise, this genre does not share the features (2)-(4) that define the Greek philosophical tradition.  The best that Onyewuenyi can do with the material is to cite isolated words and here and there what sounds to be a homological concept between the two traditions.  For example, Thales speaks of water, as do the Egyptian myths.  What Onyewuenyi carefully avoids is the fact that for Thales water is the constituent of all things.  For the Egyptian myths, however, water is the primordial source of all things.  The difference is in fact a chasm: an attempt to understand the basic constitution of physical reality as opposed to a speculation as to the origination of all reality.  The projects are entirely different.  All they have in common is a word, "water" in their respective languages.  A further problem is the numerous factual errors in the study.  I'll allow the knowledgeable reader to trace these.  
 Democracy, for Sean Wilentz in The Rise of American Democracy, is solely a question of politics. This is, after all, an explicitly political history of the early republic and, in his discussion of how revolutionary Republicanism evolved into a popular, though imperfect, democracy, Wilentz is concerned with democracy in specifically political terms. While this gives the book an admirable focus, he somehow manages, in almost 1000 pages, to tell only part of the story. What Wilentz succeeds in doing is writing a heavy, old-fashioned book driven by an odd teleological sense of American exceptionalism.  Significantly, The Rise of American Democracy is a political history focused almost exclusively on the great political leaders of the early republic. Although Wilentz devotes some time to discussions of popular political movements like the anti-Masonic party and the Workingmen's parties of the eastern port cities, their role is as a catalyst for the emergence of party politics. The political motivations of their leaders and militants are relevant to the extent that they influenced the development of Jacksonian Democracy, but Wilentz is not particularly interested in what democracy meant to the Workie rank-and-file.  This is a particularly odd omission, given the populism of the Jacksonian ideology. Indeed, the Jackson Democrats positioned themselves as the party of the working man and the yeoman farmer, and defined their program in clear opposition to perceived revenant Federalist commercial aristocracy, particularly in regards to the Second Bank of the United States and trade policy. The economic crises of 1819 and 1837 are political issues, ushering in, respectively, an "Era of Bad Feelings" and the decline of Federalism, and a crisis in Jacksonian Democracy and the rise of the Whig opposition. What these crises meant in social terms to the working people and farmers in social and cultural terms, Wilentz doesn't say.  To be fair, that's mostly because he is interested in American democracy in political, and not economic terms, and from a national perspective. Social issues and local, class-based agitation, while significant as an influence on Jacksonian ideology and strategy, is a small part of his story. The central tension in The Rise of American Democracy has to do with balancing local and sectional interests and grievances with an emergent democratic nationalism. Consequently, the central drama in this section of the book revolves around the conflict between Andrew Jackson, and his national vision, and John C. Calhoun's evolving sectionalism.  Not surprisingly, Jackson is the towering figure in this section of Wilentz's book, and it is in his presidency that the author locates both the democratization of the American republic and the source of most of the political currents and issues that would define American politics throughout the 19th century. Indeed, Wilentz does nothing to conceal his sympathies and admiration for Jackson. He is inclined to forgive Jackson's Indian policies as being motivated, essentially, by good intentions, and he mostly ignores the fact that he was a slave owner and a defender of slavery. While dismissing earlier historians' contentions that the Jackson's policies were inconsistent and that he "trapped himself in some large contradictions," Wilentz argues that the president pursued a consistent, though not always successful program of nation-building: "In fact, Jackson, drawing on long-established beliefs, carved out a coherent and principled democratic nationalism on basic constitutional issues." (382)  For Wilentz, by the 1830s, democracy was "ascendant," and even the most aristocratic Federalists had begun to see it as a necessary evil. Universal white male suffrage was almost universal - with the notable exception of Virginia - and there was a general agreement that government was a manifestation of popular sovereignty. The sticky issue in the dispute between Calhoun and Jackson was whether that sovereignty was manifested by the state or the nation as a whole. Significantly, though Jackson successfully quashed the nullification crisis and the state interests were accommodated to national interests through measures like the Missouri Compromise, it was a tenuous modus vivendi at best.  Indeed, the politics of the early republic were very much a question of imperfectly accommodating southern sectionalism within emerging national parties. Both the Democrats and the Whigs sought to bridge sectional differences while seeking broad popular support for increasingly divergent political programs. The failure of the Jacksonian Democrats, in fact, to maintain themselves as "the party of popular sovereignty" (515) against the rise of a trans-sectional Whiggism was very much an inability to understand how complex ideas of popular sovereignty had become.  The Rise of American Democracy is very much a history of the minute details of American politics in the period, from the Eaton affair to the shifting and evolving political philosophies of Jackson, Calhoun, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. The problem is that the book is so concerned with the details that Wilentz sometimes loses the bigger picture. For example, slavery and its expansion is a significant issue throughout the period, and Wilentz devotes a considerable about of space to abolitionist agitation and the tensions the issue produced in national politics. But though he connects the political issue of slavery to the political issue of states' rights and the fortunes of the nascent political parties, he fails to situate it as a significant social issue with deep contradictions with American democracy.  Ultimately, this is a "great" book only in the sense of its physical heft 
 This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's "Stronger Than Death" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of "All For You" and "13 Years Of Grief" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of "No More Tears" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. "Like A Bird" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and "Blood In The Well" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story

 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Press edition of "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" I was quite  disappointed with "The Story of King Arthur and His Knights". Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in "Robin Hood", the characters of "King Arthur" seem flat and lifeless by comparison.  The King Arthur stories read like little more than a description of events; one doesn't really get a feeling of being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood." The dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I think there's more to it.  The writing style in "King Arthur"  I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."  
 I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I read the review from 2005 and hoped that was just one bad batch--but it isn't.  The lid is slightly too large and if used on a non-stick pan will damage the non-stick surface since it sits on that instead of the lip of the pan.  So, I have returned it.  Note that this is just a problem with the 8 inch lid; I also bought the 10 inch lid and that one fits perfectly 
 I have been an avid Daphne du Maurier fan for 30 years. I had never read this book until a couple of weeks ago. I found it very disappointing and boring. Her books usually have that "du Maurier" feel to them, but not so in this case. She was a brilliant writer but this did not grab me at all. Her last novel 
 These Folks are obviously exellent at playing their instruments. They do not,however have any sense of this music at all. Every piece is approached in the same way.This is the worst  recording of this music I've ever heard. There is no definative approach to this music,save the composers impromptu recordings. If you're interested in the music of Gurdjieff/DeHartmann-pass this one by.For more recent recordings,try Alain Kremski 
 I recently received this as a gift for my birthday.  After reading the title, I was anxious to study the pages of the book to gain a wealth of knowledge to enhance my craft.  I was very disappointed.  You'd think with a title like "Portable MFA in Creative Writing" this book would have a lot to offer.  It only has about 30 pages per section, though.  Since my main focus is fiction, I read through that section only to find information that I had read in several other books already.  I skimmed through a couple of the other sections, but they didn't even provide much new information, and I admit to knowing little about the other genres.  So, if you are interested in several different genres and are just starting out, buy this book.  If not, buy something else.  If you're interested in fiction, I suggest anything by John Gardner (or if you want something more contemporary "Story" by Robert McKee; true, it's specifically about screenwriting, but it has a lot to offer writers of fiction, too).  To the publishers of this book, I recommend you change the title to "Survey of Creative Writing. 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 The wireless connection on this mouse and keyboard is absolutely horrible.  With fresh batteries (changed several times) and having the pod close or far from the keyboard or mouse doesn't make any difference. The mouse is jittery and jumping right and left because of bad connection, even resetting it doesn't work.  The keyboard has the same problems, with a message popping up on the screen continually.   Avoid this product 
 I guess I'm glad some "sissies" are loud and proud, but I have a problem with calling anyone a sissy.  The book is amusing enough, but it leads to terrible stereotyping if children really take its message to heart.  Basically, it says not only that it's okay to be gay (and I'm sure it is, because the media keeps telling me so), but then here's how you identify the gay people in your own neighborhood - boys who don't play sports well (or don't play at all), boys who dress up in mommy's clothing (as if mommy dresses in just frilly stuff these days), boys who like to cook (we would have starved in college if we hadn't figured out how to cook), et cetera et cetera.  Oh, I get it - we're all sissies! Is that any way to treat your prospective customers, calling them sissies???  I think not.  Quit calling me names, big-nose 
 I struggled for days with this. A big problem is the lack of feedback (e.g. led flash) when you enter codes, select device, etc.If  you do it correctly, all is well. If not, it does not control the device, but you don't know what's wrong (key not pressed hard enough, wrong code number etc). I finallly programed my tv and dvd, but could not control the Time Warner digital cable box,despite reprograming the cable key to digital cable (not an obvious thing to do) after calling Sony. I appreciate the feedback on this site mentioning that the set key has to be pressed hard. I later got a Sony rmv710, which is big, but worked well 
 In trying to get it set up, I went through multiple help technicians, most of  whom were difficult to understand   All that was accomplished was to mess up our internet connection, and then was told that my ISP would have to straighten out the problems Belkin created. One technician was honest enough to admit that the install disc was practically worthless.  Otherwise, it was nothing but a headache of waiting on the phone, being cut off, being shuttled around, and getting nothing done.  We did finally have good success, with another product 
 I made it about half way through this one before i said, "This is the worst book i have ever read".  (And i have read a bunch of books).  I am just sorry there is no rating below one star 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 What the hell happened to music?  How these no talent fools are popular should be a Nova episode. This guy has to be THE worst singer ever. He sounds like an American Idol throwaway. PEOPLE, this is not good music, don't be brainwashed by these MTV babies. Sugar Ray, Go Away!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book is a constant barrage of difficult names and convoluted information; and too little organized information on his battles. Suddenly your there and then gone, thinking, well it said something about it was a  benificial out-come for Frederick--didn't it? It was a mess, really--I read  only half. Two stars because of the topic 
 The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them.   The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite 
 I foolishly purchased 7.0.  It worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system.  Funny, it started hanging up when 7.5 was released.  I tried to get "customer support" but that's a joke.  Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROXIO.  I'd given this software negative stars if I could.  Spend your money elsewhere.  
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 A poor excuse for a children's book. It is a blatant sermon that beats the reader over the head with Christianity. There is no real plot, story or intrigue, only a thinly veiled version of the writers belief that there is only one true religion and Christianity is it. 
 If you like movies that get reviews titled "Low-Grade Bat Guano," this movie is for you.  All others, please beware 
 For Matchboxes, very difficult to find and reasearch based on a proprietary numbering system.  Numbering system not clearly articulated in overview.  I had to purchase a new "Matchbox specific" guide from another publisher.  
 The story is not only rather boring, and overly descriptive (I am an Anne Rice fan by the way) but by the end you're left asking...¨So why did this ghost come around?  And uh...his life wasn't THAT tragic...and honestly what was the POINT of this story???¨  There are so many loose ends that you'll find yourself scratching your eyes out wishing you hadn't went past the first chapter of which you were already thinking Ï hope this gets better 
 I am planning a trip to Washington, DC, in September 2006.  In order to prepare for my trip and gain insight on the many attractions in the nation's capital, I purchased the "Eyewitness Travel: Washington, DC" guide from Amazon.com in the month prior to my trip.    I was expecting to find a non-partisan, non-political guide that would not pander to any agenda or movement (we get enough of that from the liberal news media every day, and every time we go to the movie theater, as we are force-fed leftist, politically-correct propaganda spewed by the "cultural elite").  Boy, was I wrong!  The first few pages deal with the history of Washington, DC, with pictures of the various protests over the years, from women's sufferage, to anti-Vietnam War rallies, and anti-Persian Gulf War demonstrations.  At first this didn't concern me, until I recalled the numerous pro-life rallies that have taken place in DC, drawing tens of thousands of anti-abortion opponents on an annual basis.  Or how about the many "support the troops" (pro-war) rallies that have occurred in 1991 and since the 2003 liberation of Iraq (and I am a member of the Army National Guard, by the way)?  None of those pictures were shown, but then again, that wouldn't be very PC.  Pertaining to security, page 212 of the guide attempted to minimize Washington, DC's notorious crime problems, stating: "Although as in any major city there is crime, Washington has made great efforts in reducing problems and cleaning up its streets, and with great success".  That's news to me, because Washington, DC remains one of (if not THE) murder capitals of the nation, with crime beginning to affect some of DC's more elite neighborhoods and tourist areas.  In late July 2006, news coverage spoke of increasing robberies, muggings, assaults, and rapes at or near the Mall, mainly during late evening and night hours.  As for cleaning up the streets, I hope that DC has made progress since my last visit there in the summer of 2003, as the block behind the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building (10 Street NW) was riddled with homeless people and the sickening sight and smell of human waste.  But then again, it would be very un-PC to focus on DC's crime and homeless problem.  The kicker was when I flipped to page 203 and viewed the "cultural events pages".  Mixed in with the area theaters, opera halls, ballets, clubs and bars, was a seperate section naming the location of three of DC's "well-known" gay bars.  Again, political correctness is force-fed to us, as the gay agenda finds its way into a tourist guide.    In all, the guide was very informative with detailed information about the many things to do in the nation's capital and surrounding area, but why was such a liberal slant allowed to ruin an otherwise very enjoyable and helpful booklet.  If I had known this, I would not have purchased the "Eyewitness Travel" guide to Washington, DC 
 My wife and I tested this chair at a Linens and Things. We were interested since we both have bad backs. The main problem we both complained about is the chair doesn't seem to be designed for the people who could get the most good out of it, i.e. those with bad backs. It is so low to the ground it is almost impossible to get in or out of without pain. Many old people, of course, have back problems and it is difficult for them to get down close to the floor where this chair sits 
 I read this as a greek woman who does not consider herself "the typical greek". Which means that if you asked every person in my life if they thought I would "go greek", every person would say with 100% certainty that I would remain indepedent. With all that being said, I picked up this book for a good light read about a world that I myself sometimes do not feel completely comfortable in. The book was terrible, I had to push myself to finish it because all of the characters were so flat and unlikeable and the writing was so green. Most people will read this book because of the back cover summary and the close up of the pledge's chests in their P.U.'s (personal undergarments) on the front.  If you have to read it, borrow a friends copy or from the library - please don't reward this author. 
 According to this book, the way to have a "Priceless Wedding for under $5000" is to rope your friends and family into footing much of the bill by providing to you, free of charge, catering services, music, photography, ceremony and reception locations, flowers... and so on.  In the price breakdowns in the book, huge ticket items are not even counted as costs if someone other than the bride or groom writes the check or does the work.  Oh, and items bartered for are also counted as a "free" items.  Also, the rings, the honeymoon, "pre-wedding" stuff, such as the rehersal dinner, are not counted in the cost. Finally, some of the figures in the sample budgets are totally unrealistic.  For example, in at least one incident, under stationary (for 100+) the total would not even pay for the postage (invitation, RSVP, thank-you notes) let alone the stationary itself.. 
 Seagal teams up with a rapper, again. Plays slappy hand/paddy cake fighting with some guys. Escapes from prison (always fun). Then blows some stuff up. And finally, copies Bad Boys as much as it can before it races to a close.    "Today You Die" is a movie that goes a long way in showing that one picture is worth at least a thousand letters of hate mail.  Write in and tell Steven Seagal to give the rest of the money he would spend on making movies to the homeless and dedicate the rest of his creative energy into ending world hunger, saving those trees he cares so much about, or getting a hair cut so he doesn't look like the Count from Sesame Street after he wakes up after a full day of drinking beer and eating cheetos in his trailer. To tell you the truth, I actually like Steven Seagal. But his stuff is getting worse. Trying to watch his films now is like trying to read cursive from a cerebral palsy sufferer.  Do you even care about your work anymore? As for the three writers (and one who wisely wanted to remain uncredited) who put this masterpiece of gratuitous violence, cursing, and aimless wandering together, if you guys can call yourselves writers, then the guy who decided to put "Famously Fresh" on the top of Planter Cashews Nuts can call himself a writer. Why did you put the psychic woman in the film! You guys must have smoked some crack after you wrote yourself into a corner. Have you ever heard of continuity? Well, maybe having the little girl at the beginning and at the end of the movie was an effort at that. Good Job on that one boys! You confused most of your audience again b/c the girl has no significant meaning to Seagal's character except that she is in the film for him to hug. Or maybe you were just trying to tell me that he is a deadbeat dad/friend/uncle (who is she?) who only cares about this girl in a superficial way. I'll buy it then. Nevertheless, when you write another script, here's a hint about the whole girl signifying a return to family/normal life thing: have Seagal call her/look at a picture of her when he's alone/bring her up in a conversation. Or actually put her in the movie in a significant way. Just a small suggestion.  
  I do not recommend this book to any mother who is happy, healthy, and serious about her life.  This book is very negative, bitter, and depressing.  The advice isn't anything ground breaking or out of this world. In fact much is just common sense.  This book expresses a very anti-child view, caters to capitalism, and isn't inclusive of other ethnic groups and middle to lower income couples. This is the worst book I've ever read and I feel very sorry for people who choose to think like this and live this this 
 The first thing that came to my so called mind after the completion of this film was, "What was Terry Zwigoff thinking?"  He is responsible for the documentary of Robert Crumb entitled `Crumb', which was one of the better films made in the last two decades.  `Bad Santa' was a very big surprise as well, so I am caught scratching my head as to why he decided this particular script and/or subject matter was worth making a feature presentation over.  For starters, people who are serious artists and who over-emphasize the importance of their craft are the most annoying people on the planet.  I can say that because I went through a department with this type of person.  They are self indulged and think so highly of what they're trying to say that it irritates me just thinking about it.  The fact is...they have nothing to say and what they are doing has very little significance to people who actually have talent (ie, those of us who don't need to "say" anything).  If Zwigoff focused on this and made a mockery of the entire `art-scene', that might be enough to make a entertaining film, but there isn't enough in here, really.  `Art School Confidential' gets too boggled down in a courtship where the main kid seemingly finds his first infatuation in a figure model at school.  The two of them are so uninteresting that it made me yearn for some art school-critique talk from some of the hippies in the film.  It tried too hard to go over the top with some of it's jokes (male models walking up to female students where her eye level is at his pelvis level, the obnoxious roommate who offers nothing but `can I smell your finger' quirks).  It would have been nice if the story actually followed this student, who knew he was better than everyone else (and he was), ridicule the rest of the students who had absolutely nothing to offer the world (which is, essentially, about 98% of all "artists").  Instead it turns into your standard, boy tries to impress girl by stealing someone else's artwork who just happens to be a serial killer story.  Wrong direction.  There are/were too many opportunities to make fun of these types passed up for something that's been overdone way too many times.  Terry should have known better!  There is a very entertaining Thanksgiving Dinner scene, which was worth two stars from me.  The overbearing female who takes her artwork way too seriously even though it's complete trash was also amusing, so that earns two stars.  Just not enough irritating art-scene comedy in here to recommend it at all 
 Holly, you are the true jerk. This book is a PC sociology tome masquerading as a historical overview of Halloween. Alexander's okay, Holly; you're not.  
 The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah. There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together.  I would not recommend bothering with this book.  
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 Sandy Weill's book is doing worse than the autobiography of Jonathan Knee called the Accidental Banker, and which is itself a very poorly crafted effort. The reality is that Sandy Weill is the most influential banker since JP Morgan, and yet his autobiography has sunk like a stone. Major bookstores are offering it at a 50% discount, that too a month before Christmas. I would wait until the unsold books just show up for free.  One reason is the prose, among the most boring and losely edited ever written. Judah Kraushaar may be a colleague of Sandy Weill but he is a research analyst and a very boring style of writing.   Second reason is that Sandy Weill appears to be a doer not a thinker, and he can hardly focus in on the key events in his life to make it any interesting to the reader. It is like a newspaper clip without the interesting gossip.  Third, the book misses out the details about which hotel had which meeting and what Sandy thought and what he got and all that juicy stuff that a ghost writer can ferret out with care. Judah Kraushaar has simply reconstructed a story almost from the daily appointment book of Sandy Weill. The only big stories in the book are all already written in the major newspapers, so the effort adds nothing.  Four, something is amiss, because even if the employees of Citibank had bought the book it would have skyrocketed to #1. For the book to not even break the Top 500 books on amazon and to sit on #3500 so soon after release shows there is a clear repulsion by the market to the book. Most people would have just bought the book to keep on the shelf.  But my advice is to leave this one out. A good biography of Sandy Weill is still to be written but it has to be done by someone who knows how to build a theme to the story, not an aggregation of data.  
 Pat Conroy's first literary effort does provide us with far too brief glances of the writer he would become with his future efforts like The Lords of Discipline and Prince of Tides. The Boo is a biography of an Assistant Commandant of The Citadel when Conroy was enrolled at the South Carolina military college. The book does too little in the way of actual factualizations of Lt. Colonel Courvoisie's life, but chooses instead to focus on descriptions of the large amounts of memorabilia and paperwork that The Boo was involved in during his term at The Citadel.     While it is clear that Colonel Courvoisie was a fascinating individual and worthy of the respect Conroy and others have given him, the God-like status he is provided is a bit much to swallow.     I'm glad Conroy left the biogrsphy format behind and focused his future efforts on fiction. His later books are a wonderful and significant contribution to the literary world. This one can be left behind 
 I've never read anything by this author, so I'm not sure if it's just the book, or the author that I took such a dislike to.  I'm the kind of person who once I open a book, I need to finish it.  Most of the time it takes me 1-2 days.  This one however took me over a week.  It was boring.  It had little to hold my interest.  The characters were blah, the plot even more so.    The other reviews told of the entire plot so I'm not going to go into that, but I will share my opinion of the characters.  Margaret's whishy washy "Should I, Shouldn't I" continued throughout the whole book and half way through it got very annoying.  Sir Richard was a little more interesting, but again it was the "Should I, Shouldnt I" kind of thing. That is not bad if the book has other redeeming qualities, but to me, it didn't.  There was no passion or intensity, and no chemistry between the two characters. A good book has you cheering for the hero/heroine and keeps you on the edge of you seat, just waiting till they finally get together.  But I was happier that I had actually finished the book, than I was when they finally got together.   I judge the worth of a book by how it draws me in and keeps me there and when reading became a chore, I knew it deserved only one star.  A few others liked the book, so I won't tell you not to read it, but to me, it was not worth the time.  Hope this helps a little!  
 The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing 
 Frankly, Sex Magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe.  Masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a Sigil.  Have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal.  Simple, no?  And, guess what?  That's all this book says, as practical information goes.  The rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 While the book is well written, it gives no knowledge to the real estate investment game. It seems more like a build up to get the readers interested in what they may succeed at, with his instructions. In other words, just another sell for his on going training. Save your money and watch the infomercial. It's about the same information and interviews.   
 As stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea, but it is so small it barely fits my [...]. It will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off. He gets very frustrated and so am I. If I have to re-velcro this thing again I am going to scream, and he only got it this morning for easter. I called fisher-price but they are closed for the holiday...I plan on calling again tomorrow and I WILL be getting some sort of refund....hey maybe I can score a free Field Journal. HAHA... Good Luck To You All. 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 Thus, with the quote from the film above, goes the movie Shark Attack 3.  All of the negative feedback about this film is true.  Rather than go on about what has been stated well already, though, here are what I believe are the most memorable lines that make this film uber cliched:  "You're extinct, F-er!"  "My lawyers will have a field day with you.  THEY are the real sharks."  "I'm really wired.  So why don't I take you home and eat your _____."  (after destroying the megalodon) "Mega-la-who?" (laughter) "Hey, where are the cocktails?"  This is the kind of dialogue you can expect from the film.  These are the highlights.  Of course, I am not pointing out all the excellent grunting and 'roaring" that the sharks expel, but I don't want to give everything away.  Well, one more thing: audiences find out that boats are commonplace within a prehistoric shark's diet.  Why would you, dear viewer, want to watch this 
 Devon is right -- emotions are human adaptations. But this is not a new discovery he came up with. Cosmides and Tooby founded an entire new field called evolutionary psychology, based on the idea that psychological adaptations are formed the way physical adaptations are. They've written many scholarly articles, and many books are available on the topic. Many popular books on this subject contain silly errors or a bit of the author's ego, but this one it out there. Way out there. Here's the thing -- this is a scientific field, but Devon is utterly unpracticed in it. His conclusions are logically based on his premises, but his premises are utterly unfounded. Just because his overarching premise is true -- emotions are adaptations -- doesn't mean all his little pet ideas have any basis in reality at all. What is the proof, for example, that human beings start over with a new partner for each child? In fact, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary. Most men do not want to couple with a woman with children from another man -- the idea that at 33 months a child no longer needs resources from two parents is simply laughable. To suggest they need no parents at all and the mother can simply go on with a new man and produce a new child is in the realm of the absurd. 
 Disappointed in the overall look and content of the book.  Would rate it a C+.  Helle 
 Many differences between Christianity and the religions that the author has studied are not mentioned in this book, and even further, some of the religious accounts that the author talks about are disputed.   For example, take the Krishna-Christ comparison. Here, the author fails to note that Krishna was never worshipped alone; in fact, his female counterpart Radha is often worshipped with, and even before him. This is a huge difference in relation to Chist's story. In addition to this, the Krishna story that is used, including possible cruxifiction, is not widely accepted. The more widely known version is that Krishna died when an arrow pierced his foot, similarly to the later Greek legend of Achilles.  This is just a small drop of a pool of other similar examples. In other words, read with reservation 
 I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars. It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected. PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover 
 This is without a doubt the worst reference on typography that I have ever read. It is filled with useless metaphors and examples. I really expected more from the Adobe Press 
 The book does a good jobs explaining the absolute basics.  It goes into extreme depth describing how to play solitaire and using pocket word, however, those users who want descriptions on more advanced topics such as configuring memory cards or solving connectivity problems with other devices such as palm and accessories will be disapointed 
 The author's views on Islam are probably accurate.  It is a religion that is diametrically opposed to the teachings of Scripture but his understanding of that becomes faulty when he tries to predict the outcome of things that God has expressly hidden.  Prophecy fever always diverts attention from the needs of the world.  I have not found a book that moves the church to reach out.  The solution offered by the author of these sorts of works typically urge you to go literally or figuratively out to a mountaintop to await Christ and in effect to ignore the world.   Follow this sort of advice and you will be "of the world" but not in it... you will out of fear flee the world as the world would flee any other danger.  Perfect love casts out fear and the glory of the church is not in seeing the future and protecting itself but in sacrificial service to advance the kingdom 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 This is the fourth book in the Wright Family Series. It begins with A.J. Cooper and Kane Wright's crew on an assignment to kill a terrorist. A.J. is the sharp shooter, but she freezes when the target is in her sights. Kane wants to get rid of her and send her back to the states.  A.J. is then kidnapped when they try to make their escape, so Kane has to rescue her. A situation arises that makes them stay in the desert and hunt the terriorist down.  The story is so unbelievable that I had to literally force myself to finish this book. It was awful, the worst so far in the series.  Even though they were on the move to find the man who A.J. couldn't shoot in the beginning of the story, they were in no way taking the situation seriously.  1. A.J. froze and couldn't shoot the man, but the other operatives wanted her input on what they should do to find him.  2. In a sand storm instead of being on guard of any shooters, they climb in the back of the vehicle and take their clothes off.  3. Riding on a camel, the only thing they had on their mind was how to get intimate while riding through the desert.  4. The ending was so lame, Kane turned into a wimp and A.J. had to save him.  If you really want to read this book, I know it is a part of the series, but get it from your library, believe me it is not worth the money.  Cherry Adair has taken a series that started off good, kept you wanting to hurry and read the next book, and then it has gotten really stale in the last couple of books.   
 The book's structure, arranged by knowledge group (e.g. quality and HR) rather than by phase is not helpful and is the first of many problems with this text. Probably the greatest flaw is not emphasizing the inputs, outputs, and tools and techniques of each phase, which is a big part of the PMP exam. The book also goes into excessive detail in certain areas (e.g. EVA calculation) and ignores other very important areas that are part of the exam.  There are much better alternatives to this prep book. 
 This book has very little to do with money a very much to do with sending money to the church. I bought a copy for each of my girls, 16 and 18 years old, each of them very spiritual, and they were both very turned off by the "preachy" context of the book. In fact, the 18-year-old told me she felt like she learned nothing about money, and as for the spiritual side, there are better books for that as well. She was especially turned off by one passage that recommended one way of making more money is giving more to the church 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one 
 This album sounds atrocious. The remastering job is a joke. I'm always amazed how record companies try to get you to buy the same album over and over again and in this case the CD. They use big words that sound good like "Digitally remastered"+"24 bit mixing" etc. The first cut of this horrible sounding rerelease had an usually amount of background hiss. Same was true of the second song. Hiss has never bothered me historically but in this case it did. What tapes were they using I wonder? The guitar sounds brittle and overall it was hard for me to judge the music since this CD sounded so awful. However, the bonus live tracks sound great and are packed full of dynamite. I have heard tracks from this album on vinyl and they sounded much better.    
 For those of you put off by the negativity of most of the Amazon reviews of this book, let me suggest one concrete reason why this book is not worth your time. The story of the 2004 Red Sox was a story of great players. Certainly, Theo Epstein deserves much credit, but it was David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez and Keith Foulke and Bill Mueller and...on an on, and most definately Pedro Martinez. A tip off to the problem with the book is to look up Ramirez, Manny in the index. The dearth of references told me immediately that Shaughnessy had not gotten past his personal animosities. On the subject of Pedro, he is pathetic. There are no good stories like one would expect from an "insider account." Yet again we hear how huge the Varitek-Arod fight was. Yet again, he spews about Nomar. A few quotes here and there but mostly a glossy distant portrait by a writer who sounds deeply unhappy. If you followed the season as a fan, you won't learn anything you didn't already know. Stick with the videos until a better book comes alon

 This magazine should be free, since there are so many advertisements.  Also, it is strictly modern decorating, unlike the editor's claims.  If you like extreme, modern style, try it out; otherwise invest in something else 
 I expected this book to be fun take on the Hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the "other side" and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms.  Nope.  Susanne Hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers (and her nanny friends' employers) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule.  It would have been much, MUCH better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements.  In every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires.  She seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set.  There was no joy in reading this book once I realized that while she may have changed the children's names, the names of the parents were quite real.  It puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar 
 I purchased two of these, one for each of my sons. I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. Got it charging, we think. Then we start on the second one. We take it out and the charger is half melted. Ok, not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. Well, when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened, rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged, we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour, with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. And the light didn't work. While trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. We can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. When we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy, much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart, and I paid close to the same amount. They were difficult to get out of the packaging, because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart, but that should have been good, to protect during shipping. However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. I will admit that I haven't tried to return them. I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. I am tempted though, because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. I am VERY upset. So now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain. 
 Don't buy this disc unless you are a real Jackie Lovell fan. The best thing in this DVD is Lovell's dance at the end 
 cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.  
 Overall, I did enjoy reading this book.  I'm not sure though that I would recommend it to a friend.  I didn't feel a deep connection with any of the characters for the most part.  I was intrigued to see what would end up happening, so I found it to be a page-turner.  There was a lot of botany involved in which plants were referred to by their genus-species name.  I don't feel that was a necessity to the main plot.  
 After giving this album repeated listenings, I'll echo the complaints many have made: there simply aren't enough memorable melodies here and I'd say the lyrics are a bit dodgy as well most of the time. ("You are not my typewriter/But you could be my demon..") The band masks these deficiencies with electronic squawks, blipping synth, toy pianos and cascading white noise that make for a gorgeous soundscape while you're listening. The problem is when the little aluminum disc stops spinning: the songs don't keep replaying in my head as they're supposed to. Sometimes the band has a good melody going but belabors it into dust. (See 7 minute + epic "Reservations")  HIGHLIGHTS: The band's moment with the littlest pretense is easily the best. "Heavy Metal Drummer" wistfully recalls starting out in music. ("I miss the innocence I've known/playing KISS covers/beautiful and stoned") It's probably also blessed with the catchiest melody here and the electronics ladled onto it COMPLEMENT the song rather than compete with it. Outside of that one, lowkey "Jesus, Etc." is a country-tinged charmer that again features one of the better melodies here. Superfluous instrumentation and effects are missing here but they're not MISSED: The song doesn't need them. "I'm the Man that Loves You" employs a bit of jaggedness musically in the form of a willfully cacophonous, feedbacked guitar but it's there to spice up the song. Without it, Wilco would still have a solid effort.   LOWS: It's hard to single out the valleys here, not because the songs are pretty decent but because the flaw with most of them is the same: I just can't recall the melody as soon as the song ends. I'd probably say the worst offender here is "War on War". "Poor Places" is another that never really seems to grab onto me at all.   BOTTOM LINE: In the end, I see this as Wilco's counterpart to R.E.M.'s REVEAL: an album with weak tunes gussied up with fussy and avant-garde sonics to make them sound larger than life. It DOES grow on you a bit with repeat plays but not so much that I think it'll ever become a favourite Wilco release and certainly not one of my "Desert Island" albums. Enough Wilco fans are deriding this that I'd say that it's not even safe to say "Diehard fans only". Best to hear this one before plunking down your duckets...  2 1/2 star 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Two-and-a-half stars.  In Requiem, Faulkner pens a sequel to his sensational novel Sanctuary, attempting to navigate the troubled marriage of Gowan and Temple Stevens. He delves deep into Temple's psyche, revealing a woman unable (or unwilling) to escape her troubled, violent past in Memphis. Just as her marriage is spiralling to destruction, Gowan and Temple's daughter dies at the hands of their nurse, Nancy. Faulkner seems to be trying to lend some serious philosophical weight to the otherwise lightweight Sanctuary. Two problems. First, Sanctuary was fine as it was; a sequel was unnecessary. Second, the narrative structure of Requiem--half prose, half play--while initially intriguing, ultimately hinders Faulkner is his attempt to probe psychological depths. (There's only so much of that you can do when you're limited to dialogue.) Oh, and of course that annoying ubiquitous allknowing lawyer Gavin Stevens has to put his $.02 in. I recommend this book only for true Faulkner lovers 
 Pros: it's pretty  Cons: it's garbage  Sure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage!  So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)  I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.  Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere.  If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy.. 
 I read the statement: Will send in two to three business days. It's been almost one month. I never received the video.  I'm not happy 
 Like so many Hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s, when America's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine.  See The Shawshank Redemption, see Dead Poet's Society, see With Honors -- filmdom's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades.  Naturally, this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend.  In regular Hollywood fashion, Nurse Ratched (the chief antagonist) and the cuckoos' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is, of course.  Unlike most fare of this sort, it is at least very competently crafted (the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all), which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise.  -- M. Cooper 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 This book is not a great choice. Weak plot, includes a no-interest romance and basically just stop in the middle.  Only if you have nothing else to read imho 
 My main gripe with this book is that there is not 1 picture.  It makes it really hard to figure out what you are even making 
 I agree with most reviewers.  This coffee maker is a piece of junk.  The few cups that I made were the worst tasting coffee ever 
 I hope Cornwell gets professional help for whatever motivated him to author this.   Rychlak's book "Hitler, the War, and the Pope" needs to be read if you choose to read this one.   Law professor historian Ron Rychlak(nonCatholic) has shown proof author Cornwell was biased and telling lies, starting from the front cover of "Hitler's Pope".   That cover picture story is interesting and demonstrative of Cornwell's penchant for manipulative tactics to get the result he wanted. The building in the cover photo is the office of both the Weimar government and later Hitler. Go to the UK Amazon site and notice that the cover photo for the same book is different than the cover on the American Amazon site. They both naturally were the same(they both were the UK cover) when the book was originally published, but the surprise phone call by Rychlak to an American radio show Cornwell was on, not only forced Cornwell to then alter the photo, but change the inset text that described the photo. But Cornwell still apparently couldn't help himself, he still was manipulative, so instead of eliminating the photo he carefully eliminated the parts of the photo and blurred the other parts that proved it was not a visit to Hitler, but to the Weimar government - Hitler's rivals before he took power. Wow, what a disturbed jerk.  Cornwell was further forced to reprint the book in the US and change the text inside the book falsely claiming that the picture was taken after Hitler gained power.  Some of Cornwell's misrepresentations and falsifications were exposed after Rychlak published his analysis of Cornwell's facts, so I suggest reading what Rychlak has published on the web in addition to reading Rychlak's book. 
 I have glorious white hair, and I thought this would be good for it.  But it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly I don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of Suave that's out there. I've also used Lush's BIG shampoo and Soak 'n' Float shampoo bars, and I like them much better. 
 I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.   
 I would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the (short) history and theory of video art. As such, I will say this book is a very basic, sort of bland overview of the langauge of video. It's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and "hip"; all the stills are well printed and all the big, "in-vogue" art star names are included (but where are people like Haron Faroqi? Or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut?) With that said, there is little to no actual critical content in the writing. It introduces concepts in a very simple way, and doesn't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization. I don't know maybe I am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic, but I actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring. If you're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends, one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called "connoisseurship of video art" and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at "all the pretty pictures" (which I find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video), then this book is for you. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, I would look elsewhere to titles like "Illuminating Video : An Essential Guide to Video Art" by David Ross, Doug Hall, Sally Jo Fifer, and David Bolt. 
 I loved "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country".  They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia.  I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation.  I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless.  I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited.  It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain.  I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England.  In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon.  If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself.  I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable 
 You can play this game with a regular deck of cards.  I have heard it called "Oh Hell", "Oh Heck", and "Up and Down the River", but its all the same thing.  You start by dealing one card to everyone.  You go around the circle and bid either 1 or 0 (since there is only one trick).  You play the trick like any other trick-based game, but you don't have to play to win the trick.  The only restriction is that you must follow suit.  If you get your bid (and 0 is a valid bid), you get 10 points + 1 point for each trick that you won.  If you don't get your bid, you get 1 point for every trick as well.    You deal 2 cards for the second round, 3 for the third, etc. until you deal out all the cards or as many as possible for the number of people you are playing with.  You can introduce trump by flipping the top card of the remaining deck over once you deal.  Why pay ten bucks for this deck when it's just a regular deck with different rules in the box 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 This looks to be an excellent book, but I strongly recomend you buy it somewhere other than Amazon  (unless you have 4-6 weeks to wait) I ordered it as a gift more than a month ago and have yet to get it.  The other book I ordered with it finally arrived sans the gift wrapping I opted for.  Well, at least IT came 
 Masson, who has the virtue of at least being honest in his views, has been refuted so many time by so many scholars from different circles, that I find it strange that some still think his thesis revolutionary. Ignorance  of relevant literature certainly makes one vulnerable to Masson's own  assault on truth.  For a brief yet exhaustive account of the history Masson  mentions the reader may consult G. Izenberg's essay in The Combridge  Companion to Freud. Another helpful book--which exposed Masson so much that  he sued its author, and lost--is In the Freud Archives by Janet Malcom 
 I bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  I didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  As soon as it was turned on I had the following problems:  1) Five seconds after I turn it on, it always says "USB Connected!"-- and I don't have a USB cable inserted into it!  This also freezes the device.  I found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted.  2) I cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  My computer does recognize the USB device, but when I try to copy files over to the frame, I get a "path is not found" error.  3) I thought I could live with the above 2 problems if it could JUST SHOW MY PICTURES.  So I used a card reader to load .JPG files onto a CF card at 400x300 resolution. When, I plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as "Invalid" when I try to view them.  Emailed Coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying:   "Coby Tech Support to me 5:25 am (3 hours ago)   Hello,  We have received your inquiry. It appears that your unit is defective. Return the unit to the retailer for an exchange."  What an inconvenience and disappointment.  I will be buying a different product 
 I was dissappointed with this product. It had freyed and untied hammock strings when I got it out of the box. As pricey as it originally was I expected at least a swing that was manufactured well. But this is terrible. It looked like it wasn't even completely assembled 
 I have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the Senseo Coffeemaker.  Folding filter paper didn't work....too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee....The Quick-Cup sounded like a good idea....but it doesn't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee.  I found that the Eco-Pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well.  The key to any of these re-usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter.  The pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee. The Quick-Cup and the Eco-Pad are essentially the same design but the Eco-Pad fits the holder correctly and the Quick-Cup is slightly small.  Buy the Eco-Pad, it works.  The Quick-Cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the Quick-Cup and the holder...a gasket, to prevent the water from going around.   Good Luck 
 Junk, junk, junk.   Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service.  Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever.  This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website.  We purchased Cuisinart, works great 
 Title is very mis-leading..grants only apply if you live in certain states. If you need money why would you spend money for a book that does apply to you...waste of money. 
 I'm not sure I quite understand the 5 star reviews here. My sister-in-law raved about this and, after reading the reviews here, I picked it for our book club. I read this in two days and I'm not sure just what we'll discuss when we meet. I found the writing to be totally juvenile, about on par with a teen novel. No depth of character anywhere - not one character was developed enough to make me care. The idea that the doctor and sheriff would continue to be best friends with, and socialize with, the judge and his wife, who are so totally without moral compass is ludicrous. Exactly what was it they were afraid of?? The story was predictable to the end, and disappointingly so at that. There - discussion done. 
 Whoever was responsible for proofreading this book should be sentenced to house arrest. It's hard to believe this defective product was released by the Oxford Press. The frequent grammar and spelling mistakes naturally lead the reader to question whether the facts of the story have been thrown together with the same careless abandon. As far as the story goes, you already know it. Profits, Politics, Power, and Greed combined to facilitate the proliferation of nuclear technology, especially centrifuge technology and chinese bomb design, to Iran, Libya, North Korea, and, of course, Pakistan. No need to spend your money on this book. The Publisher certainly has not earned your business with the release of this shoddy, unprofessional work. 
 I won't go into the plot synopsis here, since it's been pretty well outlined by the other reviews. But all I have to say is that this book is fueled by nothing but lust.  I want love in the books I read. Romance in my romance novel, not porn. I've enjoyed books by Sabrina Jeffries in the past (THE FORBIDDEN LORD, AFTER THE ABDUCTION), but NEVER SEDUCE A SCOUNDREL was disgusting. When the characters are giving each other orgasms through petting at page 100, something's wrong. I mean, these two people didn't even know each other, each distrusts the other (for good reasons), and yet they have their hands in each other's clothes and are playing sex games (the pirate and the captive) on the second day that they know each other? How sick is this?  I'm not a prude, but this was just too much. How many people in modern times behave like this, let alone English girls in 1818? I hardly think a virgin on the marriage mart would have jumped the bones of a man she barely knew like this. Not realistic. And even if it were, I don't want to read about it! Physical attraction should be an added bonus to growing feelings of love and affection, not the sole reason a couple is together. I want to read about people falling in love with a person, not just that person's body. As if sex alone is enough to sustain a meaningful relationship.  This is the second time I haven't finished a novel by Sabrina Jeffries because it was so overloaded with sex and devoid of romance. The first time was with ONE NIGHT WITH A PRINCE. Now NEVER SEDUCE A SCOUNDREL had let me down. I'll give her one more try to redeem herself, but I'm about ready to give up on Sabrina Jeffries' work 
 I found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about 20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content. The photography & art direction were exquisite 
 This book contains an interesting selection of photos of German and American prisoners, then and now; also a map of the United States showing hundreds of places prisoners were held.  Some interesting facts emerge such  as German prisoners held in Mississippi camps working in swamps and cotton  fields, suffering malnutrition,and in the words of one ex prisoner, being  "treated no better than the blacks we were working with.&quot 
           Barnsley's book has a shortcoming common to many math text books -- it's poorly written.  Barnsely's writing style is superfluous and rambling.  What I learned from this book was in spite of Barnsley's writing, not because of it.         Furthermore, the book's illustrations are substandard.  There are over five different fonts used in illustrations (including hand written text).  This leads to confusion when you're unsure if the text in Barnsley's illustrations is referring to Greek letters or the conventional alphabet.  Another shortcoming is that Barnsley intermingles end of chapter exercises with new concepts.  You may have problems 1.1 to 1.5 reviewing what you've already learned, and then problem 1.6 introduces completely new material.  This is a problem throughout the book, as important concepts are introduced in exercises or otherwise illogical locations.       On the positive side, solutions to most exercises are presented at the end of the book.  Overall the book was useful, but learning the material was unnecessarily difficult due to the book's shortcomings. 
 I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author 
 I purchased the above product in 2006.  I opened the package and used them in 2007.  After they were washed twice I found that it was virtually impossible to get them to fit on the bed.  They shrunk so much!  I have regular king size pillows and cannot even get the cases on the pillow.  I tried to return these, but was told that I purchase them too long ago, and I could only get 50% back and I would have to pay for the shipping.  I think the company should stand behind this product.  I have much less expensive sheet sets and this did not happen to them.  DO NOT BUY, NO WORTH THE MONEY 
 In a nutshell: If you own a Mac, do NOT buy this machine. I struggled with Brother's tech support system several times to make it work with my iBook running OS 10.4, and still have not been able to scan a thing. I've also begun having problems sending faxes, as the machine eats the documents. Last time I had to send an important document, I went to an Office Depot and paid to send it for fear of it being eaten by this machine. Buyer beware--especially Mac users 
 I have this book and it's not worthy, well, maybe to have a hard copy of the API with some good comments, because that's what it is... maybe the code examples will help you some times, but I expected a lot more of a book about Carbon.. 
 I plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver.  The receiver light kept blinking which means that it didn't recognize the controller. After several tries I decided that the product is defective and returned it 
 One word to summarize the whole production: pathetic. The script, the action, the actors are laughable. On top of that it is historically incorrect, just like other movies recently. The duels and fighting scenes are ridiculous. Surprised by Angus Macfadyen taking part in this clown show (he must be broke).  Do yourself a favor and skip it 
 I liked very much Trout and Ries, Positioning and Marketing Warfare. Reading this book, I had an impression that most of the professional knowledge the author has, was distilled in his previous books.  Mr Trout is doing something he said was not a good practice in Advertising (see Positioning): Line Extension. The good parts of this book you will find in his previous books, maybe with different phrases and examples.   The other thing that is hurting is that he is trying to give advice in areas where he has limited knowledge and experience.   Looking at some titles of the chapters in this book you will find:  Chapter 4 - Quality and Customer Orientation are rarely differentiating Ideas.  Toyota and Honda achieved a position in the mind of customers worldwide that they make high quality products for a good price. Well, it will be difficult for the other automakers, who are actually working to catch up in quality, to differentiate themselves on quality, for they are also runs. I would say that is a hell of a strategy, maybe is not for everyone, but them differentiation is by definition for a few, and not for everybody.  How many companies have positioned themselves as high quality products? Does it pay? Go ask Nikon, Zeiss, Leica, Volvo, Patek Philippe...  Chapter 5 has as title: "Creativity is not a differentiating Idea"  I guess I cannot believe that Mr. Trout has read his own phrase. Does he mean that lack of creativity is a differentiating Idea? Does not make sense. I think quite the opposite, when you are not able to create something unique, is when you go out trying to do something else to differentiate yourself.    I have seen creativity applied to Advertising, the results were fantastic. In Brazil, sometime ago, Brastemp, (a Home Appliances company with financial links with Whirlpool) run an ad campaign that stressed the Quality of Brastemp products using the phrase: " it is not a Brastemp !". Each ad told a story about something (not related to appliances) and the concluding remarks would be " it is not a Brastemp !". The phrase got so popular, that became incorporated as an expression of our language. The end result was that Brastemp established itself in the market so strongly that still today people in Brazil position Brastemp as the top quality producer of home appliances. In the mind of the Brazilian consumer Brastemp is top quality, better than GE, Electrolux, ex-Westinghouse, etc...  I have seen creativity applied to Product Design with similar results.   This book should be read with a critical eye, for it has some impressive phrases but when you think a second time and compare with some practical experience you find problems.   I am not an advertising professional, I just enjoy reading books that come with good new ideas.     
 This book was obviously written with the intent of deifying a minor movement that had virtually no impact on US foreign policy towards South Africa.  The 'evidence' that was provided to justify some of these claims seem to come out of nowhere (as they likely must have).  If you want to add another book to your collection which has completely recreated history with regards to South Africa, buy this book!  If you want an enlightened account of US Economic Policies with regards to South Africa, keep searching 
 Not just simple ideas in this one but stupid ones too.  No one should ever read this colossal waste of time unless by reading you mean beating yourself unmercifully on the face and head until death occurs 
 Fooled again by the word "activities" in the title.  Why do so many authors think that a worksheet qualifies as an activity?  It is so frustrating and boring for the students 
 After reading a couple of very good reviews about this movie I was anticipating the release of this giallo from Mondo Macabro. While the DVD presentation ( like the rest of MM's releases) of the film is great, the film itself left much to be desired.  Being a fan of many a gialli I was prepared, and wanted, to enjoy this film - even when the story shifted from the two "main" characters (one of which was the killer) and into a far less interesting story involving two insipid, joyriding beach lovers, I was still willing to go along for the ride.  However, after over an hour of boredom I kept telling myself to wait because "The Killer Must Kill Again."  Thus the title became a kind of mantra for me - something to help me see the film through to its disappointing conclusion.  With a giallo film I'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief, engage myself in ludicrous plots and watch cardboard characters go through the motions, all for the sake of the bravura cinematic style and meticulous, inventive (and sometimes brutal) murder sequences which are a staple of the genre.  While "The Killer Must Kill Again" has a few nice stylistic touches, it was not nearly enough to make up for the film's many, many short comings - and as for the murder sequences (there are two) they are completely devoid of imagination and entirely forgettable.  It might be Luigi Cozzi's best film, but then again, that's not really enough to recommend it.  
 This is a cheap plastic (except for the metal tube)toy. It's like those hand claws for kids. You squeeze the handle and the claw closes. The grabber part on this thing has a 2 1/2" opening. You won't be able to grab a small can of soup. The magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger. On the inside of the fingers, they have rubber pads that are removable (probably for cleaning) but they seem to come off on their own 
 This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, "The culture of education" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. "Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection." What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as "immutable," Pontogenetically," and "Hermeneutic." If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell 
 SPC is a process that derived from the mid-20/30's. It was used to help bring fledgling industrial factories back into alignment with their output. It is also a simplistic form of math, otherwise know as statistics, used to develop control charts or metrics. I found this book to be dull, out-of-date (hello, we are in the 2000's) and extremely overpriced. It does not even pertain to most business practices these days that utilize much better, current models of capability measurements 
 If I could I would give this book no stars. I did not find anything in this book at all helpful. I bought this when I first got married in hopes that would give me some sort of insight into marriage and my husband. Now 4 years down the line, I learned this book is nothing but rubbish. Foremost I did not care for the author Kevin Leman. He seems like just your typical egotistical male writing a book with the thoughts that all women are fragile little butterflies in a cocoon and all men are barbaric sex maniacs. I am not in anyway a feminist, but unfortunately in alot of marriages the stereotypical "You Jane, Me Tarzan" does not fit. In my case, this was so, which is why this book was of little use to me. I will give it a little credit. In a way, it made me realise how lucky I was that my husband came no where near the way this guy was describing men! Maybe it is a good book for those in "typical" relationships. But, not a good book if you or your significant other falls out of the lines of the "typical" male and female behavior 
 This guy is a convicted felon and crook.  Note: all positive reviews only have one review in the history.   
 There's an old adage amongst some of us online reviewers that kinda/sorta goes like this: if you have to resort to frequently using words like "perfect," "riveting," "startling," and "stunning," you're more than likely describing what the story isn't for the average person because the average person -- the casual reader, Joe Six Pack with a good in his hands -- tends to find these adjectives descriptive of very specific events in his life ... events like falling in love, throwing the game-winning touchdown pass, and having a child.  As a consequence of such overblown rhetoric, James Sallis' DRIVE ends up being memorable only on the grounds that one was duped into believing such a middleground neo-noir tale is destined to be literature's next classic when it'll probably be nothing in the next ten years.  Yes, it's "lean," and it could quite probably be read in a single sitting if not in a handful of hours, and, yes, it's full of the pretty-sounding, poetic prose any reader of Sallis has come to expect, but there's little meat on these bloodied bones: Driver sticks to what he does well -- he drives, be it for movie studios or as the getaway driver for a handful of hardened criminals -- but, once he's double-crossed, you find out he's a wealth of other talents in extracting revenge on those who set him up.  The grim reality here is that no one REALLY sets Driver up; he simply takes the wrong job at the wrong time, and, as generally happens in noir tales, there's a price to be paid.  Driver isn't fond of paying such a price, so he hits back at those he try to take him for a ... well ... er ... for a ride.  Unfortunately, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative extremely difficult to follow, as Sallis attempts to successfully unfold this yarn out of chronology -- think of it as sort of an even hipper, jet set, PULP FICTION type narrative where some events are even told twice ... with the same exact words and from the same point of view.  It's a gamble -- a highly calculated gamble -- and I didn't feel it came off very well here.  As a matter of fact, it forced me to flip back to the earlier section in the book to make certain I wasn't somehow lost in this 160-page novel.  Yes, DRIVE is certainly a noir tale, but it's hardly 'hard-boiled,' as Ohio's ThisWeek tries to make its readers believe.  It's been my experience that critics who don't dabble in 'hard-boiled' literature usually do this -- attach the adjective to what they believe is 'hard-boiled' in order to sound relevant -- and this tends to produce a flattening effect: less people question the validity of the description and, instead, pick up the book and read.  I give credit to Sallis to creating a inventive modern day noir, but, at this cynical, I give his salivating critics credit for selling more copies than was humanly necessary 
 Had I realized that this book was less about business and more about this man's faith I would not have bothered.  He seems to need constant reassurance that G_D is OK with us making money.  The theme becomes redundant and not terribly helpful.  I doubt that he will ever becoe a billionaire, but please let me know if he does 
 In studying this time period, my three children and I have read MANY books.  I found this book to be somewhat boring in comparison to several of the books we've read so far.  I felt that from what we have learned about this time period, this story was not realistic, and perhaps a little "whitewashed".  The situations and humor seemed contrived, and the plot was simplistic.  And I did think that it was preachy.  We do have strong values, but we have read several books that have incorporated these values believably into realistic and exciting plots. This book was disappointing 
  Before anyone gets the wrong idea about this review,I'd like to say that One Way is a fabulous group.I think they are waaaaay underated.MCA/Universal or whoever put this garbage of a compilation together should be ashamed of themselves.One Way is in DIRE need of a worthwhile collection,and this one misses the mark big time.My guess is the industry has been overlooking One Way because their records have not been placing high on the charts or selling "Thriller" type numbers.What about us One Way fans that religiously bought those records? In short,where is "Love Is","Guess You Didn't Know","Lost Inside Of You" & "Toast To The Other Man"?  To wrap things up  One Way on a scale of 1 to 5:10 This Compliation on a scale of 1 to 5: 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 Wasn't perticularly thrilled. Was expecting more classical tap dancing. I wish the product details had specified that it was more 'New age'. At least I would have known what to expect 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie 
 Robinson needs a new technical editor.  He has SEALs stumbling around in the dark without night vision devices, A-4 Skyhawks with 2 engines, a SEAL team that turns into a SAS team after 40 pages, SEALs carrying the tripod for a M60 on a long mission, a long time SEAL with no parachute experience, and a poorly thought out campaign by the British to retake the Falkland islands (apparently the British do not have any stand off weapons such as cruise missles).  I gave up on Robinson while reading Scimitar because he had Iranians speaking Arab to each other.  As most people know, Iranians speak Farsi because Iranians are not Arabs, they are Persians - the original Aryans.  I gave this book a try because the jacket made it interesting but I will not be reading any more of his work 
 Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered. 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 This is a horrible example of sophmoric "witty" commentary paired with the idiocy of stat-based evaluation. If irrelevant asides were not enough, they are mostly wrong as regards players from the team I follow closely, the Oakland A's. Take the notes on Houston Street ("never will be in the Lidge/Rivera class"), Zito ("overrated"), minor leaguer Travis Buck (stupid comments on his name, totally inappropriate), Ander Ethier (overmatached in the big leagues). Where their prognastications are reasonable, a simple extrapolation from previous years (anyone could do it in their head) would suffice, not some pseudo sophisticated computer program. I hate this book 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This film is a mockery of the aviation field. A very small percentage of the phraseology is correct, even the plot itself is severely flawed. First off, being an air traffic controller, I know first hand that you can't go and work at some facility you haven't worked at for a while, until you get evaluated to make sure you can work safely. Second of all, you can't move from your position(sector if you will) and start working at another while leaving the previous position unmonitored. If you are using this movie to learn about air traffic, then please do not apply for a job. The movies will not teach you about the job. It takes anywhere between 2-4 years to get rated at an ATC center. You can't just come in and take a position. When a movie comes out that is realistic to air traffic, I will put my stamp of approval on it 
 The book poses a very good question, one that most people are thinking about - "What will the future of work be in an outsourced global environment? "  But sadly Malone never risks making any futuristic predictions. This book captures the history of functional organizations and a some recent radical organizational models.    Internal trading concept for sharing scarce resources within an organization was rather interesting. In the final chapters Malone goes in-depth about the consulting industry's model of resource deployment, but he seemed to have missed out the key role that Resource Deployment Managers play in serving customers. As an earlier reviewer mentioned the concepts are over simplified and repetitive. It was an interesting read for me until I finished 2/3rd of the book, when I started to slowly discover that the book was repeating concepts and the author is reluctant to be making bold predictions as the title suggested. If you just want an interesting presentation on different organization models currently in practice then this book may be for you but if you are looking beyond the present then you will be disappointed.         
 Milton deserves better than this.  Orgel and Goldberg boast that they have produced a radical Milton, but all they really offer is rehashed Alastair Fowler, without Fowler's erudition or eloquence.  Many of the notes are  just plain ignorant.  There are better editions out there 
 obviously, the music featured here is of high-quality.  hardly sign of the times transcendent, but nonetheless very exciting (as was typical of prince's 2002 tour).  unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound, hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some horribly cheesy effects and cuts.  for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity, it's a shame the director clearly hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber.  hey prince, just so you know....your DIY "NPGMC" approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you.  if it looks this amateurish then you just look, well...amateurish.  and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation.  the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this.   i mean really, you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par: i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this.    hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this, but casual fans (especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert) should definitely avoid.  
 Marry anne's dad and Dawn's mom get married.  This is a good book to read but would you really be that happy to have to move into a house with your best friend?  And I know I would not want my dad to marry my best friend's  mom especially if she had been divorced before.  But overall it is a good  book that goes pretty quickly 
 I adore Ishiguro.  I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day.  Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous.  I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled.  I confess, I read to enjoy myself.  I have a degree in English literature.  I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all 
 This phrasebook has lots of useful grammatical information.  However, many of the examples are literal translations of the English.  The results are phrases that are not good or natural Amharic.  Instead, they teach you how to sound like a foreigner.  Though there is an Ethiopian listed as one of the authors, it is clear that he felt pressured to produce a prodcut that was close to the English 
 Basically what you are asked to do in this book is generate dozens of lists on your own and that this process will somehow create an epiphany of your ideal career.  In the beginning, I forced myself to be open-minded about this process, but found that writing interminable lists, which did nothing to clarify what was already floating in my head, did not lead to a career decision. I suppose that this process is supposed to spark ideas and new insights - it didn't. All the stuff that I wrote down was information I already knew quite intuitively and seemed obvious (e.g., I want a job where I get along with co-workers). What I needed was something structured and concrete that would point me to certain careers, which this book really doesn't do.  
 Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 This novel seemed like a rush job. The characters are so prolific that you barely get to know who's who - is it human, animal or hunting history being shared. Too much to sort out and too little meat to make it worth it 
 I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes. Maybe it was groundbreaking once, but I doubt it. Maybe you should watch it while stoned. He probably wrote it that way.  
 There are many good things to say about Mr. McWhorter's book. Manty other reviewers have done that.  I want to add a warning.  Mr. McWhorter's book is about the theory of language dynamics.  It is not about any particular language, culture, people, place, or time.  Mr. McWhorter explains the processes that cause languages to change over time.  He does a remarkably good job of this.  However, he makes references to actual languages and actual statements only as they serve to illustrate changes over time.  If you are looking for some understanding of some particular language at some particular time, you will sadly agree with me that this book constantly changes the topic.  If there is a sustained discussion of one language for more than ten pages, then I cannot find it.  I must admit that I could not finish the book, after several tries.  The subtitle should be removed from the book.  This book is not a history of languages.  It is an excellent exposition for the general reader of the dynamic forces behind language change.  However, it contains nothing about any particular language 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 I bought this book because it was reviewed well.  I have no idea who liked it, or whom it is for.  It's definitely not an investor's book, despite the title.  It's more of a theoretical diatribe by the authors against Graham and Dodd -- read that instead.  It claims to be the updated version.  The preface mentions Enron, but everything else is from the 60s and 70s.  Examples talk about oil at $5 per barrel.  Overall, it's a disappointment, with very little that's useful or interesting 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 I have read every book about the Laci Peterson story, and this by far is the worst publication I have witnessed.  This book not only avoids the mass response by the public and media but devoices it of its presence.  It has also unjustified the heartbreak and torture Laci Peterson's family has had to endure.  
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
 The games faults have been well covered already so I'll just say, if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV. Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level. It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably. 
 this item arrived with a broken tank, and 1 week later quit making mist at al 
 I received my book a few days ago. I must say I was kind of disappointed. To pay $23.95 + shipping for a small paperback book with mostly black and white pictures. I think the book will be a good read and provide me with some good tips, but I think most of the pictures should have at least been in color to really get the ideas across and easy to see. I guess I thought that even though it was a paperback that it would be a larger book with better pictures. 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 I used this text in an elective on electrical machines and found the book very difficult to learn from.  Readability is not bad.  The writing is fine and easy enough to follow but the equations in the text were frequently the wrong equation for the topic.  Several tables had eroneous information.  While most text books contain some errata, this book contained more than any of the dozens of engineering books in my personal library.  None of the end of chapter problems had any answers in order to check work.  While only a nuisance, example problems in the text would reference a machine from several chapters back, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to understand the situation of the current example.  I did appreciate the fact that the book includes matlab examples and exercises as to aid understanding with simulations 
 The book is wearisome dreck.  First, what is it with Ishiguro and the "first-person-plus-flashback" narrative form?  I'm familiar with Artist of the Floating World, Remains of the Day, and now this; I haven't looked at anything else Ishiguro has written, but my guess is they all follow the same structure.  First person narratives that are mostly flashbacks.  Second, the characters don't evoke much pity, sympathy, or identification.  They are all sheep!  They grow up knowing what a lousy thing is going to be done to them, and yet they just wait around for it to happen.  It's not as if they are living in some sort of police state.  What prevents them from just leaving the situation?  You want to shake them awake.  Third -- and this relates to their sheeplike nature, I suppose -- very little actually happens in this book.  It's mostly talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  Character studies, I suppose, but listless and uninteresting characters.  Oh, one gets a certain perverse pleasure in reading about the manipulative [...] Ruth, but at the same time, and for the same reasons, one is left wondering why any of the other characters even talk to her, let alone befriend her.  I really don't see what all the fuss is about.  This book bored me to tears 
 I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material.   Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"  But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze 
 These lights don't hold a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said that these are "summer/spring" lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work.  The ad on Amazon did not say that.  I even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge (1 - 2 hours).  They are also very dim lights.  Don't waste your money 
 I think the Annie Dillard name is the sole reason for this "book" being published.  I write the word "book" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch.  To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two.  I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth.  Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme?  And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way.  I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess.  
 I got to the tip of Alaska, and none of the four batteries worked  no power!  I missed getting a day of once in a life time pictures.  David Highe 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 We don't all live by farmer's markets or in big cities. Too many ingredients (some hard to find in many places) and too long preparation time for stressed out families. I'm sorry Jamie, but I don't have time when I come home from work to crack open a coconut and shred it for fixing a sallad which, by the way, my family won't like. The amount of fat, especially saturated fat in the recipes is astounding. Fine for once a week, but for everyday?  I was very disappointed in this cookbook, I'm sorry to say 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 Unimpressive.  I bought this to help with overclocking an Asus P5B Deluxe motherboard (launched mid 2006) and it didn't even mention most of the BIOS options I wanted to know about.  The book advertises that it gives you 3 months access to the online Bios guide that is supposedly updated, but when I went online to activate that, it said the "promotion had expired".  It's a dictionary of bios terms, not a guide.  And the items covered are more pertinent to motherboards of 2004, not those made in 2007.  One could use google or wikipedia and get the same or better explanations as those in this book 
 A very broad list of questions with high level answers. I wouldn't buy this book if I were looking for a deep framework to handle this topic 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?  To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.  But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.  But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.   After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.  To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 If you are used to watching BTB of the BBC 1998 series you will be extremely disappointed. Bob and his gang's voice have changed & so is their favorite line to 'can we dig it'. There should be options for English,American English & others 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 I bought the 2006 edition of this book automatically, as I have for a number of years.  I am extremely disappointed with the totally revised content, as I find it much more difficult to use.  While it would seem logical to group the records together as done in the new volume, it just doesn't work for me.  The old layout of team info, with each team starting at the top of a page, has been junked, and the results are not pretty.  Furthermore, this is now just a record book; the old "facts" sections, including a review of the preceding season and a preview of the new season, have disappeared.  I'm keeping my 2005 edition and trashing the 2006.  I hope Sporting News comes to their senses and arranges the 2007 edition like the 2005 and prior editions.  "It wasn't broke, but they 'fixed' it anyway. 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 This is just a warning to anyone who may actually be thinking about buying this album.  KRS ONE is not a Christian, He did this CD to dupe actual Christians into listening to what his beliefs are.  If you didn't catch it, on the cover of the CD it says Temple of Hip Hop.. and not Temple of God, Hip Hop is a registered religion in which he is a Father/Co-Founder of along with Afrika Bambatta.  They are leaders of the Black Muslims also known as the  5% Nation.  This "Nation" actually believes that the Black man is God and the White man is the Devil.  So before anyone starts givin props to this man for Gods work, you should find out exactly which or what God he is working for.  You're either for Jesus or against him.. I haven't listened to this album completely, but I garauntee that he doesn't Mention the name of Jesus once, in fact in the first track after the intro all he does is brag and boast about how tight KRS One is.. and if he was a Christian then he would be humble.. but Like I said, he's not.. he's a 5% trying to fool the Christian community.  And Christians are Christ Followers because Christ is Lord and Savior... I hope this Review was helpful to somebod 
 Wow, a whole book of red sox fans talking about being red sox fans - some, no doubt, even in the offseason.  A more narcissistic bunch of sports fans could hardly be imagined - their constant yapping makes me want to weep and vomit simultaneously and "unparallelled suffering"?  Cry me a river, meatheads 
 This stuff does not work at all! I tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that didn't have negative feedback, save yourself money and do not buy this product. It looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses 
 yaup, i luv redneck jokes..heh he he ..guap! guap! im like so into that.. this dvd rock n roll baby! yah, long live the confederate flag wahooo! yahoo! and the amendment to bare arms! loven the us of a! wahoooo!  recmnds this dvd thingie to all my folk down here in the states of usa! we funny as hell! wahoo! yaup yaup! goaup goaup! yahoo! wahoo! yeahoo! yeeahhoo 
 I've read it. I wish I hadn't The illos are nice, but the backstory makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.  Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see  the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS. 
 From what was a landmark study by ethnobiologist Wade Davis into the folk preparations in the creation of zombies and the belief system associated with Haitian voodoo came a Eurocentric mess of a movie with the same title that was originally released in 1988.  It was reported at the time that Davis only agreed to sell the rights of the book if Peter Weir was hired as the movie director and Mel Gibson would play the leading role (based on Davis). Neither person was ever involved in the movie project.   The DVD cover tells the story as presented by director Wes Craven; the movie strips the book of its exploration into the real history and customs of the religious practices unique to Haitian society and pounds away at the the evilness of voodoo and the destruction it can cause to the human psyche.  In the movie, the scientist is in search of a secret voodoo powder that places people in a simulated death. The setting is in a time of political revolution and the movie does touch upon authentic details of Haitian society. But the action degenerates into the overt racism of the horror genre that gets repeated over and over again; the darker the skin, the more evil the sin.   To save time and money, purchase the book and appreciate the solid research and writing by Davis & disregard the DVD.    
 Amazon strung me along for months before delivering only one volume of the five volume set.  Get it somewhere else 
 I do not recommend this book unless you are more interested in a technical history rather than a layman's history.  It may make a good textbook, but it is not exciting to read 
 The popups in this book were NOT well crafted, they were clunky and didn't always work and with time they quickly cease to function from wear and tear.   One might forgive this passage of time factor were it not for the fact that there is NOTHING imaginative about this book. Its a collection of straightforward boring concepts, nothing new, nothing detailed or exciting, boring boring boring. Do NOT get sucked in by the cool concept and title, this book is a big waste of money.  
 I've had this griddle for maybe a year and use it 3-4 times a month.  Yesterday, I noticed a smell and then saw smoke coming from where you plug the cord into the griddle, I got to it before it started a fire.  My brother-in-law had the same problem with his a few months ago.  This griddle should be recalled, it is a saftey hazard!! 
 My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations.  In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches.  I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower.  I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen.  The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days.  At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop).  I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again.  I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW. 
 I can't believe I read the same book as all of these other people.  Here's what I want to know.  How long did it take Ms. Denay to write this garbage?  Between all the pages of quotes and insets on every page oh, and don't forget the the sixteen pages in the back where the "quoter" is bio-ed, she barely wrote a 10th grade level essay.  I'm a mother of 5 kids, the oldest 14 and I never needed anyone to tell me not to wear sweatpants and maybe comb my hair once in while if I want my husband to still find me attractive. No kidding Ms. Denay, I should make time for my husband AND my kids? Gee, I never thought of that one.  How profound. I would also hope every mom out there doesn't need to be told to "dance" with their kid once in while and I don't mean just to music. Celebrating your children should come naturally or you've got bigger problems than Ms. Denay's handbook is gonna be able to solve. I thought I was going to read something smart and edgy.  Boy, was I disappointed. you have to be the most pathetic mom in the world to be inspired by this book! Want to be a "hot mom" save the purchase price of the book and order some pizza for your family.  Oh, and don't forget to wipe the schmutz off of your face and look presentable.  It's amazing how much I learned from this book. In conclusion, tell me somthin' I don't already know 
 This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks 
 This book is definately mostly about the authors trials and tribulations. It reads kind of awkwardly and clumsy.  I didn't feel that I got to know more about what "actually" went on in the Waco compound on a daily basis. Frankly, it seems to be alot of adolecent "whining" about how hard life is and how much easier it gets when you have a "leader" who makes decisions for you 
 This book is clearly a work of fiction.  Its absurd.  The author has invented theories about the Passion that hold absolutley no water.  He also cannot count apparently.  Christ had 12 disciples not 13 as he says.  The beloved dicsiple in this book is a totally different person than who it really is St John. I didnt find this book offensive, just totally a fictional fantasy of one person.  His theories of the death and resurrection are actually quite humorous, because if they were in the least bit true, Christianity would have went out the window two thousand years ago 
 Using this book is like driving without peripheral vision - you can't take the slightest turn off the single path chosen by the authors. Sure, this book will walk you through making a stateless session bean and deploying it on JBoss. But what if you want to make a client? What if you want to use the Eclipse IDE provided by JBoss? Suddenly, you're left on your own. This book may be helpful to someone making a first pass through J2EE, but if you want to use JBoss for any practical purpose, this book is practically worthless 
 I can't claim to be a hardcore metal fan, but The Haunted has always been one of my concessions to the genera simply for the sheer speed and brutality of their songs.    That's just the problem.  Neither of these things describes The Dead Eye.  This album sounds like dozens of other watered down radio-metal bands that I can hear at any given moment in my car.  There's not a single "Bury Your Dead" or even a "Sweet Relief" present on this disc.  Every song is slow and trudging.  The vocals are almost all sung, which isn't bad in and of itself, however the singing sounds like an imitation of Days of the New or some other second-rate grunge band.    This isn't about keeping an open mind or allowing a band to progress (though, in this case, they've certainly regressed.)  It's about the severe disappointment of expecting one thing that has been great in the past and getting just the opposite.    This may as well be a different band. 
 An absolutely dreadful album, Eve is certainly an apt title--you'll feel as if you've been deceived after listening to this hodgepodge of early 80s FM-ready radio rock. Easily Parsons' worst album, there's really only one listenable song on the entire record. Stick with the far superior APP albums of the late 70s, I Robot, Pyramid, as well as their terrific mid-80s return to art-space rock, Eye in the Sky. It's too bad Eve can't be melted down--it deserves no less a fate 
 I am a GIGANTIC James Brown fan, I have 100 albums, 130 singles, I've met him 5 times, seen him live over 100 times since 1971, had lunch with him in NYC, and I am the 'Paul' in the JB section of Gerri Hirshey's nice history of soul music NOWHERE TO RUN, but if this book was written by James Brown or if he even had much to tell the writer, I'll eat my refrigerator. It is so full of errors that it is laughable. One of the most glaring errors was when Mr. Brown 'supposedly' said, "SAY IT LOUD was where funk started" or something to that effect. That is so ridiculous. James Brown would NEVER say such a thing! Any student of funk knows that COLD SWEAT was the quintessentional funk piece and it is not even mentioned in the book!!! The style of Mr. Brown's sentences that are attributed to him sound NOTHING like him. I have no idea why this was put out. The other 'autobiography' written over a decade ago was more relevent and much better written, THE GODFATHER OF SOUL by JB and Bruce Tucker. Someone, (Alan Leeds?) needs to write a 600 page comprehensive biography of Mr. Brown with much more detail. 
 This book is good for residential licensees perhaps but otherwise is out of date 
 While Kant's work is important for many philosophical reasons (e.g., his splendid arguments for how our minds shape our experiences), this book just happens to find Christianity the most rational of all faiths per lots of  convoluted "reasons" as shallow as they are boring 
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 This book is very much for the Cosmo mag crowd, I'd suggest getting another book if you do not fit into that category. And if you do fall into the crowd, after you read this one you really should check out better books on this subject with more helpful info (even if it isn't as cute). 
 I've read it. I wish I hadn't The illos are nice, but the backstory makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.  Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see  the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS. 
 Another guy who didn't know Bukowski trying to make a quick buck off his corpse. Too bad. A waste of money. Read Bukowski instead. Also, the print is so small you'll need a magnifying glass. Thumbs down. This is the worst of the lot 
  Don't think I'm stupid or don't get the "Roaring 'Twenties"... let me just tell you why it sucks.  Here goes: first of all, everyone in the book writes poetry. I don't even know why I bring this up first, but it bugs me. It's just like everyone reflects Amory. The only good one was by his friend who sooner or later seems to be stifled of his creativity by simply hanging out with the dull Amory.  Another point I have to make is that his one little affair with this country girl is so vague and unclearly written, the only things I understood about it was her poem and a horseback ride.  Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but soon enough, it slowly fell apart. By the end it was just a chaos of words. By the end, when he climbs into a car with a big man with goggles and begins a string of vignettes about his views on society which all go nowhere, the book is just analyzations.  Well anyway, it just had a horrible impact on my life and I hated his little encounter with the man with curly feet. 
 I can understand the enthusiasm behind this little tract (it's not a book, though it costs a book's ransom).  I can understand Timothy Freke wanting to reach out and offer his insights into the true nature of reality.  But this just doesn't give us enough.  Wake up?  Yes, he's right.  Most of us are sound asleep.  But yelling wake up! is no more helpful than telling someone in crisis to "pull their socks up."  Meanwhile, there's so much out there that offers truly stunning glimpses into the nature of consciousness...and I don't mean the desperate brain scientists who keep trying to convince themselves and us that all things wild and wonderful are abberant chemicals gone awry in the brain, very much including after-death experiences.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned Seth.  If you can get past the fact that it's "channeled," a real voice that will turn your world inside out is Seth.  Jane Robert's Seth.  I was a Catholic, but I'm still a philosophy freak.  Read it all my life.  And no one and nothing touches Seth for a cohesive and utterly convincing glimpse into reality as it is/isn't...not Plato, not Socrates, not Plotinus, not the Epicurians, and certainly not the later Gnostics.  As for Lucid Living, well...nope.  Not enough for serious, or even not so serious, seekers 
 Words simply do not express the waste of time this book is.  I cannot believe I even looked at it 
 I found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics, with no insights.  Since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors, and it's only 200  pages in a fairly large typeface, I wasn't expecting historical depth.  But  I was expecting at least one fresh idea.  I bought it on the strength of a  much earlier book by Nathan Rosenberg (about technology in the economy of  the 19th century).  I was disappointed.  I get the feeling the book is  intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower  -- college freshmen born in the 1980s.  I'll bet they find it kinda stodgy 
 WARNING, SPOILER:  Clarissa is hounded by an evil young man whos see her, at first, as nothing more than a challenge. then he is obsessed in possessing her even if it means sullying her honor and breaking her spirit.  Toward the end of the movie, after many twists and turns, when it is clear that she wants nothing to do with him, and rapes her while others hold her down, something I didn't expect at all.  She feels so violated, that she wills herself to die. I hated the story so much that I regret viewing it. Had I known about the rape scene I would not have wasted my time watching this.  Silly me in believing that virture will always triumph--certainly not in this story. If you love Jane Austen and all that her heroines stand for, then don't waste your time on this story 
 I read the whole book. I am a long time AK resident, born and raised.  I've been to 'the bus', I talked with a person who discovered Chris' lifeless body in his sleeping bag many years ago. That conversation lead me to read this book. I found the author attempting to make Chris some sort of 'hero' for what he attempted. He was not.  He committed suicide using his firearm.  He knew that he would starve to death.  I don't understand why he didn't walk out on the high ground. It wouldn't of been easy, but it can be done.  I've done it myself in other drainages, Healy creek for example.  I've walked in the hills for 25 miles back to the road when the creek was at flood stage.  It can be done and if Chris had half a brain he would of known that. In his weakened condition was not thinking clearly or he was not using the brains he was born with.  I just don't understand it, a life wasted.  I am sure that Chris's parents had a big hand in the writing of this book.  I'm guessing that they wouldn't let Jon write the truth on how Chris died.  I guess I don't blame them, but the book has lost lots of credibility with me because it is not factual 
 This is a very good book for an academic setting or for a new RN.  It was not however helpful to me, a nurse with more than two decades of experience.   This book contains rudimentary information, with examples of excellent charting but as a quick reference for unusual circumstances I felt in was cumbersome at best 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 These are mens shoes and I didn't know and ordered a pair.  When I called the company to question them invoicing me for mens shoes they were not very helpful at all. (She thought I should have been able to tell from the picture of the feet.... ummm... it a picture of FEET!!  if they arent in mens dress shoes they are not gender specific!!!)  I think I will take my business elsewhere 
 Let me start by admitting that I am a product of the NOW generation. That means that I need everything from food to entertainment within thirty seconds of request otherwise forget it. I have little patience when it  comes to information that doesn`t make me money, entertain me by dishing  the dirt, or flat out shocking me. Although Mr. Brillsteins intentions here  are not to make me money, he still manages to get all three of the above  wrong and in the process write a snore of a book. Don`t get me wrong if you  are related to Mr. Brillstein or in his will, then I`m sure this is a  masterpiece to you. However, for the rest of society this book will be an  ideal replacemant for counting sheep. Who wants to read about an old man  wrestling with retirement ? Who wants to read about an old manager who  makes himself out to be far more succesful and important than he ever  really was ? I don`t. It`s too late for me but it`s not too late for you.  Do not let the title fool you. Just because it contains the phrase  "someone wants you dead" in it, doesn`t mean that Mr. Brillstein  ever made that much of a ripple in the water. I`m sure that if Ned Flanders  from the Simpsons kept a daily diary that it would be far more exciting and  cutting edge. In closing, if you are not a family member or former client  of Mr. Brillsteins who thinks that their name might be mentioned in this  book, then you don`t want it 
  There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is "surprisingly suggestive" of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled "The Employment Function".R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis 
 This book may have all of Piranesi's work, but the pictures are ridiculously small.  I returned it the day it came in the mail 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 I WORKED THERE BRIEFLY AND THEY'RE RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS AND HAVE NO CLASS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME OF THE STORIES THEY'RE ACCUSING OF MAKING UP ARE TRUE. THEY DESERVE TO BE SUED AND STOPPED. ALL OF THEM ARE REPULSIVE, I'M GLAD I GOT OUT WHEN I DID! 
 Sorry, but I've seen much better dog movies.  My son begged for this movie, based on the cute dogs on the cover.  I don't remember anyone laughing at the pitful jokes, even the kids didn't laugh.  The kids enjoyed the movie, but I wish we had only paid a $3 rental fee 
 This book is the same as "Teach Yourself Origami" and "Origami, the Art of Paper-Folding", just with another cover to make you think it is new, also in the webside they describe it as a book of David Brill, it does not contain nothing of him, not even his name mention!?!? If you have no origami book, it could be good for you, other wise beware!! 
 Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.  The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.  However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in "heaven" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.   Eadie makes a good point that while in "heaven," she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.  The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was "Eve's impatience" or whatever in the "garden of eden" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in "heaven," than she is entitled to her "conclusion."  Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.  Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.  Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.  
 All this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes. I can't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number ANYWHERE to contact customer service.  Don't waste your money unless you love Paris Hilton 
 No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.  Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore. 
 Obviously enough, Buckley had already written as much as he knows about Bowie in his definitive biography, which is definitely worth a read.  This book has apparently just been shoved out there to make some more money; Buckley just provides a few very brief, random, chatty observations about the records. There's neither information nor interpretation, and this book is simply not worth reading, not even for dedicated fans.   Anyone seriously inerested in Bowie should instead try The Complete David Bowie by Nicholas Pegg, which is a mine of information 
 As someone interested in the Russian Revolution, I found this book at a school library and read it. I was not favorably impressed. Lenin is pushed down to the level of megalomaniac idiot. You don't have to like the guy to try to really explain his motivations or to seek real answers to the questions that bamboozle people. In addition to the pyscho-babble mentioned by other reviewers, I had a problem with Robert Service picking on someone who is to dead to sue him for slander. Robert Service accuses Lenin of shooting down his own Soviet troops (an absolute idiocy in the middle of a civil war).It may be fashionable to produce "exposes" of Soviet leaders, but that doesn't make it a good trend. Modern biographers of the Russian revolutionaries need to remember that Joe McCarthy and his Committee are no longer here to black-list them. In Robert Service's biography, I was upset to find the author judging Lenin through 21st century glasses. By this I mean: 1. Cutting out the context of the Russian economy's ruin during the Civil War. 2. The abject failures of the "democrats"  3. Forgetting what the alternatives would have been had the opposition won (I don't mean the Whites- even the peasants hated them) I wonder what Mr. Service would do if he were in Lenin's shoes...  While I'm wondering, I think I'll go pick up W. Bruce Lincoln's books on how the revolution happened and what happened during and after the civil war 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 Hurrah for "sustainability" and "biodiversity"! Down with the human race 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 I am 16 and in love with all Arthurian literature. As I was reading Nancy Springer's "I Am Morgan Le Fay", I got extremely bored. It was so juvenile. Her relationship with Thomas was just odd. It completely destroyed the legend. If you really, and I mean really want to read a great book about Arthurian literature, I can recommend some for you. Obviously, Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece, "The Mists of Avalon" is one of them. Here are some others. **Queen of Camelot ~ Nancy Mckenzie **the Guinevere series ~ Persia Woolley **yet another Guinevere series ~ Sharan Newman **In Camelot's Shadow ~ Sarah Zettel **For Camelot's Honor ~ Sarah Zettel **Prince of Dreams ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Grail Prince ~ Nancy Mckenzie **Sword of the Rightful King ~ Jane Yolen **The Romance of Tristan ~ Beroul **The Firebrand ~ Debra A. Kemp **other works by Marion Zimmer Bradley, such as Priestess of Avalon and The Firebrand 
 The cover of this book declares that you'll learn "Ten Simple Truths That Lead To an Amazing Life."  If your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to "eat, drink, and be merry," then perhaps you'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book.  Alfred E. Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of "What, me? Worry?" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche.  If you're looking for some deeper meaning to life, to success, to accomplishment, you'd be much better served by reading Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Dr. Covey, Denis Waitley, or Brian Tracey.  
 I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there.  Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting.  I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this one 
 The cover is deceptive as to the content. This book I rate minus zero. It contains extremely degrading sadistic text and illustrations through-out without any redeeming qualities.  Amazon should practice greater disclosure when it comes to presenting products with so much abusive content(perhaps a rating system) so those reasonable carefull in there selections do not purchase such dehumanizing content unknowingly. Greater and clearer discloser would benifit both the buyer and seller avoiding uncessary resentment as well as benifit society as a whole.  PS I not religously oriented and liberal in my viewpoints within limits 
 I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.  I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.  Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately.   In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment 
 I bought the book, expecting to know the solution on how to raise my kids so that they become good members of the society. But what I got was just a guideline that I should teach my children well during their early years. It's all too simple to hear from such an expert. There is nothing new on how to raise a moral child compared with what I can get from a good how-to-raise-a-child book. The quality of contents in this book is no way near Emotional Intelligenc 
 After 6 months of use, the LED switch popped out of the coffeemaker's base, which turned the wired plug into an on/off device. I found that Black & Decker no longer services these products and the firm that does doesn't respond to e-mail 
 When mixed as directed had a weak chai taste and no color. Would not buy agai 
 I actually threw this book out.  I never do that but I'd already wasted my money and I didn't want to waste any more of my time or that of anyone else.    It's so terribly put together--typos galore on every page, Sawyerisms double-spaced as space fillers, no original thinking and simple regurgitation of info readily available.  I've also never felt so compelled to write a review...and this marks my first.    P.S.  I would've given it 0 stars but that unfortunately wasn't a choice 
 It's a long, boring book about some old dirt farmer out in bumf&*k, Nebraska beating his wife and having kids he doesn't love.  The end 
 This is not the book.  All you will get is a bunch of worksheets and crossword puzzles that go with the book titled "Structure and Function of the Body".  
 Although very convenient, the reception was not good, and the device broke after a couple of weeks. I would not recommend it 
 Here it is again! Another typically deplorable biography on Thomas Jefferson from another PC historian. What a shame that the American History "profession" has once again provided us with a biased, politically correct, and slander ridden assault on the personage of Thomas Jefferson. Joyce Appleby spends more time bashing him for his views on women, indians,and slaves that you really never see the great human being who wrote the Declaration of Independence. All the typical left-wing anti-white male PC ad hominem attacks are there. I personally would not waste another dime on a book by Appleby, but if one wants a book that once again trashes an American hero, buy this one 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 I loved the concept of the book. I hated the presentation.  The book had too many characters, was wordy, and not even entertaining.   Jill Nelson should have hung out with some 40-something sistas to get the lingo right. She tried to hard to make them hype and they came off fake.  Fiction is not real but dang at least make it interesting.  I think Ms. Nelson should  stay with non-fiction and/or write about her generation and what they really are going through.  Lord have mercy this book gave me a headache.  
      The subject matter of this book is fascinating, no question about it.  I found myself looking beyond the professional-speak to try to get to the heart of the writing, and to understand the treatment methods he uses & discusses.        What really turned me off, though, and caused me to stop reading it completely, was when he relates one instance where, in the name of therapy, he leans over 12 inches from the face of one patient (who by the way he treats on a bed, not a traditional therapist's couch), and ask "do  you want to kiss me?".   (Although he is very careful to say "I don't kiss my patients, but I do permit them to express their feelings verbally.)      As if the people he is treating are not confused and troubled enough......I am certainly no professional, but that alone seems like it would be cause for a lawsuit at the least, or professional license revocation at the most.      That said, there are many other books on the market with a more practical, readable, and sensible approach to the difficult subject of narcissism 
 Not as good as I Love Lucy these four episodes of her later show don't do Lucy justice. Another thing is the quality. DVD's are supposed to be of high quality but they used a very bad film copy when they made this. It  even jumps in a couple places! I'm taking mine back to the store 
 I admire Ross Lowell's inventions enormously. His lights, while not as robust as others and so not so well suited to rental houses, are a great tool for the beginning owner-operator. I began with his Lowel Lights and moved up to his D-heads. I remember them all fondly, even though I no longer use them.  After many years as a director of photography,  I've begun to teach lighting and have been looking at book options for my students. So far the best book I've found on this topic is Blain Brown's "Motion Picture and Video Lighting". While the layout of Lowell's book is stunning, as are many of the images, Lowell approaches each section with long lists which to my mind do nothing to inspire the thinking eye.  With great respect for Lowell, I regretfully report that for me his book is for the encyclopediast, not for the emerging eye.  
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 This was a big disappointment.  Not worth it!!!! 
 This is the usual array of PC middle-class-bashing drivel that you would expect from the Australian cultural studies intelligentsia. Is it any wonder Germaine Greer fled this country? In their efforts to intellectualise sexy topics and seem somewhat relevant to Generation Why, Probyn and Lumby and their contributors interrogate the ethics of `Big Brother', talkback radio and celebrity culture...yet again. As usual, lots of words are put in single-quote marks to red-light their importance: `colonising', `difference', you get the idea. Those two words sum it up, when push comes to shove, it's all Anglo-Saxon Australia's fault - everything, OK? Big revelation - and they use lots of French poststructuralists to prove it, so it must be true, non? 
 Extremely dissapointed.  Product very incomplete, so as to render it nearly useless.  Author tried, but not very hard.  Would not reccomend this guide to anyone 
 I have been working with computers for over 20 years on the home PC side.  I have used Western Digital exclusively since buying my last 170 meg Hayes in 1993.  I have always been happy with Western Digital's ease of installation and great technical support.  There was no question when I purchased this drive as to which manufacturer I would support.  Unfortunately, all the confidence that I had built up over the years was lost in one product.  I will tell you that as a primary drive, this hard drive is very difficult to install.  The directions that the manufacturer provides are great for installing it as a secondary drive, but they provide no information for installing it as a primary, which is important as there is a 130 meg barrier in Windows XP.  Furthermore, when I was finally able to set aside time to contact tech support, they said that my drive, which I purchased 4 days ago, was three days out of its one year warranty!  I had to photoshop together a receipt from screen caps (because I purchased the hard drive online.) to prove the date of purchase.  They now require three days to verify the receipt.  Unfortunately, because of this incident, I will never buy another Western Digital harddrive and would discourage you from doing the same 
 Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published 
 This is my first C.J. Box book and it certainly won't be my last. It was great to read about a hero who had a normal family life and makes a mistake now and then. Other reviews have given the plot line, so I don't think it's necessary for me to do so. However, I would like to say that the author has created believable characters and situations and kept up the suspense all the way through the novel. I liked reading about a wilderness area that I knew nothing about. Great job!  
 It blew chunks. It made me so depressed that I spent the next few weeks throwing up in my bathroom 
 Hello I won't sell you on the show-it's one of my favorites, and you can read other's opinions there.  What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player.  So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable.  It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all.  We don't have this problem with ANY other movies.  SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK.  All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP.  What a shame.  GOOD LUCK 
 This book properly recognizes that election shenanigans are virtually an American tradition, but slinks into pure propaganda with its implicit and explicit contention that Democrats are solely to blame.  But, if there's an equivalent book out there for Democrats that focuses solely on the misdeeds of Republicans, then perhaps we all can agree that elections need protocols to determine fraud by officials, by parties, by voting equipment vendors, and by voters.  And that we especially need officials with an attitude capable of protecting the integrity of elections, and not one that pooh-poohs every conceivable threat.  Fund grossly undervalues two things, greatly damaging the value of his work.  First, he grossly underappreciates insider fraud.  In fact, with secret vote counting now the order of the with electronic voting, economics argues that elections can and will be up for sale to the highest bidder, and we'll never know any better.    Second, he grossly underappreciates the fact that ALL voting systems will be vulnerable and subject to attack, because elections have always been highly competitive events with a unhealthy dollop of dirty tricks.   Because all systems can be compromised, a good voting system is inexpensive and creates witnesses and EVIDENCE when cheating happens and also has a low payoff per election crime, while a bad voting system leaves little or no evidence, and a relatively small number of people can throw the election, getting a high payoff for their election crime.  Guess what?  Electronic voting leaves no evidence of hacking or rigging if it's done properly, insiders are the most likely culprits, and the payoff for a single crime can easily be the whole election.   Paper ballots, while subject to felon voting, double voting and the ills Funds describes in this book, leave EIVDENCE.   In fact, this is the very reason Fund is able to write a book about them!   They were caught, in most cases!    In a democracy we should not be quick to blame the people as pretty soon the people may be considered untrustworthy and then we don't have a democracy any more.  Instead, since voting is a right, let people freely exercise the right, and then punish AFTERWARD the abuse of that right, being careful to create systems where it's hard for an abuse to yield more than one vote.  Paper ballots are easy on the tax dollar, and meet this bill.  Despite the thousands of people trying to cheat the election system, it's a good system, and the rats are getting a might small piece of cheese with paper ballots.  In contrast, you can see Howard Dean on the web hecking an election in less than 60 seconds.   I kid you not.  The only solution is total openness and observation by all parties, watching each other like hawks 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 The cutter worked fine on the first 2 bottles I opened. After that it won't even cut through the foil of another bottle. I had a foil cutter from the rabbit opener that lasted for 2 yrs until the plastic broke in half. This one isn't worth it 
 It just astonished me as how certain discursive formations can actually lead people to believe as the 'real' reality. It does not matter whether for an event to 'really happen' or not. What matters is that you hear it on a radio or read it on a newspaper or website or even talk about it at the water-cooler. Those who have had the chance to watch 'Wag the Dog' might get the idea of how such 'reality' is constructed.  On a more advanced level 'discursivity', a la Foucault, is a building block of a discourse in which certain linkages, here and their, add to what ordinary people believe on the street.  Now obviously Hitler was one of the worst things that happened during the 20th century. This is commonsense. But to add certain 'material' so as to advance another claim by building upon Hitler, is something that should be carefully approached, at least for people who at least visit and read stuff through Amazon. If a chain in a series of discursive formations can be shown to be weak or invalid than it would be proven that that chain of a discourse is on shaky grounds, and that most of what is known about it is likely to be false. Unfortunately we see certain 'material' is attached to certain claims so as to resemble the Holocaust. Let us revisit a single claim on part of those would like to exploit the events during the early 20th century. A reviewer, for instance, obviously bought one claim and thus knows it to be the 'truth'  Adolf Hitler: "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  Now has anybody bothered to investigate it. No, of course. "It sounds like as if it is true, so why not believe it". Well fortunately there are still people who like investigating such stuff. Read for example : Heath W. Lowry Washington, D.C. Political Communication and Persuasion, Volume 3, Number 2 (1985) Abstract This article traces the history of a purported Adolf Hitler quote which cites the perecent of the world's lack of reaction to the fate of Armenians during the First World War as a justification for his planned extermination of European Jewry in the course of the Second World War. By a detailed examination of the genesis of this quotation the author demonstrates that there is no historical basis for attributing such a statement to Hitler... [...] If one is serious about really getting into history, rather than believing simply what is out their in the popular press, I would additionally suggest to take a tour of the documents of Ambassador Morgenthau. First let us not take any word for having a Godly truth 'Its ambassador so its gotta be true' mentality is ok if you're ok with it (respect of thought). But there are historical evidence that suggests that Morgenthau did not even know Ottoman scripture, and that this is proved throughout his letters when he attempts to translate 'words' and 'dates' of events. Do not hesitate to read... [...]   For those who have CAREFULLY read what I have written so far, notice I am not either on one side of the argument between Armenian historians or historians of the Ottoman empire, but that I have just thrown out some thought provoking information so that one will at least ask some questions before believing what they read. Doubtless there will be those occasional pointless replies to this review, but again all I am saying is, think before you react. Now one could argue that I am saying is a postmodernist crituque and historical relativism. That would be false. I believe in historical analysis, as a scientific enterprise (and only the scientific version of it). But then again let us not forget that some American historians who were studying the case at hand were bombed by Armenians. Now if history is written by historians and that some historians (i.e. UCLA professor Stanford Shaw)are bullied so as not to investigate certain historical matters than, at least if you have a capacity to think critically than be suspicious about it. [...] By the way absolutely nothing is mentioned about the equal ammount of civilian Turks that were slaugthered by Russian backed Armenian militia. Nor anything about the terrorism campaign of Armenians during the 1970's that left thousands of people dead and wounded. To say "denying genocide is a wrong thing" is one thing. But in doing so if one is denying the death of tens of thousands of innocent Turks, is called hypocrism and puts one in ethically shaky grounds.    The latest British governemeents acceptance that the "blue book", which Armenian claims are based upon, have been declared by the government itself to be a WW1 time propaganda material. Yes you heard it right!  Here's another eye opener: Often the claim is made there 1 million Armenians were murdered. What they do not say that the same material they indicate that a "genocide" happened says that  the ENTIRE Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire was 800 thousand (200 thousand difference!) MOREOVER Keep in mind that the Armenian diaspora, that builds its own desire to have a national identity, has a population of more than 9 million people across the world. HOW CAN this be??? Well thats how nationalism is formed: impossibile numbers, man on white horse, the evil "other" etc.... So this "genocide" attitude is more of identity building rather than real history.     Well I hope I contributed on an intellectual level and I hope 'thought thugs' would not misunderstand what I have suggested. 
 Let me first start off by saying that Richard Gere is in my opinion a very so, so actor and in this movie, his crazy irish accent bugged me.and seemed forced. But, still, it's a descent movie thanks to Bruce Willis, perfect for the vilain in this movie. Jack Black also makes a short cameo but Bruce makes sure he doesn't stay alive for long.  The movie is basically about a prisoner released from prison to track down a man that only him and his girlfriend can identify.  And then, comes a very average move with some good scenes. all resulting around Bruce Willis. The problem for me is that at times, I wasn't cheering Richard Gere on whatsoever. That could have to do with his acting. On the other hand, Willis is great and very effective and also..very cool. But, what looks like it's going to be a good suspense movie ends out being like all action movies. and that my friend is something I seriously am tired of. Now, that I think of it, I own this movie. You know what that means. Hello Blockbuster 
 I had my weeds identified at the local Ag office and only 1 was in the book and Mr Walters never said how to or what to do to control it w/o poison, plus it was not written in laymans language.There was very little reference to any other weeds and how to control them w/o poisons 
 This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a  good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called "hormonal balance" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on "get more sleep....exercise....etc". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there 
 How could so many people regard those lads as the saviours of rock and roll?Does it need to be saved at all?There is much more interesting music that branched off rock'n'roll anyway.Look beyond the messy hairstyles,the unironed shirts with loose neckties and ripped converse's.The prep school drop-out image is getting so worn out.There is a huge wave of manufactured rock bands for the past few years and The Strokes were among the first successful breakthrough's.After three albums, the sound has barely evolved, and it doesn't even rock,with couple of exceptions.What pisses me off the most is when they are compared with The Libertines, perhaps the only important act that came out of the alleged punk revival thing.The Libertines had Pete Doherty, hence the substance, they carry a message.Not to mention that their rough sound is so catchy and authentic.Work on your taste,don't believe the industry 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 There is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary: It is well presented with great CGIs, narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars (whatever this stars rating business means).  The problem is the substance: it is simply not there. Menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists (as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it.  I think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence. Menzies, starts off with his conclusion (rather than ending with it) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it. When all alleged evidence is demolished, he arrogantly states that he will not budge, "one millimetre" as he puts it, from his theory and that, in time, everyone will accept it as a fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.  A true scientist, even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint, always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future. Menzies does exactly the opposite: with no evidence on his side, he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong.  It saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea, Menzies - not a scientist but, at best, a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that PBS, helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him. The feeling one gets at the end, is that PBS ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap's air-ology.  Whilst visually pleasing, this PBS production is in substance a waste of time to watch, as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer 
 This book had a lot of interesting ideas, but it also had many flaws.  It purports to be an introduction to the area of cultural history, but the essays assume the readers have a certain amount of knowledge.  Beyond that,  it is also poorly written.  As a 3rd-year history/English major, I often  had some trouble following the arguments this volume made.  The authors  could have articulated themselves much better.  I have to say, the area of  cultural history is fascinating, but I would like to think that there are  clearer volumes out there 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 GIRLZ ROCK????  Dude, at least use proper grammar if you wanna be taken seriously. A pure sign that you're trying to appeal to 10-year-olds who believe there's such a thing as "girl power! omg giggle giggle"... oh, and can't spell 
 This book has some very good advice about knowing when to speak up and knowing when to be silent when your daughter is expressing herself.  It is also frought with some very bad advice about allowing "experimentation" in your daughters life.  I was confused about how one section deals with teaching girls that their self worth is not tied up in their bodies, then giving dads the advice to allow a daughter to wear provocative clothing.  I quote, "wearing sexy clothing is a normal adolescent behavior".  Some daughters might be all the better for allowing boys to ogle them, but mine better keep the receipt.  I say no thank you to most of the advice given in this book.  Dad isn't meant to be a passive listener and enabler.  Sometimes, Dad is supposed to put his foot down and say that some things are unnacceptable 
 This book was way too basic. It mainly said play super tight and move all in against "Phils" so they can't outplay you.  Tell me something I don't kno 
 ..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.  Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out.   This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..." with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more "cool".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake.  Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt.   I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic".     If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are.  The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.    I gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option.  Joss Stone is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another, better culture 
 I had high hopes for this book since it is set in Mississippi and since I was under the impression that it had to do a bit with music from my generation.  However, if I had wanted a book exclusively designed around music, who wrote it, who recorded it, when they did it (both), what category it arguably falls in, and what arguments for and against each and every song from each and every album, and so on, ad nauseum, I would have just bought a book on music history covering the late 60's and early 70's. I know there must be a story somewhere in the 350+ pages, but I don't have the patience to skip the endless blather about songs and singers in between mentions of the plot that reading the whole thing would require.  I wouldn't bother with anything else written by this author 
 This is a well written book, however, I feel I should point out several issues I have with this book, which seems to follow the formula of the "modern teen problem novel".  This novel "explores difficult emotions" such as selfishness,jealousy, and alienation from God. All characters who are devoutly religious are portrayed as either uneducated or mean, and any "enlightened" characters or heroes are portrayed as not being religious.( Does anyone really know any Christians who go around , Bible-in-hand, accusing other women of "whoredom"?) And what modern teen "problem novel" would be complete without some sexual themes, and at least a brief discussion of menstruation ?  At the book's end, our main character chooses to continue in her career after the birth of first child. Parents should also be advised that Sara Louise's "coming of age" includes rejecting religion.( Although, to be fair, the book does not portray Sara as a happy person, but I think this subtlety will be lost on children.)  Judging by other reviews, most child readers did not pick up on the fact that Caroline was a much kinder and more likable person than Sara Louise.  An adult reader who is wise to the anti-religious bias may enjoy the book ( if they're not grossed out by the idea of a 14 year old having a crush on a 70 year old man). If you are looking for a book about a normal child, with normal child feelings, dealing with her "perfect" sister, read Little House on the Prairie and leave this book on the shelf. Appropriate reading for adults, who can understand the bias against religion, but not at all recommended for children. 
 Diana Ross can sing "Someone That You Loved Before" a hell of a lto better. I got his version on mp3 when I found out it was co-written by him. It is a girlie song. Diana Ross sings it much better 
 After a few months use the camera got persnickety, often demanding upon startup that I restart it. Now that the camera has completely broken down, with the lens fully extended and stuck in place, I think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. Another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review, flash, etc., quickly wore off, and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. Not a big deal in itself, but annoying given the other problem.  The lens is prone to strange flaring, especially indoors, where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. Several photos were ruined, or have required tedious photoshopping. Otherwise, the lens is fine and reasonably sharp, although nothing to write home about.  The camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models, e.g., Canon A610. Many frames are motion-blurred, as well. There are ways to avoid this, but I didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure, thank you.  There are a few things to recommend it: Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. Those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. It is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus, see above.) The jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. Skintones are good.  Still, with the durability issue, this one's not worth it. Lucky for me, unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown, I did keep the receipt. Anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo 
 The product description for Killers' 'Hot Fuss' describes it as 'eleven nuggets of reel-you-in storytelling genius'. Come on. With the exception of 'Somebody Told Me', the lead singer runs the gamut of emotions from A to B (to paraphrase Dorothy Parker). 'Mr. Brightside' features all of 3 or 4 notes total and banal lyrics that are repeated, in full twice. No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses. 
 When REA (Research & Education Association) released its initial version of GRE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH in 1989, I bought it to prepare myself for that test.  I was not particularly impressed with the organization or the lack of suggestion as to how to best make use of the material presented. Still, authors Beard, Kennedy, Liftig, and Malek included six full length exams with explanations.  That was 230 x 6 or 1,380 test prep questions. I took the test and scored middlingly.  Years later, I learned to "psyche" out the test and was surprised to discover a new and supposedly updated version.  In this newer version, Malek cuts down the number of tests from 6 to 3. Nearly every one of the regurgitated questions is a reprint from nearly 15 years ago, thus ensuring that this text does not reflect any of the major changes in test content during that time. What Malek does try is to emulate the far more successful paradign put out by the Princeton Review's CRACKING THE GRE LITERATURE by codifying the vast array of western literature: genres, timelines, book and author lists, literary terms, schools of literary criticism, etc. The problem is that Malek did not do half as thorough a job as the Princeton Review did. Malek does little more than to use an overly broad brush to skim a distressingly long list of required readings without giving any hint as how to best do that. True, neither did the Princeton Review, but at least the latter presented a methodology that was reasonable. This is not to say that Malek's updated text is useless. Anything, no matter how scant, that prepares you for a mind-numbing test has its uses, but if you insist on using Malek, you might prefer to go to the library to find the 1989 version that gives more preparation than its more recent cousin.  By the way, Malek's test questions themselves: many of them are so outlandish that one is amazed that he thinks ETS will ask such trivia.   You have been warned. 
 I'm a big fan of Carly phillips but I could not get through this book. I kept trying to finish it but it became too much work and not enough entertainment. If you're going to read a Carly Phillips book I wouldn't suggest this one. Her other books are fantastic though 
 If you are looking for a book on Joseph Campbell, think again.  Instead you will receive a hodge podge of Diane Osbon's thoughts and her own perspective of life- disapointing 
 I read this book years ago when it was first published.  Mr. Sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of Iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence.  Some of the people Sick listened to were shown in the Iran-Contra hearings to be con artists who also took in Ollie North and Bill Casey.  These con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear.  One guy claimed to have been in Special Forces and was an eyewitness to one of VP-candidate Bush's flights to meet with Iranians.  It turns out that he was not in Special Forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the US Army.  In addition, he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time.  The phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work.  By the time I finished this book, I actually felt sorry for Sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers.  He clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true.  This book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe.  Subsequent investigations by a Democratically dominated Congress proved that there was no October surprise 
 I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off. 
 This is one of those books where all the best parts can be found on the book jacket!  I was intrigued by the book jacket description of the Swap Shop Show:  "If you've got something you're itching to sell, something  you mighta never woulda bought no way, then give us a call," but this  idea isn't expanded upon in the text.  Instead, this seems to be another in  a series of recent books where the authors seem to believe a series of  quirky characters alone a great novel make.  Not so.  Readers want  characters they can get to know, characters who grow and change throughout  the book, not a series of semi-related vignettes about cardboard cutouts of  people.  I particularly found McCorkle unable to handle the parallel story  lines well.  Perhaps the plot ties together in the end (I just couldn't get  that far, I really tried!), but the impression I got was of jerking back  and forth between stories that may have stood better on their own.  For  examples of successful books employing the parallel-lives technique, see  Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full* or Michelle Huneven's *Round Rock.*  I've  gathered in reading reviews that McCorkle is being hailed as a great new  Southern author; I found no Southern flavor at all in this book.  These  silly characters could have lived anywhere.  I guess I'll stick to Rita Mae  Brown when I want a taste of the South 
 The problem with all Indian cultural analysts living outside India including those writing on cinema is that while they fulfill a mandatory understanding of the cultural theories in vogue at the undergraduate level  in the US, Europe and Australia, they display a singular lack of  sensitivity while dealing with the material at hand. Their survival,  therefore, depends almost entirely on their reader's lack of knowledge of  the field of study which will include amongst other things the native  language, the local history as well as the local lores. On all these counts  Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose.  There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the  relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.  There are descriptions - such as the music composer SD Burman being  described as a baul singer - which are downright ridiculous. And, of  course, her command of the Hindi language is unquestionably poor! Surely  the West and the East deserve a better introduction to the Indian cinema  than this book 
       Never before has such a poorly written book received such acclaim. Maya Angelou wrote this story not with candor and grace but with a bias rarely allowed to sit on shelves let alone the top of a best-seller list. She was not humorous but had a heinousness of character and action that places her beyond the limits of human pity. This "inspiring author" did not demonstrate poignancy and depth but the crude rudiments of writing skill below that found in the essays of a primary school student.               Maya Angelou has portrayed herself as a victim of fate and yet at best her actions can only be described as foolhardy. In an attempt to prove to herself that she isn't a lesbian (a term she apparently doesn't understand) she initiates a deed without thinking of the consequences. She repeatedly gratifies her ego by exalting her academic accomplishments, yet doesn't grasp the fallacies of her own actions until it is far too late.             Several fans have seen her as an example to women. I must disagree with this ardently. Every teenage girl using her as a role model and demonstrating such lack of forethought puts herself at risk for sexual assualt, neglect, STDs, and teen pregnancy.             My only hope for this book is a quick and discreet cremation. May her name never be mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Atwood or any other great modern writer of either gender, and ANY nationality 
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 At first glance, profiling seems to be about someone trying to understand and decipher the mind of a person who kills. It's often promoted as entering the mind of this person and discovering why and how this person became and acts this way. This is not exactly how it seems to be though. Throughout this book, the author points out common elements between the killers, things that reoccur. This appears to be the whole of his job. He interviews these people and collects patterns. He is very good at drawing similarities between killers and using this, but when it comes down to actually understanding "why" they did it, he falls hopelessly short. According to the author, they did it because they were "losers" or "inadequate". This is far too simplistic, and the author isn't able to understand the complex intereactions that make a person kill. He catches these people because they follow similar and predictable patterns, but not because he can put himself inside their minds and feel what they do.  This may be annoying to some readers, who I'm sure, have formed their own opinions of why they believe someone would kill. This book is basically an overview of the common patterns amongst killers, but in no way does it delve into deep discussion on why these patterns are the way they are. The author has a large degree of anger toward these killers, which, I'm sure is a pretty normal reaction in his position when you think about it. The only thing is that most of us out here are trying to understand, but not to judge explicitly. We want to know why, we don't want to hear the author's emotional outbursts. On the other hand though, this makes the book slightly interesting because what we have here is not a discription about why killers do these things, but a depiction of a profiler and how he sees the world around him. How he percieves it, his personality and how it has effected him. Don't read this book for its analysis or you'll be dissapointed. Read it instead to gain insight into his life and the things around him.  The only other thing that might annoy some people is if they are assuming that because of his job, the author is highly intellegent. Because he isn't. He seems pretty average in that department, he is just very good at sussing out similarities. So, I'll say it again, there is no intellectual discuss on the complexities of human emotions and how or why they are the way they are. The authors world is very black and white, and you can't help but feel a little sorry for him.  Either way. Two stars because it is an interesting view port into this man's world. But no other three stars, because its just too childish.  
 As a longtime visitor to Something Awful I have grown to enjoy Parson's   writing immensely. When purchasing this book I expected to read a light, humorous account of WWII inventions gone wrong. In reality, the book is a ponderous recitation of those inventions replete with plenty of mind-numbing technical details and absent of anything remotely resembling humor. Hopefully SA/Parson's next literary venture will help us forget this stinker.  
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 Don't get me wrong, the idea of taking a list of the greatest movies and then writing a series of books detailing the movie and its impact is a fascinating idea.  The book by Anton Kaes on "M" is a stellar example of how the movie and book compliment each other.  But here, in another Fritz Lang film the idea is torture.  I could never get what the author was trying to say, he rambled on and on and never got to a point.  It is neither a book of film criticism, nor a book on the times depected, nor quite frankly of anything else.  I love Metropolis, I have seen it many times, in both the Moreder version and the incomplete silent versions.  It is a masterpiece, this book is not.  Watch and read M instead 
 what the hell is this!!!   Don't see this movie at all.I don't know what these people are on    ,but don't believe their lies.the story goes when this kid and his mental girlfriend are in a motercycle accident and the kid's girlfriend dies so he brings her back with 2-4-5 trixon.get this know the zombies eat flesh(you heard me,"flesh"not brains but "flesh").if you own this movie take it out to the back yard and eighther shoot it with a BB gun or burn it 
 A basically dishonest movie, lacking the courage of its convictions. This oscar-winning movie is in favor of illegal abortion, adultery, law breaking, disobedience of authority, yet it is shot in soft focus, like a Capra, feel-good movie!. The constant references to Dickens are more wishful than actual; old Charles would most likely be against all the values this film celebrate 
 this book may have helped others, but it severely bored me. i had and extremely disturbed childhood. this book was just too basic for me, i dont feel it was written very well at all. 
 Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite "Always" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 Would love to review but have not received anything yet!  What's up wit dat? 
 This book is a poor rip-off of Jennifer Briggs' much classier Strive to Excel: The Wit, Will & Wisdom of Vince Lombardi. George is a politician with book editor connections, not a writer--and it shows in his clumbsy  writing and diction. Briggs' Strive to Excel is a much better read on  Lombardi. And I'd expect it to be. She's an award-winning sportswriter  who's written for USA Today, SI, etc. Buy Brigg's book, not George's fluff 
 I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy 
 I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I  can't 
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 Pulse stars Madeleine Stowe (Unlawful Entry, Avenging Angelo), Norman Reedus (Blade 2, Gossip, Boondock Saints), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (upcoming Elvis, Alexander, Velvet Goldmine), Mischa Barton (Tv's The O.C., Lost and Delirious) and Bijou Phillips (Bully, Black & White). Stowe and daughter Barton are on the road...they have a typical daughter/mother spat and Barton winds up being taken away by a group of people, led by bad boy Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Stowe then goes on a hunt for her daughter. Along the way she encounters a strange towtruck man, played by Norman Reedus. So, Stowe goes off on a rampage to get her daughter back from her kidnappers. Not much pulse in this movie...its faint and can barely feel it. Some good direction, mixed in with a pyshco performance by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers keeps it at bay. 
 The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.  
 This book represents itself as an academic discussion of the family in Buffy and Angel, and is dressed in the jargon of contemporary criticism, but is a largely unreadable essay of personal reflections about what the programs mean to the author. Better choices for the academic fan are Jowett's Sex and the Slayer or Wilcox' Why Buffy Matters or any of the collections of shorter pieces available in book form or on line, or, on the other hand, for the pleasure of well written personal essays with insight, Seven Seasons of Buffy. This is least successful of the growing number of Buffy studies. 
 My glasses had air bubbles and abnormally shaped blobs of glass where the stems connect to the bowls.  They were functional.... but deformed.  I sent them back.  In addition, molding lines were visible, but not so bad 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 I didn't like these at all.  The toes are too pointy and wouldn't fit.  Might be ok for younger children than stated.  
 After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself...  Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to "catch" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.  Anyway, I think this perfume is too "old lady" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.  For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You 
 If you are a musician or have a good background in music playing, this CD is not recommended for you; period. This CD is played by computer devices, creating an electronic organized pretty sound, topped by a basic guitar playing. Nothing to add except the music can be played and appreciated in an elevator, grocery store or shopping malls. (Have you ever noticed that when someone writes a review and doesn't give 4 or 5 stars, how he or she gets slammed in the votes?)   
 After this latest half-assed attempt by Ryan Adams, at times brilliant and other times atrociously bad, he may very well be named the Joyce Carol Oates of country alternative.  Mr. Adams, let's face it, is a polluter, an extremely talented artist who is miring his most masterful accomplishments in tracks that are but creative waste.  There is something to be said for an artist who knows when to discriminate and keeps his throw-away tracks locked in a trunk somewhere to be released on a b-side box set once he's dead and gone.  Not so with Mr. Adams, who seems to be lacking this discriminatory mechanism in his brain.  Like the gratuitously unpleasant "Blossom" from his last 2-disc release (which was, what, a few weeks ago?), this 14-track CD is peppered with songs that go beyond mediocre into a realm closer to laziness.  All the songwriting talent that was required for "Don't Fail Me Now" was coming up with the clich title and knowing how to copy and paste it 20 times; and "September" is almost a flip of the bird to anyone who's ever spent months trying to write the perfect sad song.  When albums like this come out, I'm thankful for online programs like iTunes that allow you to download songs individually.  Because, frankly, I think both Mr. Adams and his fans would be better served if gems like "A Kiss Before I Go" weren't followed by the uninspired filler that is "Hard Way to Fall" and the like .. 
 On the package it says 3 X 5 postcard size paper.  We thought it was describing the size of the paper which we wanted for prints.  However, it was 3 X 5 postcard stock which was a little deceiving.  WE will use it but it is not what we wanted 
 I was eagerly awaiting this release for a few reasons, the main one being that I was anxious to get Edith Massey's "Big Girls Don't Cry" on cd.  Imagine my horror when I queued that track up and realized that that track was mastered from vinyl that's very scratched and not even balanced properly between the channels.  It's either fake stereo or mono with the channel balance off.  Did John Waters (or whoever put the sources together for him) not have a copy of the Rhino "World's Worst Records" album?  If they couldn't find a master tape for this song, at least taking it from the Rhino compilation would have resulted in a reasonable mix.  Some other tracks sound similarly bad for no reason.  Ray Charles' "The Right Time" has been issued on countless cds from master tape but on this cd it's taken from a VERY scratchy 45 rpm record.  Why?  I'm not actually sure that ANY of the songs on this cd were taken from tape, though the scratches are at a minimum on several of the songs.  It seems that someone just sat down with their record collection and transferred a bunch of records to a computer to burn a cd compilation.  I can do that level of quality at home.  Quite honestly I intend to "fix" this compilation for myself by replacing a "needle drop" that I had already done of Edith Massey's track for the one here, replacing the Ray Charles track with a copy ripped from another cd, and perhaps replacing some other tracks (I haven't analyzed the disc enough yet) then then reburning my own compilation.  Then this disc will go back to a used cd store.  I am a HUGE John Waters fan and even waited in line to buy his Christmas compilation cd and get his autograph.  That cd was well done.  This cd is junk.  Shame on John Waters for allowing his name and face to be connected to such a low quality product.  (Yes, I know that his early films featured unlicensed music snippets taken from scratchy records, but that was over 30 years ago when he was poor. 
 but Ridley devotes too much space regurgitating tired, old, discredited dogmas on both sides of the nature-versus-nurture debate. I think his views are self-evident to many non-specialists, like myself, outside the sociobiolgical fishbowl.     As a physical scientist, I am often disturbed by the (in my opinion) misplaced empiricisms of behavioural/social scientists. For exapmle, in one part of the book, Ridley describes a "remarkable" experiment that found children with a certain high-active gene (MAOA) are "virtually immune" to the detrimental effects of mistreatment by their care-givers, and did not "get into trouble much", as compared to those with low-active versions of the gene. The implication is that this could become a tool of social policy. The thought of engineers building Jumbo Jets according to principles of gravitation, mechanics, and fluid dynamics that "ought to work a lot of the time" would be a disaster in the making - much like, in my opinion, social policy built along the thinking he outlines. Personally, I would be much more interested in low and high-ative MAOA children who flaunt the conventional conclusions of the study (of which I assume there are some, based on the language). Perhaps it is the exceptions that hold the key.     I'm not saying that physics/math/engineering is superior to the social/behavioural sciences. I think that it is important to know where the fuzzy edges of reductionist-empiricisms lie, and where to draw boundaries around them. I just think that physical scientists, by the nature of their fields, tend to have better tools for drawing and testing these boundaries. Without these boundaries, there seems to be a temptation to take conclusions too far, and be lead astray as a result. 
 I was very disappointed with this movie.  The original with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin was absolutely hilarious!  This one was a bomb in its own right, but next to the original, it was a downright disaster.  Do yourself a favor.  Spend your hard-earned money on the original movie instead of this terrible remake.  You'll love it 
 This book can be summed up by saying.... preachers should ~not~ be hypocrites.  The author calls up many quotes from worthy divines of yesteryear.  I've read several books that addressed this topic in recent years so I didn't find much fresh here, but if you haven't been doing any reading in this area I recommend this little work 
 I have been a big Rumpole fan every since the PBS series, and I thought I'd give one of Mortimer's other books a try. If he could strike gold with Horace Rumpole, why not with Lucy Purefoy? Unfortunately, no such luck.  	Lucinda Purefoy is a bishop's daughter recently graduated from college. She takes an advertising job, but something is missing, so she decides to volunteer for an organization called SCRAP, Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors, who help former prisoners readjust to society. That's how she meets Terry Keegan who's just done four years for breaking and entering. They fall in love.  	The conflict begins when Terry tries to explain to Lucy why he got into burglary in the first place. "It's not for the money," he says, "It's  the excitement." She wants to get closer to Terry so she decides to try it for herself. She begins by shoplifting. When Terry finds out about it, the roles are reversed. Now he's the one trying to get her to go straight.   	When Terry looks down his nose at her trivial efforts, she decides to increase the stakes. There lies the problem with the book. It's just not believable; it reads more like Bridget Jones's Diary than a crime caper. I would imagine Mortimer was trying to lampoon do-gooders here, but Lucy is such a dim bulb that the reader is constantly telling himself, "She can't be serious!"  	The minor characters are worse. Lucy's father the bishop is more liberal than Teddy Kennedy. When he finds out Lucy is sleeping with Terry, he's all for it. Also, when the leader of SCRAP resigns, they solicit Terry's criminal overseer, Chippy McGrath, to take his place. Mr. Markby, Terry's parole officer, is just as clueless. These people just don't measure up to the Rumpole characters. Somebody should have had the courage to tell this to Mr. Mortimer 
 Dr. Lehman will step on your independent toes and leave them broken and bruised!  I purchased this book just after becoming a first-time mom a few months back.  I enjoyed cruising along in this book full of some good advice until everything came to a screeching halt at Chapter 6 where Dr. Lehman, quite frankly, states that I am letting someone else raise my children because I am a working mother.  The entire chapter was full of his own opinions stated as fact and his reminiscing of his own childhood and how one day his mother told him to fix himself a sandwich and he said something to the effect of, "Oh, but it tastes so much better when you make it for me."  At which time she then proceeds to fix him his sandwich.  That's one more man in this world that can't fix his own sandwich!  I, for one, quickly realized that Dr. Lehman believes that a woman's place is in the home regardless of financial situations, her independence and her sense of self.  To work outside the home, inside the home, or to be a stay-at-home mom is up to each individual family and what works for others may not work for some.  I wish I had my money back that I spent on this book.  The money that I made "while someone else was raising my children" as I educate the youth of our country every day.  My own money which I made - that allowed me to purchase Dr. Lehman's book in the first place 
 I had great hopes for this book, as I do for anything that continues the work of Jane Austen, but I was very disappointed. I did not find Ms. Tennant's Elizabeth at all like the original. She had no spirit! And Darcy was even more autocratic and uncommunicative than in the original. Moreso, the book did not continue based upon details given in the original in many particulars - Mrs. Collins discovers a first pregnancy that had already been revealed in the ending chapters of Pride & Prejudice, and Mr. Bennett is dead, when in the original, he delights in popping in unexpectedly at Pemberly. Better research and a better understanding of the original stories and character are required in my opinion. Not worth the read. The writing style, although consistent with the original, makes too much of reiterating certain phrases. Ms. Austen did not do this herself in her works. I have read many, many Pride & Prejudice continuances, and I found this one weak. I have enjoyed the Carrie Brebis books, and I liked the series of three (I'm sorry I can't recall the author) that viewed the story from Darcy's point of view. 
 A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I  was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers 
 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 I just couldn't stand this album. They sound like a billion other bands except 100 times worse.  I don't see why people would listen to it.  There are so many other good christian bands out there.  For example my favorite band MxPx. Supertones, Five Iron Frenzy, Calibretto 13, Craig's Brother, Roper, and even Relient K is better.  I, unfortunately, have seen them live.  They opened for Supertones. They do not put on a good show.  About the cd.  It just has no originality.  It would be much better if they did something new, not something everyone has heard a billion times before.  You should not buy this cd, I recomend buying any MxPx cds. They are amazing. 
 Bought this dvd for only 10 dollars at a not-so-local shopping centre, only because they didn't have this movie to rent at the video shop.  After so much publicity, trailers, ads on busses, you'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around.  However. I nearly fell asleep in it. Had to turn away more than a few times in boredom. And cliched to infinity, just watch the ending.  Pathetic and predictable. If you like predictable movies? This dvd will be your new best friend. If not? Try something with a bit more imagination 
 I tried this one based on other submitted reviews and was sorely disappointed. Where were the scares? A little trippy, it hints at being a countercultural horror film: Easy Rider on Vampire Island.  Interior monologue from our heroine, Jessica, reflects her insecurities about what her friends will think of her, but offer no insights into her mental illness. This is the film's one and only device. And the filmmakers have no idea what to do with it.  BORING 
 If you enjoy good literature give this one a pass.  This book is trite, boring, predicatable and cliche.  There is nothing new or noteworthy about Mr. Pezzeli's prose.  Striclty dullsville 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful.    After that, the format became a bit tired.  The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over.  It just became boring after a while.  Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy.  From there, proceed with caution 
 I really wanted so much to like this book, but I was pretty disappointed. I had expected something much more advanced. This book is for complete beginners with not a creative bone in their body who need to be told to sew buttons back onto their pants instead of just throwing them away. Maybe it was meant for a much younger audience (I'm 30) or people with no experience in the DIY world.   I love the concept! I am looking forward to the next work from the authors and hope it will be more technically skilled. 
 As a French Quarter resident in New Orleans who is concerned about our City's historic preservation, I have an active interest in books that capture the evolution of this City.  Upon seeing Mr. Sullivan's book at a local shop, I was shocked to see the degree to which pictures and captions were copied outright from the original and more comprehensive book by the SAME TITLE from 1999 by Richard and Marina Campanella.  Don't buy this book.  It is a shabby mimic of the original masterpiece and buying it supports the act of plagarism 
 a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here. 
 I like Bob Greene but I don't buy his books, (or any for that matter) I go to my local library and check them out.  It's FREE!!!  I am in the middle of the book and the product placement is sad.  I'm all for the idea of endorsing something you believe is really great but some of the foods on the list are not ok with me.  I don't do high fructose corn syrup in ANYTHING!!!  Some are legitimate.  If you want a good food only book check out Dr. Phil's paperback 'Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide' excellent book if you want to know about food.  I do agree with Bob's philosophy (or call it fact) you have to move to burn more than you consume and that is just common sense.  Also like the two week menu in Phase 2.  At our house we are always looking to change things up a bit 
 I had never read a Lucy Monroe book before.  I bought 3 of them at once  based on the good reviews they got.  I read 'The Real Deal' and really enjoyed it so I immediately started in on 'And Able.'  Am I the only one that noticed carbon copy scenes and dialogue from her previous book???  A lot of authors use a formula for their books, I just don't remember one that uses almost word for word lines of dialogue and identical scenes in 2 different books.  I had an order for a 4th Lucy Monroe book but have canceled it because it would be more of the same old stuff that I've already read 
 Prospective readers should be aware that this book promotes the long-discredited psychoanalytic view of autism as an emotional disturbance. Full of bizarre interpretations which have remarkably little to do with the subjective experience of autism as described in first-person accounts such as those by Temple Grandin. Interesting enough in its way, but nothing to do with autism 
 this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.  
 I went into this movie expecting to see something I hadn't seen.  There are alot of cool actors in here, so I was expecting some good characters too.  Well, there is nothing in this movie you haven't seen before.  There is absolutely NO visual style at all.  There is no soundtrack.  Every shot is hand held.  This would make a good HBO movie, but it's pretty average.  Who are we supposed to root for?  I don't think we're supposed to root for the Nazis.  How can we root for the Jews who are fighting against the other Jews to get "special privileges"?  There is really no character development, I never learned anyones name and it was sort of difficult to figure out what the plot was about.  With only 2 powerful scenes at tops, this movie can't dig itself out of the average pit 
 I have been a Nickatina fan ever since The New Jim Jones had its record release when he was down with IMP and Totally Insane, so I think I can truly say that Nicky is falling off slowly but surely.  Raven In My Eye (Cocain Raps Vol. 1) was no joke and had countless tight tracks.  He then followed up that CD with Tears of A Clown which didn't have as many songs as I would have liked, but all of them were quality.  The beats were the sickest he's ever had...and his lyrics were clever and on point as always.  However...as soon as Daiquiri Factory hit...I was a little disappointed.  Some of the songs on the album (Alphabet Soup for instance) had NO business on a professionaly pressed CD.  There were some highlights though...but for the most part, his beats got more and more abstract to the point where I'm not even feeling them anymore.  But now...he comes back with These R the Tales which is by far his most abstract album yet.  Apart from I Saw A Gangsta Cry...I don't think there was a song on the entire album when I didn't say to myself, "I think Dre has finally smoked one chewy too many."  I might even have to sleep on his next album (or cop it online).  Hopefully he will get back to some of the concepts that made him so raw in the past like...Scottie 15, Wack MCs, Smoke Dope and Rap, I'm A Pieces and so many more 
 I'm an American, and I spent a few months living in Japan on my own a few years ago.  I'm going back for a month-long trip soon.  I picked up this book, thinking it would be helpful.  Well, it does have some helpful information that you don't get from the usual Japan guides (such as the difference between uchi and soto), which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star.  My complaint is that the author (P. Sean Bramble) doesn't seem to like Japan very much.  The book is extremely negative about the Japanese.  Yes, every culture has some downsides and Japan is no exception, but I found most of the book to be focused on the negative with very little written on the positive.  I didn't realize it until I was 75% through the book and thought, "Why am I going to this awful place again?"  Then it hit me, what a downer this book has been!  I flipped back through what I had read and was surprised to see how much the author focused solely on negative aspects of Japan.  So the problem is that I don't think he presents a realistic view of Japan and the Japanese culture - by overemphasizing the negative, he doesn't present a balanced view.  For example, after you read the health care section (which says doctors suck and pharmacists are a joke and the dentists are awful), you would think Japan would be the worst place in the world for health care.  That's simply not true - Japanese health care is excellent despite its flaws. Perhaps he was trying to injecting a little reality into the normally too-sunny descriptions of Japanese culture, but he goes too far the other way and in the process loses his ability to describe Japan accurately.  I also question his ability to appreciate the nuances and beauty of Japanese culture -- this quote tells it all:  "When people ask me to explain the real reason I've stayed here all these years, I shrug, scratch my head, and say 'Beer.' 
 OK folks, this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company.  The Art of Shaving products in general are really nice, albeit a tad pricey.  This small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together.  The full sized items will cost you about $75 - $100 total.    The included brush is a "toss away" quality brush.  This is not just my opinion, but a quote from the manager at an Art of Shaving store.  My advice is to get some samples from a department store, then purchase the Art of Shaving shave cream (wow! a great product) here on Amazon, plus either the Tweezerman Badger Brush for $15 or a Best Badger Brush from Crabtree & Evelyn for $35. 
 I was really disappointed with this book.  It was syrup-y sweet and too perfect, as another review said.  I was really looking forward to reading this one after finishing the first one, which was GREAT.  I hope Sisterchicks in Mexico is better! 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
 Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it 
 Notwithstanding the fact that the acing in the movie is actually quite good, the screenplay is so tedious I actually fell asleep in the middle of the afternoon while watching it. A good cure for insomnia 
 As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable 
 This is one of three stepmothering books I purchased, and after reading all three, I can say this book leaves me depressed and hopeless, feeling as though I cannot cope with what stepmothering brings.  The 'real-life' examples and stories seem so negative and worst-case scenario.  This book just encourages feeling negative and hopeless.  It left me full of anxiety and fear, not answers and solutions.  Even though it does offer up many useful suggestions, and illustrates the reality of stepmothering, it errs on the side of the negative extreme.  I'm sure many women can relate to this book, but for those of us who need a positive approach, and have supportive partners and stepchildren who like us, actually love us, we need something else.  I highly recommend "The Courage to be a Stepmom" by Thoele, and "The Stepmom's Guide to Simplifying Your Life" by Goodman.  These two books left me feeling hopeful, I realized the positives and the love, the reasons WHY I'm even bothering with this difficult situation!  I really see the hope and love in my situation after reading those two books, not so for "The Enlightened Stepmother".  Perhaps, the best approach is to read this book first, to make sure you are well aware of the realities of stepmotherhood, THEN read the other two books to learn how to positively face the challenges 
 This is a well-wriiten book by an excellent children's book author. But his reversal of the rainbow makes it unsuitable for young children. I am an early childhood educator and warn that after children see this and make rainbows this wrong way, it will be very difficult to correct them for a some time afterwards 
 Sorry, but this isn't much of a book. Only 160 pages without the index and other stuff in the back, mostly self-promotion by a few architects of their own projects -- ok, some nice hotels and good color pictures in the middle -- only a little technical information.  Other books have much more content, or more pictures of a wider variety of hotels/resorts. Way too expensive for what you get 
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
 Tool is new to me, having been introduced to Laterus in 2005... This new album 10,000 Days is off the chain.  The band is fluid and generates or should I say radiates energy from their music.  It's nice to hear metal played clean, tight and leaving you with wanting to play the album over and over again 
 As a cake decorator of moderate experience - buttercream, fondant, some gumpaste - I have to say this book is not at all helpful. Instruction is either absolutely basic or so poorly illustrated you can't figure it out. All four recipes I tried were failures, though I am a baker of some experience. Dry cakes without flavor, and fillings so rich they were unpalatable. Any of Colette Peters' books are far better for decorating ideas and recipes, and Scott Clark Wooley's "Cakes by Design" has far superior instructions for gumpaste flowers 
 This guy is pathetic and should be ashamed of himself.He was ashamed of his mother,yet thought John's mother could do no wrong.He is a hanger-on,and Im sure all Kennedy family members and true friends are disgusted.Also,did every social interaction revolve around liquor? 
 but so are his critics, especially Reviewer Phantaz Sunlyk (Whitefish, MT United States). I'm not even going to try to explain why because it would take up too much space.  For starters, read the following books: How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God - 0882906070 The Father Is Not the Son - 1890828076  The "Nicene Trinity" is a figment of medieval imagination.  This is historical fact, and the proof is found throughout medieval and world history books and texts.  It's really too well-known to even argue about it, so I won't.  Just read the books.  The author says something about the Trinity no longer being considered obtuse, secondary, and impractical dogma.  NOTHING could be farther from the truth.  Very few Protestant sects believe the Trinity exactly as the medieval bishops were forced to agree to. Even in those days, 1800 bishops signed a statement saying that they did not agree with the Nicene Trinity.  Today, mainly Catholic, and some Protestant sects accept this weakest of Christian doctrines.  The irony is that this doctrine has possibly caused more murder, torture, and mayhem than any other doctrine in any other religion, except Islam.  For nearly two thousand years "Christians" have slaughtered people in the name of the Trinity.  I paraphrase from "The Father Is Not the Son":  We do not find anything like the doctrine of the Trinity in its developed form in the New Testament. If the Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the Bible, then Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach those doctrines.  If Jesus and his apostles did not teach them, then belief in such a doctrine is not mandatory for salvation. If Trinitarian doctrines are not mandatory for salvation, then they cannot be used as a litmus test for membership in the Christian community.  The Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; numerically three persons.  One in purpose. So, stop the persecution, the bigotry, the intolerance, the hate, and the arguing, and try to act like Christians.  
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
  I've really enjoyed the other things that I've read by Franzen (The Corrections; How to Be Alone, a book of essays), but I found "The Twenty Seventh City" to be nearly unreadable. The only reason that I persevered to the end was that I was stuck on a 6-hour cross-country flight with nothing else to read. As it was, I wound up skimming the last 100 pages.   Two of the biggest problems with this book are an overabundance of minor characters and a very choppy narrative, in which the average scence is about 1 to 2 pages. It's just jump after jump after jump for 500 pages, with no sustained development of anything. I also found the basic premise (a police colonel and cousin of Indira Ghandi from India comes to the US to take over the police force of St. Louis, where she uses a band of Indian terrorists to manipulate the city's business and political elite and control the real estate market) so implausible that it was just a constant stumbling block all though the book. None of the characters struck me as remotely believable or interesting. I suppose it was intended as some sort of farce, but I don't think I encountered a single thing that I thought was humorous. Then there is the dialect... rather than developing distinctive characters, the author writes in truly awful dialect (eg, a character who says things like "Habout time" or "Hanyway"; and of course, a police officer with a lisp).   Altogether, this may be most excruciating piece of fiction writing I've read in the last 5 years. 
 EVERYONE HERE DON'T THINK OF BUYING THAT CRAP IT'S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ,PEOPLE WHO GO ON THIS DIET SUFFER FOR LIFE TIME ,I TRIED IT AND I WAS SUFFERING FROM A DISORDER WITH MY EATING HABITS AND I HAVE VISITED LOTS OF DOCTORS TO CURE MY ILLNESS I BECAME SELF OBSESSED AND AND NEVER KNEW ITS RIGHT FOR ME TO EAT OR NOT ....PLEASE DONT TRY THIS BOOK AT ALL RISKS ITS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE ,JUST BE ON A STABLE DIET AND WELL BALANCED MEALS AND U WILL LOSE WEIGHT ,OR TRY SOMETHING LIKE LOW-FAT DIET OR A PROTEIN DIET EVEN WOULD DO 
 I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user 
 Do not read 
 The notoriety of Joe Hill comes not necessarily from the reader impact his debut novel carries but the fact that he is the son of the King of the Horror Genre.   HEART-SHAPED BOX is precisely that: more hoopla than substance.  Unfair as it may sound to compare his work with the best of the earlier tomes of his father, Hill's novel is tired as it is tiring.  Working on a delicious premise of a ghost purchased online, the plot eventually twists and turns only to find out that there is not much but a loose knot to call a story.  What starts out as breath stealing and nerve wrecking pace sputters into a stretched and plodding narrative that depends more on gore rather than providing a real story to sustain interest.  You end up glossing over the pages, hoping that SOMETHING finally happens ... rather than wrestling with verbosity. And when you finally (but finally) reach the very end, what could have been a stunning conclusion merely ends up with an exasperated, "Oh, well."  The father broke ground with CARRIE, the son gives us a gift box with not much inside ... except, well, a dead man's suit 
 This is a deplorable piece of work from a sad, talentless hack. With any luck, this will be last time Nick Hasted is ever asked to write about important figures in music, such as Eminem, whom I love. He simply lacks the skill or flair required to tell the story in a pacy, engaging and believable fashion 
 DARK DESCENT is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding.  Filmed in Czechloslovakia, most of the actors and crew's names end in "v".  Which wouldn't be so bad if they could at least ACT.  Dean Cain, he of Superman fame, bullies his way through the mess, chewing his gum, and wincing after he gets shot in the leg.  Scott Wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits, but the movie never says what happens to him.  The movie starts off with Cain and Wiper (sounds like a law firm, don't it?) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant.  Nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this, but Cain kills them all but one, a nasty guy who plans revenge.  Meanwhile, many of the crew members are committing suicide, and Cain is investigating.  (Excited yet?).  Of course, it all culminates in a kind of underwater HIGH NOON when the bad guy who promised to come back, does so with two other goons, and chase Cain around the plant for a while.  There is nothing exciting about any of this, as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal. Try THE ABYSS or GHOST SHIP or any other undersea film, and you'll do much better than this waste of celluloid 
 This is DFW show-off opus, where he uses verbosity to club the reader over the head until they are senseless and *think* they really understand what he's talking about.  I wonder if this whole work is a cruel joke; to see if we "get it".  This is a book to tackle (and I mean that word) when you're stranded on a desert island with no other choices.  Otherwise pick up one of his collections of non-fiction 
 I was very disappointed with these little chickens.  I wanted them as a party favor for my son's barnyard birthday party.  I didn't realize they are extremely tiny - really only meant for use with the chicken flinger thing -- they should be sold together!  Anyway, I will just use them in a scrapbooking project of for some odd card, so it's not a total loss 
 I bought the white iHome IH6 from Apple along with a 2G Nano. The directions say you must use the proper insert for your iPod and it includes 5 inserts. None of the inserts support the current 2G Nano nor the Mini, Apples best selling model. The directions helpfully suggest that you may _purchase_ inserts for your iPod. What a crock!  I plan to confront iHome and Apple. If they do not give me the inserts for my iPods, I will return the IH6 and move on. Why is buying consumer goods always such a pain 
 Huge pictures, fourteen half-pages of story leaves a young reader with a very vague picture of American history. 
 This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room.  Assembly takes about two minutes.  The instructions are very clear.  The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?  It skips.  Like nobody's business.  At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.  So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.  Save your money!  Buy from someone else 
 I have always used the other well-known office suites in the past but when I received an offer on this suite at a significant discount, I thought I would try it.  I should mention I'm a doctoral student in the middle of a dissertation, so the challenge was to migrate important data and documents into WordPerfect and Quattro Pro.  While I was able to get it done the Quattro Pro interface with SPSS, which had worked seemlessly with the other spreadsheet, failed horribly.  Not to mention the complicated details of what should be simple document formatting--the Visual Basic Editor kept freezing or denying me access.  Invest in a better product if you have serious work.  I've gone back to the benchmark office suite product 
 What a terrible book - not only is it difficult to read - but missing much of common Ecology viewpoints and basics.  Worthless, absolutely worthless - anyone want to by mine - cost of postage. If not, I'll just burn it 
 The size of this item is not diameter, its the length of the handle to the end of the tip on the strainer. the diameter is 3-4 inches. But I guess it would strain rather well 
 I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time.  It was just that bad.  I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it.  It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel.  It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry.  I almost feel dumber for having read this.  Is this really what women RELATE to?  If so, that is so sad?  I found every character in this book just sad.  Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love.  C'mon!  Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown.  F 
 Firstly, I do agree that most people do not get sufficient water during the day.  Drinking more water, and being hydrated, is a good thing and does help with a number of issues.  However, this doctor is saying that water can cure you of a number of diseases that it just won't.    The tone of the book begins as very defensive, with a rebuttle to an article another doctor wrote about this water cure idea.  It goes on for quite a long time, and the defensive posture is echoed throughout the book.  I admit, the author has a lot to be defensive about, as, in my opinion, this book is full of junk science and dubious references.  A classic case of garbage in garbage out.    Drink your 64oz of water a day and feel better.  There, I just saved you the cost of the book, the waste of time reading it and picking through the dross to find the tiny little well-known nugget of gold at the center.    If you are really concerned about your body and making it as healthy as you can, I personally recommend YOU, THE OWNER'S MANUAL by Roizen and OZ as a far better resource.  Not to mention a considerably better read 
 For many years, I have coordinated a study group for human resource individuals taking the PHR/SPHR certification test. I would not recommend this book.  There are statements and questions in the text that do not go into enough depth to be able to study from this book and pass the certification exam.  One example can be found on page 350, question 8, "Which of the following injuries or illnesses is considered work-related?"  Under OSHA you have "reportable" and "recordable" accidents.  The wording in the question is not complete.  Another example is "disparate impact".  The term is defined with two lines of text within the book, however, no examples or details are given on how to determine if there was disparate impact.  I have heard from other certified individuals in our local area who purchased this book and will not use it as a source of study to pass the PHR/SPHR certification exam 
 I am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me, it says that its adujustable, but it can only be made shorter and not longer.  For a kid this is a good jump rope, but its definitely not for a tall person 
 I listen to this CD several times a year.  I gave the book away long ago, but I think I should buy one once a month and give it to someone who needs it.  Lots of people understand this book because they understand the most effective tool left unused is worthless.  Insights, many simple, put into practice will change your life.  This is the gift of these thoughts. DO ONE or TWO and see if you are not changed.  Four circles is my favorite; its easy and always puts a focus on the lifetime that exists within my day.  
 In the last few years rock music biographies have come of age and many are well researched, full of insight and show a real and objective understanding of the artist in question. Victor Bockris' study of one of the most important icons of the 1960's unfortunately falls far short of what I've come to expect.  The book reads like a lazy retread of thirty years of news clippings and has very little insight into what actually made the Stones become the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. He's good at knitting together a constant series of quotes and old interviews into a below average narrative but seems to be unable to actually have any real understanding of the people behind the words.  With less than a quarter of the book dedicated to the years when the Stones actually had some validity and almost half of it dedicated to the incredibly tedious 'heroin' years Bockris misses the whole point of why a book about Keith Richards should be written. One unproductive junkie is just like any other and I don't need nearly two hundred repetitive pages to get the message. As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, the author seems to have an unnatural admiration of Keith's heroin addiction and completely fails to comment on the fact that it neatly coincides with the band's rapid creative decline.   I can only hope that the next four hundred page book on one of popular music's most influential guitar players will have three hundred of them covering the period of 1964 to 1971 with the remainder dealing with the following thirty six years when the Rolling Sones simply ceased to have any relevance 
 I've just started reading Suzanne Brockmann's SEAL books & am jumping around (rather than reading them in order). I really enjoyed her most recent releases but found this novel annoying in its unlikely character interactions, less than sympathetic treatment by the main characters of Mary Lou, & unrealistic racist reversal of said Mary Lou.   You'd think someone in their little tight-knit world of heroes would admire such a YOUNG person who has stayed sober for 18 months, taken on the significant responsibility of child-rearing & trying so hard to fit in. That some sense of compassion would compel the wives & girlfriends (not to mention the husband) to do something other than sneer, etc.   With that said, I found it politically correct but highly unlikely for such a young, screwed-up-life-character like Mary Lou to magically see the light & have mushy feelings for a non-white man - regardless of how nice he was compared to her hero husband, that jerk Sam.  I read the book primarily to move onto the next one & hoped like crazy Mary Lou wasn't going to be killed off. I was definitely not rooting for that loser Sam and his perpetually angry un-girlfriend to connect.   As for Joan & Mike - the potential was there for some interesting stuff but too much energy was expended elsewhere 
 March 17, 2006 Amazon Review  Say it ain't so Joe (Disappointing)  "Chances are you have seen and read a lot of other books, books that promise to give you the 'secrets,' the magic, the inspiration.  You probably know a lot about how to hype yourself by looking in the mirror every morning and repeating certain phrases to yourself... and some other magical-power expressions and attitude builders...But let's face it.  What you want to know is how to sell real products and services now.  And most of those authors never sold much in their lives except their books."  The above quote is from the first page of Joe Girard's book "How to Sell Anything to Anybody".  The impression you get is that Joe is a straight shooter and he's going to tell you about real strategies that will really help you sell, not some touchy-feely self-help garbage, and he comes through.  However, the same cannot be said of "How to Sell Yourself".  Now remember the quip about looking in the mirror, he doesn't explicitly ridicule the practice, but it's implied, and it's almost like a joke between you and Joe where he's saying "Yes that's all fine and good for them, but we know better".  So, imagine my surprise when he advocates in his "How to Sell Yourself Book" that you "Put up a little card where you can see it every day, a card that says I am Number One.  Look in the mirror every morning and tell yourself I am my own best salesperson" (pg. 26).  Say it ain't so Joe.  Tell me you didn't just say that.  Tell me you didn't just suggest such a pathetic and ridiculous thing.  Needless to say, I stopped reading the book right there.  If that's the sort of advice you are looking for then maybe this is the book for you, but I was looking for something that wasn't psycho-babble self-help garbage.  Why did I buy the book then?  Because I read Joe's "How to Sell Anything to Anybody" and was sold on his straight shooting, practical advice.  I thought his next book might have some more interesting or valuable things to say; however, I was disappointed.  It comes across as ungenuine.  The impression is that someone offered Joe a truckload of cash to write another book, and even though he didn't have much else to say after his first book, he agreed and this book is the result.  So, I'd definitely recommend Joe's "How to Sell Anything Book" but I can't recommend this book. 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 This is really not a typical review.   This product (quantity of 3) was not the Screwpull I ordered but received, not once but twice. I had ordered the Screwpull Pocket Model, but apparently there was a error with the online description. I had ordered these in September for 3 Christmas presents and finally gave up when this error could not be  resolved in time. I have been extremely satisfied with the other prodeucts ordered from this site, yet dissapointed that I never got an answer on this in time for Chrismas 
 I purchased this movie because I am a big Audrey Hepburn fan.  I was so disappointed with the movie.  Audrey Hepburn was well past her prime when she made this.  She had lost the spark she had in her younger days.  There is not much of a plot.  Ben Gazarra was terrible.  He just wallked around with a smirk on his face and all the women he knew were supposedly smitten with him.  He was so miscast in that role. He is a short man and not very masculine.  It is hard to imagine women swooning over him.  I regret having wasted my time watching this.  It did have a good soundtrack and John Ritter was funny as a klutz, and Dorothy Stratton was beautiful, but not too believable.  All in all I would not recommend this movie to anyone 
 Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea.  So I was really looking forward to this book.  I have never read a book more disappointing.  The writing is almost impossible to follow.  The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding.  Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person.  I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm.  This book is not worth reading. 
 This book was a huge disappointment.  I know it is supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual for those who chose to remain child-free.  I expected it to provide some form of witty social commentary.  Instead it wallowed around in the tired "aren't babies stinky and dirty" territory instead of providing comic relief.  I was greatly disappointed by the lack of clear, intellectual humor and insight.  
 This is the most boring book I have ever read! I loved the boxcar children books, and all of them I would rate better the 3 stars, but this one was so borring. MYSTERY ranch? What MYSTERY? The was no mystery in this book at all. The whole thing was just so borring. It's the worst boxcar book I have ever read, and I have read about 42 of their so far 87 books! It's just so borring 
 The pictures are glorious; however, the story is extremely disappointing.  There is no real conflict and thus no conflict resolution - which is so important to the little ones.  The rain does, indeed, come down, but that's just about all that happens. Unfortunately, this latest book by Mr. Shannon does not measure up to his wonderfully delightful David series or his great cautionary tale, A Bad Case of Stripes - all of which bring a great big smile to my heart just thinking about them 
 If you read Moral Politics, which I thought was better, you've already read half this book. This is an essay on Freedom attached to the material already covered in Moral Politics.   I found myself saying, "Yes, while I agreed with this the first time, I was hoping for some new content."  When authors like Lakoff repeat themselves from book to book, their arguments become less credible and more rant-like 
 I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an "indoor walk" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout 
 I bought this to support just 3 users in a section of a small branch office that was too cumbersome to hardwire.  Unless you want to blow your credibility as a network admin, don't put this device in your network.   It continually drops connections.  I have the users trained to unplug this thing when it decides to quit working which has been at least twice a week, but now it's every day, sometimes twice.  How embarrassing is that to have your users have to unplug one of you devices because Linksys didn't even have the commonsense to let you reboot it from the web interface??   I've only kept this thing around because I've been waiting for a firmware upgrade.  (Current version is 1 year old at the time of writing)  Can't wait any longer, I'm about to lose my job.  Worst network component ever. 
 This book is so embarrassingly bad that it seems cruel even to review it.  At the same time, I read it almost compulsively in horrified fascination (which is why it deserves one star).  Overwritten, vapid, crammed full of cliches, pricey brand names, infelicitous prose, useless Italian phrases dutifully translated (we get that your Italian is good, but so what?), irrelevant literary references (we also get that you went to Harvard and never got over your good luck at being there), it would be best to forget it and its cast of insufferable characters.  Still, I devoted some time and money to this silly book, so I'll continue.  I understand that this is not, strictly speaking, a memoir, although at times it has the feel of one.  Yet I can't help but feel that the author is striving with every sentence, through the character that she has created, to show the world how intelligent, sophisticated, well read, well traveled, beautiful, sexy, successful, and especially how rich, she, the author, is.  It's as if she's still trying to prove to all those girls who dissed her back in high school or college that she has become "someone."  None of this makes for good or interesting fiction.  As a matter of fact, the only interesting aspect of this book is why a black, sort of, woman would want to transform herself into a rich white Italian woman from Torino.  It's the twenty-first century.  Italy is no longer the ne plus ultra of a chic international life style.  It's so last century, as is our fascination with its outdated and superficial social relations and pretensions to nobility.  Apparently, however, the publisher still buys into all this nonsense and hopes that we will, too 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."  
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 This is a sickingly incipid "book," a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print 
 My 9 year old daughter is very athletic and excells at all sports but these things are difficult to master.  Very large danger of ankle and leg injuries from falling and twisting the ankle.  Maybe it depends on the body type of the kid; mine is tall and thin, built for speed not strength.  Maybe a stronger kid could do it.  These are going back 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 I am an avid reader of Ragnar Benson's books.I found most of his books very practical and useful for emergency situations. Un fortunately, this is not one of those books. I expected the book to be more practical in the sense that plants and other items found in the woods and local environment would be addressed as part of the concepts presented. This book is too impractical for my learning needs. Although this book is not up to par for me, I do recommend that readers explore some of the authors other works 
 This is an outdated, very limited documentary on Bluegrass, with a few interviews, most of them looking like they were done in the 1970s. There are huge gaps in this "story of Bluegrass music" -- if you know anything at all about the history, you will be shocked at what is left out. It's not even a good introduction, nor a good general overview, to Bluegrass. I saw a MUCH better documentary on CMT's bluegrass week back in January 2002. What a dissappointment this DVD is! 
 This by my account is one of the worst debacles in Reba McEntire's career.  These song would be better fitting for Kelly Clarkson or Britney Spears or Paula Abdul rejects from the eighties.  WIth titles like "Up and Flying" and "Invisible" what can you expect?  Certainly not good old three chord, hard core steel and fiddle country.  Its a shame that such a talent as Reba's should be wasted on such banal tripe as this.  
 I'm usually a big linksys supporter. This is an exception. This device is a joke. Not a very funny one. The first thing I was told when I called for support was it most likely wouldn't work with my printer (Canon MP950). I spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support. Don't waste your time 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 This book takes the position that increasing technological infrastructure and investing in higher information technology does not increase productivity. The argument is complete hokum from beginning to end; however, it is very convincing due to the large amount of evidence presented and the prestige of the pseudoscientist promulgating it.   Most of the evidence presented exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which should be obvious to any logician or scientist reading it. However, several more subtle fallacies are also present. The subtlety comes in by virtue of the author failing to define `productivity.'  First, the author measures productivity using GDP. This is analogous to using the physics definition of work when you ask a man who's spent all day trying to tip over a mountain, "Why are you so tired? The mountain hasn't moved, therefore you haven't done any work!" GDP is a measure of output in terms of dollars. It does not measure work done, just how much was sold.   Second, the author uses return on assets to analyze investments in new equipment. Now, I'm no expert in finance, but since assets is in the denominator, using ROA in the way this author does (the ROA of the firm, not the investment decision) would systematically understate the positive effects of these investments. Net Present Value or Internal Rate of Return would both be much better measures.  Third, and this is related to the second point, the author compares firms to what they were in the past (before investing in technology) or to other, dissimilar firms. The relevant comparison is between a firm's current profitability and what the current profitability would have been if not for the investment. The common form of this reasoning is: XYZ Corp. made a huge technological investment in 1986, and experienced no rise in productivity (as measured by ROA). This ignores the possibility that the whole industry became more competitive, and failing to invest in the technology could have led to bankruptcy.   In a related issue, he completely ignores rising standards. His argument is equivalent to, Finding Nemo did not make significantly more money than The Lion King. Therefore, enhanced technology did not increase productivity. This is incorrect because productivity is a measure of work done over time, not money made. If animators tried to make a film with the graphics quality of Finding Nemo by hand, it would have taken several orders of magnitude longer, if it was even possible! The fact is, the animators, like so many workers in society, get far more done today than they used to, they just don't get paid anymore to do it, which is actually an argument for the value of technology.  I gave up on it shortly thereafter 
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 This is a rehash of Charles Tart, Wayne Dyer, and a host of others. Nothing at all new.  What is new is that someone can put out something the length of an article and call it a book.  And charge for the price of a book.  Just for the heck of it I let a friend read it, who hasn't read this stuff before and NO it did not turn her world inside out.  If you have never heard this stuff before it  is way to short to convince you.  If you have read it before, no need to read it again.  Many other people have said it better 
 I liked most of Cook's books. This one I skipped to the last pages having waded through 3/4 of it. I think there MUST be a way of getting a novel along other than the "I am a maverick doctor/lawyer/cop/engineer that will investigate this case to the end even if my bosses tell me it is closed because I am so emotionally involved with every single case that I cannot rest till I see it closed as I think it should". Then this guy JUST happens to be told about rats dying. And he JUST happens to get another case of the same type. And then (and this is simply so incredible that it is funny) he has this girl he is totally hot for in a romantic dinner together and they start talking about anthrax and botulism cases and then they go together to his house to...nononoo sorry, they both go off together (after desert of course) to talk to the husband of one of the victims to tell him to be careful with botulism!!! At night!!! In a loaned car!!! I mean, one cannot trust the agencies with that, no? And who can think about s*x when one is worried about botulism? Of course the husband is the russian bad guy. Add so many cliches about white trash and hip minorities you could sink a battleship, and you have this novel. Forget it. Read "Coma" instead, this book could induce you to a coma 
 Description or product is wrong.  There is no quad independent power/charging indicators.  They are set up in banks of two.  One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two.  Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable.  Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger 
 Was sent this book by a friend who thought the subject was sad and depressing.  I was disappointed in this book.  I read the first reviews out, and thought it would be a good story and a good read.  I was the one sad and depressed reading this story because of a shallow plot, predictable story, and underdeveloped characterzation.  Maile Meloy has more talent then this book tells.  
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 not as good as the 1st three but you need it to go with the other 4 deathwish films 
 I've read the book.  One look at the "testimonial" pictures in the back and you'll know this is worse than a rip-off.  Because she is intructing you to go thru a laborious, time-consuming process. And even her own customer's before and after pics are a joke 
 This is a terrible book. I am a total novice in FrontPage and web page creation but have lots of experience in computers including programming years ago.   Usually I am the one everyone asks questions of with computers. I was unable find the Button she talked about on the 3rd page. I searched everywhere for it and asked Microsoft and HELP and still haven't found it.  She assumes you know where things are but we DON'T.  very frustrating experience 
 Usually my favorite book is the one I'm reading at the time.  However, Gardenias for Breakfast is my All Time Favorite Book EVER!!  I have given several copies for gifts and have shared my copy numerous times.  I think if you were a Mother of girls, you would especially relate to this book.  I do not have daughters, but, I am a daughter and I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Robin Jones Gunn is just a fantastic painter of word pictures and she shines in this book 
 The conversations and actions of the characters were totally unbelievable. I had to force myself to finish the book 
 I don't like BTWN at all. It's got lots of covers, and apart from "Jump they say" and "I know it's gonna happen some day", all songs sound the same. They're even of the same length. They just don't build up to something. They lack some sort of climax. I find it very hard to sit through the whole album. And all the extra's you get with this expanded edition just make things worse; more boredom is what they bring 
 Not happy ! I wanted to rate this item with zero star, if the system allowed me. 
 Bought this book because there was a good feedback. But when I tried 3 times of 2 recipes and it didn't work, I gladly exchanged for something else. Wrong measurements were given which resulted in me wasting my expensive cocoa ingredients. Waste of time and money 
 I would imagine it was the cheap, crummy power supply, but mine wouldn't even light up...dead...One wonders why a $200 component can't run on 110 volts?  I'd try it again if they re-worked the power supply, but not if I have to use a DC adapter like a $3 item. 
 I purchased video for my 14 month old and was really disappointed by this video. First, it claimed to tell the story of Noah's Ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about Noah.  My daughter watched the video half-way though (which is not so bad) but in general, prefers Baby Noah by Baby Einstein and Noah's Ark by Baby Miracle. While the video has a few pretty images, I do not recommend it. Hope my review is helpful.  
 I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.  Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.  If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms 
 As other reviewers have noted, this book is not exactly what you may be expecting.  Don't expect to see concrete suggestions on how to clear clutter, or perhaps ways of staying organized.  This book is really a strange new age religious book.  It will briefly touch upon reality, such as: junk in a corner will distract us when we walk into a room.  Yes, this makes sense.  Or perhaps that cleaning up clutter will improve your mood in your home.  This also makes sense.  However, then we enter "Crazy Karen" land.  Karen can smell the taint of clutter when she enters a house.  In fact, she can tell if your house is cluttered by smelling you.  Yes, outside of your home, she can sense the clutter.  That is how in-tune she is with the spirit world.  Instead of just cleaning up the clutter, you probably should get out some sacred candles, walk the mystic circle 4 times, and use a special clutter clearing chant to get rid of the negative vibes which will cause clutter to appear.  Over all, I don't think the chants are necessary to clean a house, nor that mystical spirits are causing me to drop my clothes in a pile near my closet.  It just happens.  In either case, if you believe her, or think she's a nutcase, I still think the book won't be all that inspiring.  It very rarely touches on concrete suggestions, and then moves onto the next topic without giving you a real answer.  It is a "feel good" book, but not one which should be relied upon to help you solve a problem 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 P. Erlich is one of the members of the league of the profets of disgrace, people that earn money (in general, a lot of money) by telling that this and that catastrophe is going to happen. His favourite one is "overpopulation". That myth is more than  dead and, in fact, people are beggining to be concern about quite the opposite, underpopulation. Read instead the great "The Ultimate Resource 2" by Julian Simon 
 I purchased 2 Rite Lites to use under my kitchen cabinets.  The light output was not strong enough to assist in food prep or even read a recipe. Additionally, the batteries were drained very quickly so I would have to be replacing batteries all the time.  I called the company to see if I could return them and was told no if I didn't have the original packaging -- even though I had the invoice.  I was very disappointed to have $32.00 worth of merchandise that I couldn't use or return 
 I am astounded by the highly positive reviews of this book.  The best reviews came from people who believe they have shared the abduction experience and are anxious to praise a product that confirms their own experiences, as they believe them to be.  This book is poorly written.  There are major logical flaws in the narrative (for instance, how many houses sit so flat upon the ground that a footprint (just one single footprint) could possibly be visible both on the carpet and the flowerbed?  What about the width of  the walls, for Heaven's sake? What about foundations and sills and 2 X 4's?) I am a marriage and family therapist and I found nothing believable about Mr. Spark's descriptions of his interactions with his wife. Her character had all the depth of character of a Stepford Wife.   I really believe that part  must have been added to give the story a little extra drama; it was badly done. I will not be purchasing the sequel that he promises to his readers in the last part of the book. And,  I'm sorry; I wanted to like this book.    
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 This book was a classic, but why does it have to be metric?  I guess converting it gave the academics something to do.  Here is a news flash for the publisher: Civil Engineers praticing in the US don't use the metric system.  Even our state DOT has given up on converting.  I wish that the 6th edition was still available.  Its just about useless now 
 As a Christian with Jewish friends, I read the book hoping to learn more about the "life-centered" aspects of Judaism.  The title drew me in. However, I found the book very offensive to Christians. Granted, the rabbi is writing about Judaism, but the "slams" against Christianity--as others have put it so well--have no place in the book.  Kushner admits that some Jews believe this, others believe that, but his attitude seems to be that all Jews are very observant. I gather that Judaism is based on actions and, the rabbi thinks, that Christianity is based on faith alone. Devout Christians pray morning, noon, night and compline; read devotional texts based on scripture--both Hebrew Bible and New Testament; read special materials during the long period of repentance and reflecton we call Lent--not just a week or 10 days, but 40 days not counting Sundays; although we must repent each day and pray for forgiveness, and certainly do so each week in church, Lent calls us to 40 days of prayer, fasting and other disciplines--but it isn't supposed to be on display.  Jesus opposed that;  we hold a three-hour vigil on Passion Friday; say grace before meals and sometimes after. Our religion stresses the need to repent our sins, ask God for forgiveness (no "pagan" elements, thank you, Rabbi; just the One God). Do good works, be charitable. We have two to seven sacraments, dependng on the church, and many Holy Days, of which Easter is the holiest.  Much of what Jesus taught is very similar to what Hillel and others taught. Kushner says Christians need Jews to remind us that there is more to religion than faith (something like that). We get it. And that Jews need Christians to remind them to share what is so great about Judaism ... except that if Judaism had spread widely, he said, it wouldn't be Judaism because it's a "community" as much as a religion ... an ethnic group.  OK.  I went into the book very open-minded, receptive even, looking for the "life," the joy I hear there is supposed to be in Judaism.  Telling me that I was born a pagan, that I'm still part pagan because Christianity is part pagan, and slamming Christianity throughout the book, made me angry. 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 This may be "how Mexico really is," but its not a good movie. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting much more. But like 21 Grams, it is just a movie about people you don't really care about because you don't get to know them well enough. You feel like a voyeur on other people's miserable lives and you never get inside their heads enough to really care. Its like watching a sit com, just splashed all over a big screen. There is too much violence without a point. The acting is good but the stories are blah, especially the middle one, and the themes are not developed very well. Its too much "film-making" without anough story. The style doesn't hook into the story and there is very little emotion generated. I simply didn't care, and I would never want to see it again.  Y tu mama tambien is much, much better. 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 Be careful ! Do not buy illegal copies from Asia ! always verify that the label is Square or Sony or Universal or anything you know. Label Japanese import are illegal copies. Always wonder when there are a low price and a high price. Most of the time he higher price is the legal copy ! Please don't kill the music you love  
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 I would like to thank Joan Peters for confirming that concocting a fraud is still an American tradition.  The fallacious arguments presented in Peters thesis are discredited by her active participation in commiting a fraud.  For anyone really interested in the facts about this book and the Israel-Palestine conflict I highly recommend Norman Finkelstein's book, Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict.  Supporters of Joan Peters are simply supporting the disinformation that has lead to the unbalanced opinion of the US today.  The rest of the world recognizes this piece of literature as a fraud.  Please take the time to look at the evidence for yourself at www.normanfinkelstein.com  
 I have had this sweeper for several months and like others, it's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor, laundry room, and basement floors clean. Well, it does pick up larger debris best, but when you go for picking up hair, dust and dirt, it blows a lot of it around, not to mention, I noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes COVERED in dust. Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to "suck" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to "clean" your floors, you will be quite disappointed. In fact I only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it doesn't get tracked in my upstairs 
 this book was nowhere near as good as gail's other books, but if you read this and dont like it, dont give up on her yet!!! ella enchanted was so good, i have rad it eight times, the princess tales are great for bedtime, and the two princesses of bammare is also amazing. i have not read her later books for younger childeren though, because they do not look as good. soon a new book called fairest is coming, so i hope she is getting back to her old ways. if you are a fan of gails better books, then i suggest you try reading shannon hales books 
 If she had a genuine interest in translating the Tao Te Ching one would think that Ursula LeGuin would have learned Chinese and studied the Tao Te Ching in depth.  She has done neither, and the "translation" shows this, making some very horrible distortions of the original text that are indeed well written, but have nothing to do with Taoism 
   To begin with humans, as a species, are not very variable genetically. Of this small genetic variation, only a small proportion is correlated with the geographical distribution of human social groups. This geographically conditioned genetic variation, small though it is, can nevertheless help in the reconstruction of human history as long as it is used to supplement large amounts of reliable information from the social sciences: social and cultural anthropology, history, archeology, and linguistics.   One thing that geographically conditioned genetic variation cannot help with is in explaining the evolution of cultural and social institutions within human groups. Social scientists discovered this a century ago when they observed that genetically very similar groups can show enormous cultural and social differences while groups that are relatively different genetically can be socially and culturally alike. Unfortunately, the authors of this book are not aware of this. As geneticists who know little social science they look for genetic explanations where these do not exist.  The author's ignorance of social science also leads them to miss an important story. Although, the genetic differences between human groups are relatively insignificant in themselves, humans have, at times, attached a great deal of importance to them. One product of this socially and culturally conditioned exaggeration of the importance of genetic differences has been racism. Unfortunately, the author's ignorance of social science seems to have rendered them unconscious of their own racial prejudices.   Readers interested in human diversity can find a number of good books on this subject. This is not one of them 
 I couldn'get get past the first thirty pages. The idea was neat, but the begining drags on and on. As well it seem more like a treatise on why punk sucks now and the author knows why and is waaaay cooler. Snoresville 
 This story starts out immersing the reader in a Klingon battle game, the rules of which are never clear. This opening only really serves to introduce the main characters of the book and is otherwise confusing and completely unnecessary. I almost put the book down because this section was so uninteresting. But it does pick up somewhat from there, when we follow Vrenn's life and his rise from humble beginnings to command a ship of his own. There are some interesting dynamics between the characters but as usual when dealing with Klingons, you're never quite sure who can be trusted or who will ultimately betray whom.  Nearly every bit of Klingon lore and culture introduced in this book has been contradicted by the "official" canon of later TV shows and movies, so it's not even really good as a peek in the Klingon way of life. Bottom line - unless you are passionately interested in all things Klingon, I would pass this book by 
 I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.   
 This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 This book is little more than a meandering list of obtuse, random literary references on the word "Manliness". I must admit that after the first couple of chapters I could not force myself to press on and read the whole thing. It is as boring as reading a train schedule.  I did skim the book to see if the rest of it follows the same pattern of random references with no interpretation. It does.  I did read the final chapter to see if the book comes to any conclusions. It does not.  The idea for the book is interesting, but the book itself is full of padding and fill 
 No new material, just a recap of things already seen.  A complete waste of money.  Interestingly, the description on the back was exactly the same as vol.2 .  Maybe they were trying to send a warning.  If you can find a way to get your money back, do so 
 We hoped this would be a fun, stimulating toy for our then 10 month old.  Christmas morning came, we tried it, and the touch-screen buttons didn't work. Received a new one and the buttons worked but only if you pressed very hard on one particular spot.  Also, there is not a lot going on, gets boring and redundant very fast 
 I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift and was very disappointed. The receipies call for 2 or 3 different types of flour and many replace fat with apple sauce. I was looking for basic muffins with a number of flavor ideas. This isn't it. 
 I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.   Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to be reiterated.  A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  I was looking for more than that.  The advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process. There is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  An example is always attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent "needs to be needed".  Some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  False assumptions leads to false conclusions.   I gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  But it isn't helping my family.  
 While the magazine itself is a great magazine (very informative)you can buy it through the cards that come in the magazine for far less money. Don't get ripped off. Buy it through the magazine 
 I appreciate and like Johnny Lang's music.  There is no doubt that he is amazing.  However, this CD is awful.  It does not demonstrate his true abilites and should have the "kid" still in the title.  The CD is good if you want to complete your collection, but this CD is not one worth listening to twice.  Save your money and wait for his next CD release 
 This book's author is one of an ilk that cannot abide to leave the stories of other religions than her own unscathed by her yen for monotheism.  The Preface of the book, rather than simply forwarding the myths in their entirety, sets the stage for euhemerization of the Norse stories to fit her own need for bland orthodoxy.  And the final myth of the book is hideously rendered to completely alter the cosmogeny of the Norse pantheon, again to suit her own weak religious predisposition.  This is akin to changing all of the Old testament stories by, say, removing any references to rape and murder simply to white-wash those books to suit modern, enlightened sensibilities.    If an author proposed to write on the myths of still-extant religious practices, then the least that author can do is present them unedited and unsullied, clear in their original form and intent.  This book's author is unable to see her way past her own religious indoctrinations, and so ruins otherwise lovely stories with her poisoned pen.  A far better story book of the Norse myths to be read for children is "The Children of Odin", by Padraic Colum, and illustrated by Willy Pogany.  
 Yes, my review is one star, only because Amazon doesn't have zero.  This is the type of book you would expect from some internet self-publishing site.  The fact that St. Martins Press greenlighted this project casts serious doubt on their judgment.  The factual errors are mind-boggling.  Sorry, Ken, Hans Conreid did NOT narrate Fractured Fairy Tales on Bullwinkle.  Actors Gaillard Sartain and Richard Moll are NOT dead as of this writing (August 2005), so they were probably alive in 2004 when you wrote this book as well.  Actress Jane Curtin does not spell her last name as in the "curtain" you hang from a rod.  Johnny Carson did NOT do the Tonight Show for 31 years (it was 29 and a half).  Jack Benny's famous reply to "Your money or your life!" was "I'm thinking, I'm thinking!"...not "I'm thinking it over."  Michael McKean did NOT participate in Spinal Tap before Laverne & Shirley.  You only missed that one by a decade.  Batman did NOT premiere on ABC in 1964.  You're getting closer, it was 1966.  The word "forgotten" is spelled with an "e" at the end; not an "o."  The detective on Miami Vice was Tubbs; not Stubbs.  And is an "informercial" the same thing as an infomercial?  These are factual and grammatical errors I found by reading perhaps HALF the book.  It is categorized  by stupid "love-hate categories, so it's easy to skip over shows or genres you don't care about.  But I now know that Mr. Tucker, who somehow manages occasional employment by respectable magazines, LOVES Ricky Nelson, "Full House," Aaron Spelling, Simon Cowell, Richard Hatch, "Silk Stalkings," Lisa Bonet, and "Welcome Back Kotter," but HATES "M*A*S*H," Johnny Carson, "The Price Is Right," "Mystery Science Theater," "Family Guy,"  and PBS.  Talk about being out of touch with the reading public.  He bounces all over the place, flinging his mindless meanderings toward the wall, but in the end, nothing sticks.    This book adds nothing to anyone's perspective of TV.  There's no depth, or new information here.  Apparently Mr. Tucker spent a couple weeks spewing out a like/dislike list, and a gullible publisher sent this one to press without editing, fact-checking, or apparently any regard to buyer appeal.  I get the feeling someone got called on the carpet for this one.  It's inexcusable 
 As a die-hard Rick Springfield fan from the 80's I was eager to get this album. The songs are well done and the music is very nice, but Rick's voice sounds like he's smoked WAY too much for way too long. A little rapsy is one thing, but this album sounds like he was choking the whole time. I'm sorry I bought it and am thinking of reselling it. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD without being annoyed at the crackle of his voice. It almost doesn't even sound like him. Sorry, Rick. 
 ive read dozens of reviews for this book.  the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place.  they are all FALSE! this book is BORING.  i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series.  other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category.  ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far.  the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to "make it rain" or "make the statues talk". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman.  this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish.  for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended.  i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish.  its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair.  if you want real fantasy, try something else. please. 
 This is not a great book - pure and simple.  The author is chaotic in his exposition of the subject and time after time tries to come up with his own reinterpretation of the key concepts of Buddhism - apparently, in an attempt to look original.  Not recommended.  
 I just bought this CD after reading Nevermore was spawned by the band Sanctuary which I used to like a lot. However I find Nevermore quite a bit more thrashy and not very original. I like Warrel Dane's voice and lyrics but they are somewhat covered up by the instruments and many of the songs are just kind of boring. I havn't heard any other Nevermore CDs but at this point I would have to say Sanctuary was a much better band. At least they could write a decent melody. 
 Bill O'Reilly is a dinosaur that just doesn't get it.  In this book he shows how he hates American Gen X & Y culture.  Its time to move on Bill, you are a dieing bread.  American culture is about diversity and variety, it is always changing, too bad his closed mind can't handle that.  The culture war is really close minded vs. open minded people.  This wasn't a very good book 
 This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.  The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.  The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.  Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.  Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.  Very few pictures and all for the rich.  I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.  Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.  
 JIll gave me her recipies for Prime rib,Yorkshire puddin, mushrooms, brussles spurouts, Pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home.  I gotta get her book before it is too late 
 Extraordinary book! Mr. Belknap really cuts to the core of the issues surrounding the My Lai incident and the subsequent Courts Martials (Calley being the only person actually found guilty). His review of the political issues of the era as well as the personal sacrifice made by the prosecution, really help the reader understand what happened after Lt. Calley returned to the United States. Anyone interested in military justice, or who may remeber the incident and not understand fully what was involved, should pick up a copy 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 "Is it really my failure, or theirs?"  Carol Kennicott asks herself this question nearly 250 pages into "Main Street," regarding her impossible relations with the residents of  the town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. By this time, I was asking a similar question: "Is it really my failure, or Sinclair Lewis's?"  "Main Street" seemed a good idea as it sat on my shelf. Touted as a satirical look at middle-class America, it was Lewis's first successful novel, ushering in a new era upon its publication in 1920, and breaking critical ground for the Golden Age of American Literature, of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner. Lewis was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. How could I go wrong picking it up?  The book tells the interminable story of Mrs. Kennicott, who marries a country doctor while imagining herself an improving influence on his as-yet-unseen town of Gopher Prairie. Imagine her surprise when she is greeted not as a liberator but grist for the gossip mill, with her Big City ideas and lack of churchiness.  Carol's alternating turns of resistance and acceptance are about the sum total of this plotless book. Lewis's descriptive powers are much in evidence, and you find yourself trapped in G.P. as much as Carol, his descriptions of noisy neighbors and smug dinner parties bearing the unmistakable imprint of someone who grew up in small-town Minnesota and knew of what he wrote. The problem, when you get past the period slang and the barbed commentary, is that the subjects of Lewis's satire are so miserable and nasty you can't understand why Carol thinks she can change them, except perhaps with the idea nature couldn't possibly create people as one-dimensional as those found here.  I thought I'd never read a duller work about small-town Americana from the early 20th century than Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." My apologies, Thornton. "Main Street" is as down on the same locale that "Our Town" exults, only Lewis lays on derision with a dripping trowel. Wilder, by contrast, seems almost surgical in the delicacy with which he makes his points. Lewis makes sure that when he presents us with the atheistic radical Miles Bjornstam, he is not only a voice of reason and affability to Carol but ultimately run out of town for his beliefs on the heels of having suffered a great tragedy, just in case we didn't otherwise get how miserable a town Carol is stuck in.  "And you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap?" Carol fumes early on.  There is one effective section in the book, when Carol first discovers how isolated she has become and feels the "moist, fleering eyes" of prying neighbors so powerfully she draws down her window shades. Passages with her husband, the stolid, straying, but not worthless Dr. Kennicott, present some desperately-needed ambiguity.  But the book just keeps going, hammering home the same points, before winding down with an ending that feels more like a cop-out, in which the still-radical but more placid Carol settles for the status quo while imagining her sleeping infant daughter as "a bomb to blow up smugness." Polemics can produce great writing, but seldom great literature, and "Main Street" is a case in point.  The Signet Classic edition from 1998 features an introduction by Thomas Mallon which was the most enjoyable part of the book, candidly pointing out the book's faults but arguing for its continued value, as it imagines Carol's experience being like that of a young Hillary Rodham first arriving in Little Rock. Suffice to say I had a lot more fun reading it than I did the rest of this book 
 ok i hate disney and than they come out with this craptastic piece of crap?! 
 Peter was a fair book. I enjoyed reading Peter, however the ending was not satisfying. As I have learned over the years from reading many books, you cannot decide how the book ends. This may seem strange, however, I was disappointed by the ending. Peter was not particularly my taste: a funny, suspenseful book with a firm closing ending. Rather, it is a real-life book teaching a lesson. Whether or not you pick this book is up to you, but if you are looking for a good book to read and found this book by picking at random, or it looked interesting, I recommend that you continue your search. I rate Peter with 2 to 3 stars 
 Alan Deutschman writes in quintessential GQ style...Apple, Pixar, Next and Jobs are given the cinematic attention - Brioni suits and designer clothing take precedence to the story telling theme! That's precisely where the story ends - Neither Apple's business environment nor the facts behind Jobs renaissance garner attention! Steve's vendetta against the Apple board that sacked him, his bitterness about moving away from the company he helped create and his pre-occupation with Odwalla fruit juices/Black polo shirt & blue jeans are the only facets of Steve's character that Deutschman manages to grasp. (...) Steve's obsession with German design aesthetics, his "tomfoolery" with his corporate hobbies- Next, Pixar and Apple are all touted by Deuschman as tenets of a precipitous corporate personality! Jobs is portayed as a whip slashing mogul who just rides his "ill-deserved" luck to the top- He is credited with ZERO intelligence and a disgusting atttitude! Apparently, Next and Pixar had no strategies and were "bleeding,hemorrhaging corporations"- a phrase Deutschman uses with irritating regularity!  Job's groundbreaking strategies to rev up the motorcade of new products at Apple and Next are promptly thrown out of the window! His ability to turn small-door companies like Pixar into money making machines is rudely ignored. (...)This man hardly knows what he is talking about 
 The Internet doesn't allow one to write faster; it simply sends the message faster. It is another stage in the development of commerce, not a new medium of communication. Opportunists are so happy to have something new to perch on, but beware: you've got to entertain to get away with making a living making something out of nothing. This doesn't 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.   Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.  I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution 
 I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this! 
 Color is such an important element in Mr. Scharf's work that it's difficult to believe this monograph was published without it.  There is not a single color photograph aside from the cover.  And the book is so tiny [Dimensions (in inches): 0.26 x 7.85 x 5.28]  that color photographs wouldn't do Mr. Scharf's work justice anyway.  I recommend that interested parties try to find a copy of one of his out-of-print books at their local library.  Mr. Scharf's work is amazing, and well worth viewing in full color, as he intended it to be viewed 
 This is not a review of this item, but the whole series.  Not only are the films in this bundle not all musicals, this bundle is sent intstead of the purchased bundle.  Until Amazon straightens out the mess in titles, forget ordering Alice Faye and Betty Grable bundles:  Particularly MARQUEE MUSICALS. 
 This book is not LaVey's best. The best thing about it is the humour that LaVey manages to weave into his writing -- at times it can get a bit childish, but at it's best, the irreverance can be quite amusing.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really reddem the book, as it seems quite obvious  that he has nothing to say here. LaVey seems much bitterer and full of  himself in a rather narcissistic way than he was earlier in his life and  this lack of perspective makes him seem sort of absurd. In this collection  of essays, LaVey is indulging himself -- but it is largely the indulgence  of a two year old throwing a temper tantrum rather than the indulgence of  the artist, which was the ideal that he had in mind when he wrote the  Satanic Bible. There are essays about playing dumb jokes on people, on how  much he hates everyone, and so on. But there are some gems here. His  aphorisms are worse than useless, but ideas of the "Law of the  Trapezoid" are interesting, as are his sharing of his musical tastes  with everyone (and rather good taste it is!). He shares his interest of the  odd and unusual, inlcuding several little-known but interesting people and  the rip-roaring humour of "Hatha Toilet Seat meditation". Still,  these little snippets are not quite enough to redeem this volume and the  foreward by Kenneth Anger certainly adds nothing to the book (he mentions  that lamentable fact that the popular media had chosen to ignore LaVey --  but does not mention that LaVey has plagiarised so much of his  "work" that he has got basically what he deserved). The sheet  music for the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" is included, as well  as various original musings which really aren't worth anyone's time except  for the most enthusiastic LaVey worshipper. If your library has it, it  might be worth a read, but it's not worth the price. If you want laVey at  the height of his powers, check out the Satanic Bible; this is just the  rantings of a bitter old man 
 "To trick the eye"  if that is your intention be objective ... this people do not" fool the eye"... they fool themselves, and you 
 It is a shame that the vesion is cropped not widescreen !!!The poetry of the movie is destroyed! 
 In spite of trying, I could not complete the 'Bitter Fruit'!   This is a story of a black middle-class family in post-apartheid South Africa. After years of struggle and deprivation they now enjoy material comforts, but events from the brutal past give them no peace of mind. The story of Silas family’s struggles to come to terms with the past, even as prosperity and equality beckons, is used as a metaphor for the dilemma in present-day South Africa.  While the Truth and Reconciliation Committee works to heal the society from the indignities of the apartheid-era, individuals must still confront their demons from the past in private.   In this story, Silas and his wife see their lives turned upside-down when he runs into a white policeman who raped her a long time ago. It is fertile territory for Mr. Dargor with his social activist background, but the result falls short 
 Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...  Don't waste your money   
 In this day and age, how can anyone take this book seriously?  To rate hitters by batting average is simply a waste of effort because on-base percentage and slugging percentage correlate far better with scoring runs  and winning games than batting average 
 This book doesn't come close to being true to it's title. Simple? I think not. The "patterns" are more on the confusing side of things, and as one reviewer mentioned, seemed to be more like guidelines rather than actual patterns. There were only two projects in the whole book that even appealed to me; the aran armchair cover and the flower trimmed evening bag. If you have a more ecclectic flair you might find this book to your liking. The pictures in the book also tend to show a close up view of the project without showing you what the whole project looks like completed. I would recommend checking it out from the library first and to leaf through to see if it is your kind of book, otherwise you might end up just as disappointed as me 
 This plane was useless.  It crashed on it's first flight, and broke.  We never could get it to fly right, and it quickly was smashed to pieces.  Don't waste money on this plane 
 I enjoyed the first part of this CD but it left me flat when it went into Hindu gods.  Don't get me wrong--if you can believe that wtuff feel free but as a Christian I don't plan to flirt with breaking the first commandant.  I thought the CD would be more in line with Buddhism.  Buddha, as I understand it, did not believe in God, per se, but he was a very admirable person and did a lot of good for the human race.  I am also a great admirer of the Dalai Lama.  I did give this CD to a nurse who is a Buddhist and she enjoyed it.  I also like Deepak Chopra and wouldn't I love to have his money 
 This book concluded that the examined weaknesses of the Contras  would lead to defeat.  This turned out to be incorrect, since  Contra activity was one of the reasons why Sandinistas were replaced by elections, and a shaky but real democracy.   Such evaluations are common in war for those participating in conflicts tend believe that their enemies are more competent than they really are.  However, there is useful information in this book. 
 The reviewer below who said "More Heat Than Light" got it partly right.  This book is SO badly written you have to wonder if the author's other works were written by the same person. Not only is it sophomoric, it is gibberish.  Had its author been unknown, she would surely have had to pay for the book's publication. Incredibly bad, it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers 
 If you don't know much more about Woodrow Wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. There's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. Maybe Woodrow Wilson's life is just too large for a book this small 
 Where are all the stars coming from?  I bought this book, and I was highly dissapointed.  I was looking for useful information on diet, light therapy, vitamins, etc. that would actually help you survive the real winter blues - seasonal attitude diplacement disorder.  This book was written for someone who doesn't have a life and needs to be told stupid little things to do to keep from being bored.  All you 5 star people - get a life!  P.S. If you look real hard you might find vitamin info in a one liner somewhere in this book.  Otherwise it's mostly nonsense 
 This book is a disappointment. Kids may get a laugh out of it, but they won't learn anything about eating well.  I hesitate to give it to any of my grandchildren 
 Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern "superstars". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, "Words Get in the Way". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of "Conga" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS 
 I bought this set because of the colors and the value. It looked beautiful and smelled wonderful but that's where the &quot;nice things&quot; ended. I lit all the candles and within 1 1/2 hours it was ruined. They all dripped down onto the next and either snuffed out the flame or the melted wax dripped all over the rocks in the tray. The wax is of poor quality. If you never light these, they're fine but once you light them be cautious of dripping wax. 
 The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.  The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.   So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too 
 Aslam's core story is fascinating - a culture clash that leads to the deaths of three people, and the collapse of a family. However, I found the book difficult to read for two reasons. The first was the visceral hatred thrown up on nearly every page towards Islam and the beliefs and attitudes held by first-generation Pakistani immigrants. Some of these beliefs are indefensible (such as honour killings and the fatal exorcism that appears in a subplot) but Aslam's seeming hatred of this culture - one he grew up in; he's the son of a Pakistani political exile - and Islam poisons any argument he was trying to make and makes this book a piece of anti-Islam and anti-Pakistani propaganda. The second difficulty with this book comes from Aslam's incredibly pretentious prose style (such as describing segments of an orange on a plate as "dolphins leaping over ocean waves"). Linked in with this is his failed stab at introducing magical realism (men with glowing hands and blood, peacocks and parakeets, fireflies becoming ghosts, men with golden hair), into the mix. The story that Aslam is trying to tell is the only reason why I have given this book two stars. If that hadn't been interesting, it would have just managed one. The difficulties Pakistani immigrants are facing in the UK, and elsewhere in the world, is a matter that deserves investigating and exploring in literature. But there are much better novels that explore these problems - Brick Lane by Monica Ali and Hanif Kureishi's excellent Buddha of Suburbia 
 Virtually everywhere in this book, the author brags about how readable the book is. For one thing, after half a semester of ECON 211 Principles of Microeconomics, this book has not been helpful at all.  Graphs are placed on a page and the author spends two pages explaining the graph. The theory behind all of the paragraphs was designed to baffle instead of to enlighten. While some real-life case studies (Dell's organizational methods) are interesting reads, what the book needs to do more is to talk about applying theories to strategies in real life.  It may be true that I am taking a Principles of Microeconomics course, but in a course where I am expected to understand how to apply theories to problems in the real-world, this book is a long way from being readable or being helpful in a course in micro 
 I have nothing but respect for someone who learns enough art and enough physics to write a proper book on the topic.  Unfortunately, this author has not done so.  Put simply, this text contain information that is downright misleading.  Physics can be quite difficult, especially if one is trying to understand the esoteric worlds of relativity and modern (quantum) physics.  That said, there is no excuse for misleading a reader, when an educated layman's understanding of physics would reveal correct and useful information.  Dr Shlain states several things that would mislead a lay reader.  For example, his understanding of the way lights add is just plain wrong.  This might not harm a painter, but would harm a digital artist or someone building light sculptures.  Were said painter to think that their flawed understanding was supported by relativity, they would resist learning how lights differ from pigments, making it very hard to move to interior design or other light-based domains.  This complete failure to get the physics even close to correct makes me worry about the art history.  Again, he does not have to be an expert, but proper due diligence would suggest sending the drafts to a working art historian and a working physicist to get their feedback before inficting it on the general public.  Again, I am not claiming that one needs graduate level work to write such a book.  I do claim that one should have at least an educated layman's exposure to the feilds before taking pen in hand 
 Vincent Mosco's book is a fair introduction to political economy, yet the author fails to state that he comes from a very particular approach of political economy, namely the Marxist (some would call it neo-Marxist). As regards Mosco's boundary work towards cultural studies, I agree that the divide between political economy and cultural studies can be seen as `labour analysis' versus `cultural analysis', and further in terms of structural versus interactionist methodologies. However, I wish to reject Mosco's description of political economy as the theoretical `middle way'. Political economy does not stand out as the reconciling discipline between cultural studies and other disciplines (notably policy studies) for a number of reasons. On the most fundamental level, political economy continues to suffer from the tendency to induct all analysis to class alone, despite political economists' claim that their discipline no longer is aquainted with economism and reductionism. This is in my opinion the greatest weakness of Mosco's text. Also, there is little new to the book, although the author claims to be doing rethinking and renewal 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 A lot of things left out. Most of the stuff in the book is repeated over and over. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 As many other reviewers I was asked to read this book as a part of a college course.  My wife was recently assigned the reading in her MSW program.  I do believe it has some value, but to a specific generation and type of activist.  The book rarely (if at all) discusses a model of activism outside of that born from the peace and love movement of the 60-70s.  If you are from these eras, by all means this is the book for you.  If you are or will soon be a college student you will likely find little to connect with in the book.  I suspect that its over use in courses at this time is a result of faculty promoting a book they feel applies to them greatly without thinking of how it applies to younger generations 
 First of all this video is too short, it shows the same thing over and over and it gets old really fast.  Neither me or my son can stand to watch it more than a couple of times.  The song is kind of catchy, but it gets old fast too.  The potty does look different from any kinds I have seen as well.  On another note, it shows it in his diaper when he has gone potty, I mean isn't that a little much?  I think its just plain gross and my son probably didn't even  know what it was supposed to be anyways.  I know one of the reviewers said the kids looked too young but some of them looked too old too.  I swear one of the kids in it looks like hes four.  I wouldn't waste your money on this video, the repetetive nature of it bores the child too quickly.  
 I wish L.M. Montgomery had stopped at book number seven. The joy in reading the "Anne of Green Gables" series was that they were so optimisitic, humorous, and full of hope and happiness. This book was such a downer that I wish I hadn't read it - but how could I know I'd wish that until after I'd read it? I loved the first seven books, but if you can stand not to read the final book of a series, I'd recommend skipping this one. It was a real disappointment for me. If I want to read history and stories about "the real world" (which I certainly often do), then I would choose a book that I expected to be about that. This book does not belong in the "Anne" series 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 I wish I had read the customer reviews before purchasing this. My wife just tried to use our Kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries. Do not purchase this egg slicer! It is a waste of $10 
 This book inaccurately addresses the topic and supports false ideas. I don't see how anyone can read a book like this and take its themes seriously; especially when coupled by all its discrepancies between fact and fiction, starting with the foremost and largest falsehood...   Sexuality is a predestination, and for all but a very small few, never changes!   This book defends a falsehood and therefore lies to its readers. I would not recommend that anyone waste any part of their life reading it, especially young or otherwise adults struggling with their own sexual identity, because many of the aforementioned are rendered unstable by our society and resort to hoping for any chance of changing themselves. A book like this could only destroy people who are insecure about their identity.   What our world needs right now is a book about recognizing homosexuality and embracing it, instead of rejecting its truths as this book does. 
 What can I say?  Arlie Russell Hochschild says some interesting things about the state of the family unit in the 90s, but I just don't buy it.  She writes pages and pages decrying capitalism and its corrupting influences after studying the employees at ONE COMPANY.  If that seems credible enough for you, maybe you'll swallow this convuluted book.  But even looking beyond her flawed argument, her writing style presents many problems.  She writes not like she's presenting an intelligent sociological phenomenon, but like a novel already slated for the best seller list.  And she provides case study after case study, in what looks like an attempt to bolster her thesis, but what turns out to be just boring.  So try and skip chapters 5, 9, 10, 12, and 13.  Actually, on second thought, just try and skip this book 
 The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas 
 Doesn't get hot enough to suit me. It needs more design watts.  
 In all my years of reading fiction, I have never felt compelled to write a scathing review/inditment of a book (althought "Haunter" by so-called author Charlee Jacob came close), but this book has finally pushed me over the edge.  I was planning on going into a long diatribe about how the famous authors who submitted glowing reviews should be ashamed of themselves for misleading the public, or how there always seem to be a few of suspicious "five star" amazon reviews for books/movies no matter how abysmal they actually are (hint hint: studio plants and friends of the author).  But the best way to sum up my feelings is in this simple statement: Ramsey Campbell has gone into my wallet and stolen $7.99 (plus tax) of my hard-earned money.  It's true, I paid $7.99 for nothing and I'll never get it back.  Reading should not be a chore, and believe me, this is akin to cleaning a litter box.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  
 The title of this book should be "Photoshop Finishing Borders" Dave devotes too much time and effort giving tips on framing and giving borders to your images. There are a few other tips I was happy to see, however I have to give this one a definite thumbs down. I still love you Dave. (I want my money back! 
 The critics (or at least some of them) find this novel to be brilliant but I disagree.  The author devotes 300 pages to the protaganist's quest to feel "real" by wasting a fortune "reenacting" a series of events.  We never find out what's wrong with this guy - is it brain damage from his trauamtic injury or is he just a self-absorbed creep who now has the money to indulge himself? His obsession culminates in several deaths, which appear not to bother him in the least.  I get the feeling the author wrote this book just because he could, not because he had anything to say.  This one is all style and no substance 
 Usually, when a book is published to coincide with the release of a documentary film, the book contains details and information that serve to flesh out the synoptic look that the documentary format provides.  If you're looking for that sort of book here, I'm sorry, my friend.  This is the wrong book.  Instead of looking at the information stored in the movie, this is a making-of document.  It goes point-by-point through initial research and primary shooting up to about halfway through post-production.  Also there are little pointers interspersed through the film on how to make politically motivated documentaries, in case the reader wants to be the Cecil B. DeMille of political harangues.  I'm sure there are people who are interested in the internal controversies that accompanied designing the poster for this film.  I'm sure some people are interested on why one of the principal interviews, with a former Wal-Mart manager, takes place in a car and looks so incredibly cramped.  But that's not why I bought this book, and that's probably not why you're considering it.  This is E! True Hollywood Story stuff, not the content of a companion volume for a political diatribe.  Where this should be a book of hard facts that can be used in arguments against the continued invasion of the Wal-Martians, instead we get backlot gossip and pelf.  Perhaps another book is in the offing in the near future, containing a more detailed look at the information in the movie.  In the meantime, unless you hope to be a documentarian yourself, save your money.  This isn't the book for which you're looking 
 I found this book to be hard to read.  Take the chapter headings: who is the toddler, the challenges of being a toddler, the question of temperament...  Can you tell exactly are these about?  I can't.  Compare this with Your Two Year Old by Gesell Institute - chapters are: general characteristics of the age, the child with other children, techniques, accomplishments and abilities... The chapter headings indicate to me a much clearer organization.  If I want to know what is an age appropriate skill, I go to the accomplishments section, if I want to know how to manage a behavioral concern, I go to techniques.  The Lieberman book also uses bold face to describe some allegedly actual scenes, and it describes several in a row in unnecessary detail without directly commenting on any of them.  When it does offer advice, it is often in the form of oblique truisms, instead of simple suggestions.  It just seems like a waste of words. You can infer from the truisms what she thinks is a good way to handle certain situations, but she doesn't make it easy to find.  The Gesell book is more likely to give very concise explanations of possible behaviors, reasons for the behaviors, and good ways to manage them.    I found the Gesell book much more interesting reading because it is clearly written, and also much more useful as a reference because it is well organized. 
 I should have read the back cover more closely before buying Mirabai Starr's translation of the Interior Castle.  To her credit, she admits to her butchery of the text.  As cited by other reviewers, she provides a list of the words that she changed; Lord to Beloved, devil to "spirit of evil," sin with "missing the mark," etc.  However, all her semantics serve to do is to force the reverse translation by the reader, and it grew quickly tiresome to mentally exchange "Lord" for every instance of "Beloved."  Not to mention the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Starr had monkeyed with the text to a greater extent than she admits.  But, again, you have to admire Ms Starr's honesty in her statement that "[Teresa] would have approved of my boldness, if not the results."  This amounts to an admission by Ms Starr that her modifications substantially change the meaning of Teresa's text.  Despite all the linguistic hijinks, Starr's translation of the Interior Castle is not "Free of Dogma" as is its claim.  The concept of the soul is dogma.  The redemptive suffering of Christ is dogma.  Teresa's  patterns of prayer and life are rooted in dogma.  To attempt to pen a "dogma-free Interior Castle" is like attempting to write a "math-free Calculus".  What the attempt to "free Teresa from the cage of Christianity" reveals is a complete denial of Teresa's life and devotion.  Whatever pressures Teresa may have felt at the hands of the inquisitors and the Church heirarchy, Teresa was voluntarily a Carmelite and she deeply believed in all sorts of inconvenient things.  Teresa cannot be separated from Christianity - nor can she be separated from Catholicism.  In the end, far from being dogma-free and modernized, Starr's interpretation of Teresa's Interior Castle is simply castrated, lobotomized, sterile, and confused 
 This is an OK book for a beginner who knows little or nothing about networking. It does describe the various types of home networking available today, with a lot of information about wireless technologies. It could have been better organized by covering ethernet and wireless in separate sections. It is neither very clear for one getting started in home networking nor very helpful for one with basic knowledge who is looking to establish a more complex home network. It is an easy read and the "tips" inserts are helpful--really the best informative parts of the book. However, unless you are brand new to computers and networking, that is about all that is useful. Otherwise, save your money 
 I was expecting a workbook full of poems, instead there are a handful of poems and the rest are activities and coloring pages about the themes of the poems... which are great, but I wanted more meat... I was expecting poems along the lines of the "Goose on The Loose" and Bob Books. I guess I should have read the description more closely!! If I wanted a coloring book and activity book, I could have gotten one for far less than $10...     Maybe I am being too harsh, I will surely get some good use out of it as rainy day activties with my kids that will help reinforce some phonics. I guess it just wasn't what I expected 
 The 1994 Blackstone Audio Book version of "Turn of the Screw" is read by Pat Bottino.  Mr. Bottino's uninspired presentation destroyed the story. Perhaps Mr. Bottino got better in later ventures, I don't know, but he mangled "Turn". Avoid this version at all costs 
 Although a filter is a simple item, it just felt like this thing is even cheaper than it needs to be (quality-wise).  AllergyBeGone was pompous and rude.  I emailed when my filters didn't arrive after about 3 or 4 days.  I live in NYC, where coincidentally ABG's offices are (Brooklyn).  It took well over 7 business days to get it.  Maybe Amazon should kick ABG off their site.. 
 For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested.  I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling.  When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, "I didn't think of that one."  The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters.  The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained.  There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended.  It left me wanting to know more.... 
 I rented this movie because Marguerite Moreau looked hot on the box.  But she didn't look nearly as good in the movie.  Her character was a smoking (gross), bed-hopping slob who looked like she harbored every STD known to man.  And she thinks she has to sleep with every guy she meets in order to find love (silly).  Really no focus in this movie, not enjoyable 
 I'm with Kimberly.  Although the book is richly peppered with colour and B&W photos and drawings, the book as a whole is a prime example of Orientalist fantasizing about "othered" Muslim women gone wild.  Croutier makes blanket generalised assertions such as "In traditional Islamic cultures, most women would sooner stand naked in a marketplace than uncover their faces" and incorrectly misquotes hadith as Qur'anic text betraying ignorance of the most basic tenets and foundational structures of Islam.  If Croutier can make such simple mistakes as this, can we trust anything she has written as being anything more than snippits of wild Orientalist fantasies passed off as "fact" to an unsuspecting audience?  I think not. My advice is to cut out the pretty pictures and throw away the rest (or recycle it if you're environmentally conscious) 
 Why do you think Leary doesn't do live shows anymore?  Hicks isn't around for him to steal material from!  And that is precisely what Leary did.  He took Bill's material, excised anything controversial and intelligent (as in all of Bill's political work), added more profanity to attract the ignorant, and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material, rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator 
 I didn't find this book to be very useful at all. It was basically a short review of general dog care focussed on city living. However all the information was very breif and didn't go into very much detail. if you really want to learn more about your dog I suggest getting a book that is more focussed on just one subject. I highly suggest the book "Rover, Don't Roll Over" for positive training. This book might serve someone well as a general reference, but if you have any troubles or questions that need answering or even trouble shooting don't bother with this book. I aslo didn't like their training style, it wasn't harmful, I just don't think their particular techniques work as well as in Rover, Dont Roll Over 
 Although I really do like Ripley's writing and her stories, this one was shameful what she did to the memory of GWTW. I have to blame this on the editors. Scarlett was not the colorful character as in GWTW in this so called sequel. Publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic 
 The battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge. I made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband's dvd player and they were useless.  What a waste of my money 
 Very disappointed in the book.  Too much drama & not enough history.  Felt like I was reading the script from a made for TV docudrama 
 I actually bought this book the day it was released but I never did finish it. The first time reading it was horrible. I end up falling asleep with it in the middle of the day. I didn't pick this book up again until two days ago. Since Dream Hunter was just released, which btw is just as bad, I thought maybe I should give this book another try. I told myself, maybe the second time around would be better. It wasn't. Instead, it took me two days to finish. I never take more then a day to finish a good book. This time around I actually forced myself to finish. Ravyn was the most boring hero I've encounter and Susan was just plain annoying. I felt that this book was not meant to really tell a story of Ravyn and Susan, but it's more of an excuse to introduce characters for future stories. 
 One of Molly Appleby's first assignments now that she's working full time for COLLECTOR'S WEEKLY is to cover the kiln opening for one of the stars in Southern pottery-making. Certainly no collector worth his or her salt is going to give this kiln opening a miss, and it's almost a given that one of North Carolina's most obnoxious of collector's, George-Bradley Staunton, would be there. And when George-Stanley drops down dead (after having offended and annoyed nearly everyone at the kiln opening), Molly is sure that it's a case of murder -- even if the police have decided that George-Stanley death was an accident. Determined to make her case, Molly decides to investigate...  While J.B Stanley does a rather good job of making the pottery scene (the making and collecting) come alive, as well as peopling the book with vital and vivid characters, mystery-wise "A Killer Collection" felt a little flat. The mystery subplot unwound at a very slow pace and was a little uneven as Stanley's heroine-detective, Molly Appleby, lack-lustrely followed one strain of thought after another. The problem was that there was no sense of urgency in "A Killer Collection," and this lack of suspense and intrigue really did affect my enjoyment of the book -- no matter that I rather liked Molly Appleby. All in all if you're looking for a book that has a good plot premise, is full of vivid colour and gives you a nice idea of what clay pottery collecting is all about, than you will find "A Killer Collection" to be a charming and enjoyable read. However, if you're looking for a nice little intriguing cozy to sit down and unwind with, this book may not satisfy given that it really does lack suspense. 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 They started so good, with the album "Pocket full of kryptonite" and goes on with this. thats hurt in my har 
 Over the top attempts at wit seldom work, as this volume proves. I like dry humor, sarcasm and off the wall references, but this is just dumb 
 Wow.  Star Trek literature is simply not what it used to be. This book lacks any of the science fiction excitement that made the series itself or the better books readable. This is a collection of subpar stories slapped together to drain Trek fans' pockets, on the logic that we will buy anything that has to do with Star Trek (true enough for me in the case). Not one of these stories is memorable or compelling; they just don't feel like Star Trek.   Avoid this one and spend your money elsewhere. 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 I love Ford harrison movies and this is not a bad story but the film is shot in such dark showdy lighthing by the cinematographer that it is unwatchable that it ruins the film and all the acting, directing and writing in it. 
 I have tried really hard to like this album.  I have all of Don Henley's solo albums, all of Glenn Frey's as well, and every Eagles album, of course, and they're all very good - except this one. Actually, two stars is almost generous, because this CD is beyond mediocrity.   Don Henley is very opinionated as usual, coming down hard on everything from mass media to people who believe in UFOs, and he finds room for a few love songs as well. But he and his co-composers apparently forgot about the music. "Taking You Home" works. It's a pretty nice little ballad. And that's about it. Try as I might, I can't recall even a single chorus from the remaining twelve songs. Henley and his co-composers seem to have so much so say they forgot to write some decent music to go along with the (generally very eloquent) lyrics.  I remember listening to "They're Not Here, They're Not Coming" for the first time. I kept expecting some kind of a hook, some even slightly memorable chorus, anything. And it's almost there - but no. And that's a shame, because some of the lyrics are really good, and they could have used the company of some well-written tunes. But no, no hint of a riff or a hook anywhere.  (I know I won't get too many helpful votes on this one ;o) But reviews are written for prospective buyers, not for fawning fans who already made up their mind and decided that Don Henley can do no wrong, remember? 
 This was the cheapest phrase book that I saw offered on Amazon.com and, as trite as it is, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for the most basic of interactions with Italian speakers and are only planning on staying in tourist hotels and shopping in tourist markets, then this might suffice.  However, if you are planning to interact with native Italian speakers in a less superficial way, or if you want to be able to express yourself with somewhat more sophistication, I would recommend another phrase book.  
 Employment Law for Business, 2nd Edition, is a text that covers legal topics such as; The Employer-employee Relationship, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Affirmative Action, Employment Discrimination, Sexual  Harassment, Job Performance and Behavior, Rights of Privacy, Protection of  Employee Safety, Income, Retirement, and Health.  This is a good tool for  managers 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 I purchased the entire set of "Baby Einstein" for my baby twins, so was sorely disappointed in the "Birthday Machine" from the "Little Einsteins" series, and will never purchase another DVD from the series.  Although fun to watch and mildly educational, I found the racial and sexual stereotyping a turn-off.  We are white, and my twins are male, but I don't want to expose them to this subtle form of discrimination.  Where is the creator from "Baby Einstein"?  Girls played a prominent role in that series, and minorities were treated with more respect. 
 In the retrospective, even the author admits that this pseudo-philosophy is confused and silly. The most enraging and inhumane part of it is its megalomaniac concept of responsibility, which says that you cause *everything* in your life. If this is not insulting to the minds and hearts the the victims of force and fraud I don't know what is! I think today Landmark Education streamlined this stuff somewhat, but a little improvement doesn't make it more real then the original ideas. 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 I did not accept the item and I will not order any furniture on line any more.  They wanted to leave the table out of my house. They could have arrange with me to pay them more inorder to bring the table inside.  I could not do it alone.  This is some thing unheard of to deliver the furniture to your door.  I have alredy purchased another table and I am very happy.  Please credi my account as soon as possible.  Thanks 
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 I had to wait so long to get this book! The seller did not reply to any of my emails and did not notify me about the shipment 
 This is closest thing to an official Pretty Hate Machine remix album that you're going to find, unfortunately it only takes into account three songs from the album. This is useless for the most part and is only worth getting if you're a compulsive NIN-collector. The upside to this release is that it encompases what you get on the Down In It single and the Head Like A Hole Opal import single, so you don't have to waste the money on those by getting this. The remixes on this are horrible as far as creativity goes as compared to later remix albums around the Downward Spiral and The Fragile era remixes. This only exists because Trent Reznor wants your money so he can continue using it to go Jet-Skiing and wasting his time playing video games instead of working on a new album 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 This is only for people who don't want to take the time to listen to Dylan's Cd's form this peiod. Buy the book's about the Rolling Thunder & Gospel years.This DVD will leave you wishing you spent your money on something better 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 I really enjoyed this book.  Cohen has a straightforward yet amusing way of presenting his family's story that made it all feel very familiar to me, as though I were reading my own history.  Other facts which are included and quite interesting: information about Brooklyn, the mafia, factory life and a vivid portrait of someone who may be agoraphobic.  I finished the book in one weekend and will quite likely reread it.   
 This translation is completely unfaithful to the original.  This copy cannot be prayed or medidated with.  It's attempt to use modern language and expressions destroyed the beauty of this classic.  It is not any easier to read than more faithful translations 
 Cressida Mandeville wants to recover her family's fortune.  Her reckless idiot father gambled away their property to Lord Crofton.  Her father had hidden jewels in an erotic statue and Cressida agrees to be Crofton's mistress for a week so she can get the jewels back.  Tristan Tregallows, Duke of St. Raven, poses as a highwayman to clear his cousin's name and, thinking Cressida needs help getting away from the evil Crofton, kidnaps her.  They spend the next 350 pages being stupid.  This story was a mess.  Tris was okay for the most part.  But Cressida - what a hypocritical, judgmental harpy!  She's the Worst. Heroine. Ever.  She agreed to be a lecher's mistress, does all kinds of inappropriate things and still looks down her nose at Tris?  She's a sanctimonious shrew.  And ew, ew, ew, on page 359 she decides to have sex with Tris (they're not married) and says, "I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb."  Blech.  That's romantic HOW exactly?  I've enjoyed some of Beverley's previous books and wonder what happened with this one.  Thank goodness I bought this from a used book sale that benefited the public library - at least some good came out of the experience.  
 What happened to being and underground band with something to say? This CD does not even sound like the same band as the one on their original CD. They are trying to sound like a pop rock band and they just aren't. They should have stuck with the same style as their first CD. It was a major disapointment 
 An interpretation of science is not science and should not be presented as such.  I read this book and wasn't persuaded otherwise, thus I was displeased 
 Overall the item works well.  If keeping track of one player it is just fine.  When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player.  To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two 
  I road this bike for the first time today. I got to walk it home. The gear shifter boke off into my spokes and bent the rim. This bike is a unreliable piece of junk 
 It is a sore spot among many of my Voyager friends and I that I am not a Christie Golden fan.  However, compared to Karen Haber, I would be urged to declare Christie Golden the goddess of all Voyager books.  In reading a Voyager book I generally only find one or two errors in character traits, terminology, ship logistics, etc.  "Bless the Beast" is full of glaring mistakes.  After finding five mistakes in the first chapter, I took the initiative to earmark every page with a mistake.  There were 79 pages with errors on them, several of them with more than one!  That is quite a feat in a book with only 274 pages.  Some were small errors such as the over abundance of curse words.  Four letter words are used more in this book than probably in all of the seven seasons of Voyager.  Others were glaring mistakes such as Janeway spinning her command chair on the bridge around to face the turbolift.  I don't feel the need to explain this one since if you've ever seen an episode of Voyager you'd realise the imposibility of that.  I also found it highly annoying that Janeway would "give the bridge" to Chakotay when she left her ready room.  Clearly if she was in her ready room, Chakotay already had command of the bridge.  Ofcourse the best instance of this was when she actually "gave the bridge" to Tuvok when Chakotay was on the bridge.  I wonder how the first officer felt about that?  The author also failed to realize that Janeway's ready room and the briefing room were two seperate areas.  As such, throughout the story, Janeway has a huge conference table in her ready room.  I am interested in how this was missed.  Janeway is constantly asking someone else to do everything for her.  Anyone familiar with Janeway knows that she is a hands on captain and this would never fly. And at one point she participates in an act so cruel and completely out of character that I was shocked.  Normally I would say that I am simply being too cruel on the author due to my intense like of Janeway, however, that is not true in this instance.  If you are looking to read the worst Voyager book ever written, this is the one for you?  Otherwise, I'd avoid it like the plague 
 The authors set out on what *appeared* to be an interesting project. How could philosophy be reconstructed in order to be made compatible with the "results" of second-generation cognitive science? Yet Philosophy is not fundamentally an empirical enterprise. Empirical results, while interesting, do not often help to answer philosophical questions. Knowing that we conceptualize time as moving does little to tell us whether the A theory or the B theory of time is true. One of them must be, for they are mutually exclusive alternatives. Is space-time kind of substance, or is it merely a system of relations? Are propositions about the future true *now*? Nothing in this book will give you an inkling. The authors seem confused between a thing and and our conceptualization of it, and the majority of this book just seems like a long ad hominem circumstantial. Even if everyone who ever believed in God was absolutely insane, that would do nothing to settle the *philosophical* issue of whether or not God actually exists. The fact that we conceptualize time spatially tells us nothing about whether or not time is really like space. It might be, and it might not be, the fact that we conceptualize it thus is entirely irrelevant to the issue. The problem lies in their calling these cognitive mechanisms "metaphors", since calling them such presupposes that they cannot be literally true. Since the authors treat them as metaphors, they win by default, and there's simply no argument to be had. For example, they call "time is space" a metaphor. But is it really? The past does not seem to be co-located with the future. They do not interpenetrate each other, and this presupposes that they are indeed "separated" some quasi-spatial sense. It would have been better if the authors examine these "metaphors" as they went along to decide whether they were true or false, instead of postulating a priori that all conceptualizations must be nonliteral. For a whopping 600 pages the content is remarkably sparse. Their shallow analysis of philosophical theories is more likely to inspire laughter than serious reconsideration. Their theory of truth is also very deficient. If whatever is true is true "according to an understanding" how is it that anything ever turns out to be false? Suppose I have two patches of color that are almost exactly the same shade of red, but not quite. Let's call them red #96 and red #97. Suppose further that they look indistinguishable. Then I propose to you that the two patches are the same shade. You look at them and (mis)percieve that they are the same shade. So the proposition is true "according to your understanding". But it is in fact false. Truth fundamentally involves a relation between the asserting mind and the fact asserted, and all the cognitive science in the world cannot change that. I give this wasted exercise two stars 
 There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title.   For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source.  Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year 
 Don't waste your time or money. This was an okay book in its day (though it has zero content about altimeters) but that day is long past. The new edition of the Land Navigation Handbook covers the basics equally well and also educates on altimeters, digital mapping, and GPS. 
 I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.   Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY." 
 I bought this book because I am switching from Windows to Linux on my home network.  I thought it might be quicker to learn the ins and outs with the book vs. surfing from place-to-place on the web.  My experience with the book is not that great--it never provides enough information on any subject to answer the question I have.  I always have to resort to the internet for enough information to solve the problem of the day.  It might be o-k for general Linux information, but it won't get you up and running as a system administrator on a home network 
 I bought this book because I read other customers' good review comments.  I have to say "Don't buy it"!  The book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test.  With your common sense, you will be able to tell your child all about it.  Plus, the price is really a rob.  ...  I was fooled.  I hope you won't 
 I found this razor as the same as the other ones. Don't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one. The only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose, et 
 Believing that communal prayer, religious outfits, community life and a corporate apostolate exercised in the name of the institutional church are the essentials of religious life, Ann Carey, a writer for the conservative  Catholic press, relates the demise of the Catholic women's orders.  Blaming  the women themselves for this outcome who were, in her opinion, not mindful  of Vatican directives to modernize prior to Vatican II and too radical in  their reforms after the council, the author does not account for the  similar significant demise of men's orders.  Lavishing praise on the Church  hierarchy, she is a strict traditionalist.  If you believe that the  essentials of religious life have something to do with spreading the good  news of Christianity to all people, not just traditional Catholics, you  will hate this book.  Always deferential to the male clergy, Ms. Carey  never identifies with most of the women about whom she writes. For a  scholarly and historical treatment of the subject, no matter on what side  of the debate you stand, I would recommend Patricia Wittberg's "The  Rise and Fall of Catholic Religious Orders, Helen Ebaugh's "Women in  the Vanishing Cloister, or Carole Roger's "Poverty, Chastity and  Change.&quot 
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I can't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good to begin with.  I know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull.  Motley Crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage.  The only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts.  To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live 
 Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars. 
 Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fiancé, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne.  For the most part, only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind, or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still seems to drag at points.  Films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else. 
 I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them dont seem to care. "Oklahoma", "Carousel", "South Pacific" and "King and I" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of "An Affair to Remember") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology ("Sound of Music" is fine and "State Fair" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen 
 I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive.  A movie that I would highly recommend. 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 This book is boring.  Contrary to what some of the reviewers say, there is no substance.  I mean, you be the judge and see if you can get anything from this: desire + belief + action = success.  If you are looking for an inspirational read, this could work.  But there are no specific ways on how to become rich.  The substance portion comes in in the chapter on real estate since that is what Allen is known for but those techniques are old school.  Why don't you try to buy property no-money down right now (2006).  I don't think I'll read his books again 
 Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controlers from now on,   The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great, but again let me stresss this issue,...   it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller (that you just put batteries in, well at least you thought you did) die, and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight 
 I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap. But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate. What is it for, I can twist without it. Anyway, 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury. I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now. I am going to have to get rid of it. 
 For a book called "Full of Life," this work is surprisingly flat and boring. Not much happens in the life of John Fante. He drinks a lot, writes a little, drinks some more, abuses his wife, drinks even more, and saves just enough time to drown a sack of kittens in the kitchen sink while his children cry horrified. That's it for the drama, though. There isn't much life here, just a sad example of a generation of gruff and abusive alcoholic men slowly fading into memory. "Life" in these terms seems defined by random violent outbursts, failure and the bottle. Even Cooper's prose, fashioned to echo his idol, falls flat on the page with sentences like, "He was full of piss and vinegar." This isn't a biography as much as a eulogy to a time and a man better left forgotten. Fante's literary achievements were limited in his lifetime at best, perhaps in no small part due to his heavy alcoholism. There is nothing new or interesting here, not even a great work of art to point to and wonder. Cooper looks behind the curtain of Fante's existence, finding that whatever wizard we had imagined there had long ago crumbled to dust. There is no life here, full or otherwise.. 
 Having watched most, if not all of John Waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this Album, obviously his name was put to something he hadn't quite looked deeply enough in to. Talk about misleading. As we all know John Waters has a certain reputation for sleaze, trash, camp, kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms, this album had none of this. Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis 
 I'm sorry, but Chicken Soup for the Soul annoys me to no end.  The stories are not original-I've seen most of them in various forms in chain letters and Ann Landers and Dear Abby.  Most of them are VERY poorly written, cliched, and dumbed down.  When I'm depressed, they make me feel even WORSE.  I'd rather read a cynical, sarcastic very nasty story that makes me laugh-and realize I'm MUCH better off!   Sorry to say, but these books are nothing but dollars for the creators.  You're better off rereading childhood classics for a pick-me-up 
 I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere.  I also got the feeling that because Brooke Shields suffered PPD, she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it.  I'm sorry but I don't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much.  There are unfortunately millions of people who are poor, without health insurance, and worse without support of family and friends, that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness.  No one cares about them.  That is the saddest fact about depression in this country.    However Brooke Shields had millions of dollars to pay for help, a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it, a career that people would die for (her lack of talent doesn't seem to have affected her career much), and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out.  She also had a doctor calling her every day which I've never heard of before!  Try being without all those things when you're suffering depression.  Trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather.  I was a bit annoyed that Brooke Shields was oblivious to all this in her book.  And Tom Cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications.  I admire Tom Cruise - he is certainly far more talented than Brooke and I believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything.  However he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about!!!!  The book's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author, so it's hard to get much out of it.  This book only sold because it was about Brooke Shields 
 I never trust a book that spends the entire first chapter telling you what you will learn from the book.  And it only got worse, it seems like the authors spent most of their "ink" telling us what we were going to learn.  There was some useful info, but it could have been offered in a 3 pages pamphlet. 
 I'm usually a Clark's fan, and own several pairs, but for some reason these shoes are not as "true to fit" as Amazon claims. I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1/2 sized shoe. It's possible that I received a defective product, but you may want to consider this before making your size selection, or check other shoe sites for similar comments. Good Luck 
 This book discusses WinG graphics and while that might have been  acceptable back in win 3.1, these days it isn't even useful anymore. The  only real game programming aspects of this book focus on sprites and  clipping. Where's the networking, AI, and game engine discussions 
 Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.  
 The documentary is one of the few that Fidel Castro will allow to show on the communist Cuban television. It shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants. Completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about Cubans. No a good example. The director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered. The other ninety percent of the rafter or Balseros, not showed on this documentary of course, are mostly white, blue collar worker, professionals, and artists. I see then all the time. Why this documentary doesn't show to the world that Cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government. Balseros that came here to work hard, learn the language, make money without selling drugs. It is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware Che Gevara tee-shirt. I am sorry about my English, I am just a Balsero that came here eight years ago and now I am American citizen, own a hause,  have my own insurance business and most at all, I am free and proud to be a cuban balsero 
 At one point in time I considered myself to be LKH greatest fan.  I've been reading her books since junior high school.  I own everybook she's ever written, the entire Anita series, Meredith, Nightseer, Death of a Darklord, Strange Candy etc... I sat and read alot of the comments about her and I decided to add mine.  LKH is seriously slipping.  I mean honestly.  I have never been so dissapointed in my life as when I read her last book.  What happened to the old Anita?  The kick a#@, chick who saved the day and slaughtered the bad guys?  The Anita that mad you wanna drop everything because you just had to find out what was next? LKH's books used to be awesome they were perfect but somewhere she lost it.  As Anita progressed she just became sluttier and sluttier and then on top of that she's falling apart.  I mean Jesus does she have to sleep with everyone in the book?  A little sex is good, but when it completely takes over leaving no room for plot, it becomes ridiculous.  As for LKH and her snooty comments, the sex crazed Anita is not what started her fan base.  The smut she's writing now did not get her where she is today.  Maybe she should remember that.  I strongley recommend that if you want good reading buy her earlier books.  If you must read the new ones, go to the library because they are not worth the money 
 One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album  with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better  read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by  Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s 
 The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.  Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than 'iconic' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.  Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as "Rez," -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?  The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH. Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game. Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.  My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything 
 While enlightening I feel the title of the book can be misleading.  The title should have been "Making the Case for Simple Organic Living".  Woody gives you countless reasons why simple organic living is a path in life worth taking.  The personal anecdotes are very entertaining and eye opening.  Unfortunately I was expecting more specific examples of how one begins down the road.  Maybe Woody and his team could write a follow up.  It would certainly make a great companion book to this one 
 As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting.  I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say "Don't" and "because I said so".  While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect.  I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one.  I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues.  This book made me "think" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across.  The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'.  I wish the author could have addressed that issue more 
 This album is trash. I've heard vulgar songs, but this album is getting on my nerves just by mere sampling. Songs like 'F******', 'Play', what are those?  These guys don't even focus on lyrics. They just write generic ryhmes and the entire planet picks up their albums. HIP HOP IS DEAD! I've been listening to rap for a minute, and this album doesn't even make the cut to be called rap. His wack lyrics don't even make up for all the trash he's talking. Its this idiot who's giving rap a negetive image. When people come out and say Eminem (slim shady) or Jay-z, is one the greatest, people who listen to guys like David Banner start getting pissed off. Those people who listen to beats and ryhmes, and very uncreative sexually charged songs. Go listen to Slim shady/mixtape-type-Eminem, Jay-z, Nas, Saigon, Canibus, Grafh...Something more creative.  I don't recommend this garbage 
 I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't.. 
 I bought this from Home Depot for $12.59.  I was mainly curious what kind of heat I could get out of a machine that was less that $13.  With the fan set on high, and the temp. at max, this unit heats up about 1' directly in front of the fan, and about 1-2' directly above it.  So, unless you just want to set it on the floor and warm up your feet, I would say use that $13 and put it towards another heater........I will be returning it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will save some people some trouble and now you know what to expect 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 I really don't mean to sound judgmental but this was the very worst book I have ever read.  I mean even Nancy Drew books have more of a mystery than this one did.    I have always heard good things about the Jesse Stone Novels.  This was the first and only one I will read.  I don't know if the grammatical errors were the author's fault or the editor's.  Even the dialogue between characters didn't even have complete sentences.  Very poor sentence structure.  I agree with C. Richard's review..."Distracting" in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus.  Ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was.  This is the only review I have given that has been a poor one.  
 Buffalo Springfield has got to be the granddaddy of dysfunctional rock groups. On all 4 albums there was at least on member not around, and on this one it was Bruce Palmer the bassist. He was deported back to Canada for drug possession, and also for walking off the stage during a concert in which he, Neil Young, and Stephen Stills all got into a tizzie. The result would be that Palmer's gone, and now you bring your sound engineer in the name of 19 year old Jim Messina, and you move on. The result is "Last Time Around". By this time it was obvious no one was interested in going on. The material is at best experimental and creative in some spots, but other than that it was to fufill a contract, and let's go our own ways. Of course set on a course of which music was going through a muck of mire where you had bands like The Yardbirds, Cream, The Troggs, and The Byrds breaking up, and others experiencing revival like Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and Dion, and others going through a transformation like Bob Dylan, The Moody Blues, and The Byrds, and then you mix into all this the ones going backwards like The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, plus adding new blood to the mix like Blue Cheer, The Chambers Brothers, and Vanilla Fudge not to mention the artists who were still popular, and or up and coming, so it's a interesting time to be a rock and roll star. However, with "Last Time Around" this was the end for Buffalo Springfield. Stills would join up with David Crosby, Neil Young would have a taste of freedom before joining Crosby and Stills at Woodstock, and Richie Furay, and Jim Messina would form Poco, and Messina leaves after 3 albums to join Kenny Loggins. The material here is very diverse, and rooted around soul, country, and blues. "On The Way Home" has a pop flavor which is very unusual for Neil Young, but to me is a very depressing Sunday record as it gives me melancholy of Sundays ending, and rest is almost over, and then back to the grind. "Pretty Girl Why?" is also like "Incense and Peppermints" a rock and roll suicide. Also depressing, and then there's "I Am A Child" the other contribution of Neil which shows what he would do a few years down the road with the album "Harvest". "Uno Mundo" has a carribean flavor to the song, and it makes me wonder if they may have spent some time listening to Chris Montez, or Trini Lopez when doing this song. Probably my favorite tune here is Richie Furay's song "Kind Woman". It's a nice slice of country music. However, with all the diversity, and talent the group would disband on May 5th, 1968. 
 It takes more than a libertarian protaganist and statist antagonist to have a libertarian novel.  A true political novel tries to demonstrate through the writing the moral superiority of the political system advocated by the author, be it libertarian (such as L. Neil Smith), conservative, communitarian, etc., and simply choosing the ideologies of the main characters does not do that.  Token attempts are made at this, such as the government being after the family of the dissident who dares advocate libertarian ideas, but no doubt the same government goes after dissidents who advocate other ideas that the government does not like.  Nor does this book actually qualify as a dystopia.  It takes more than an oppressive government to make a dystopia - in a dystopia society itself is warped in ways that would be considered monstrous to most people (such as Orwell), even if some dystopias seem pleasant enough on the surface (such as Huxley).  All there is in this book is an overly strong government that oppresses people who disagree.  The characterization is flat.  That may be a common complaint in libertarian literature, indeed all political literature, but in this case it is more so.  It is not a case of one side being all good and the other side being all bad as Ayn Rand would write.  In this case I see little moral difference between those who hold different ideologies, even to the main character being just as insulting to his peers of different beliefs as they are to him.  All this book amounts to is an action-adventure sci-fi novel, and not a strong one at that, with political polemics getting in the way 
 Did not help! I'm still fat and ugly! Email and help me please 
 This book is not for programmer who needs more exlanation They tried to explain everything in shot...  
 Wow.    Hollywood Symphony Orchestra MY BEHIND!!  This was the crappiest 4 bucks I've ever spent...  Immediately after reading the following from the back of the CD...  "Earth has been decimated by a meteor... The beautiful and capable Dr. Aki Ross is Earth's last hope against extinction.  This new recording, featuring the world-renowned Nobuo Uematsu, captures the excitement and drama of this popular videogame-turned blockbuster movie."  a few things... 1) to the right of the above paragraph was this message: "THIS RECORDING IS NEITHER SPONSORED OR ENDORSED BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS OR OWNERS." 2) The writer for the CD cover has clearly not ever played any of the FF games--he fails to notice that any of the FF games are continuations.   3) The FF film was not "a blockbuster movie".    Look, if you want to have better covers of Final Fanatsy music, scrounge around in  ocremix.org or vgmix.com  Amateurish digital instrumentation, completely craptastic.  I'd give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option.. 
 I am an easy to please reader...a little suspense, a little gore, a semi-believable plot and I am content.  This joke had me totally disenchanted from page one.  The plot is so totally CONTRIVED and unsuspenseful it will shock you.  Of course everyone who reads this review will discount it as most other reviews are favorable but BELIEVE ME this was awful and I'm trying to save you from wasting your hard earned cash.  It's the least I can do 
 "Teach Me Sweetheart" and "Waiting To Know You" get a lot of play around my parts. Likeable, but heavy on the weirdo synth sounds. Ease off the Pro Tools knobs man 
 The author of Unholy alliance and Sinister Forces-The Nine, did not write this book. If he did it was another personality.  Did he double?  Like he claims so many have or could have? Maybe the Nazi's did get him in South America, and wiped his memory, if not the nazi's, then someone did.  This book was slop. Almost as if someone else wrote it. Some adolescent. The other reviewers are correct, BIASED is plain language. How he can blast the RNC while no mention of the filthy treacherous dirty deals of the DNC, or a reason to praise the Clinonistas is beyond belief. They are BOTH dirty. There was no honesty here.   I guess with all his research ability, he chose selective or "erased" the memory of Mena Arkansas!   It was a sloppy FLUFF center to his oreo "Grimore". Which in book one led you to believe he had a premise that would lead somewhere. Ramblings on message boards are better written. The author of Unholy Alliance did not write this book. Disgusted. ROBBED 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 So sad to see that this was "Manufactured in China," otherwise I would have given this heart-tugging nostalgia-waxing book 5 stars. Sigh, is nothing sacred anymore? Apparently not 
 I'm amazed this book received so many good reviews, the only reason I can see is that the reviewers are all Managers or it's a sign of a skewed process.  Anyway the books own description should give it away "Intended for both business people and technologists".  What are the chances of that being true?  I'd say none.  Basically this is a Managers book with all the consultant doublespeak you'd expect.  It's written from such a high level it will give you nose bleed and makes tons of assumptions that only a Manager would buy into.  If you are a techie and buy this book you will waste your time at best and learn misleading/incorrect info at worse 
 If you want details about actually doing the work, buy a different book... 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 I'm a big fan of the Klutz line in general, but this one was a major disappointment.  After having much success and fun with their Beadlings and Beaded Rings books, and being both a lifelong crafter and an experienced knitter & crocheter, I thought the Spool Knitting book would be fun & easy to take on.  What a great idea, adding beads and elastic into the spool knitting craft!  However, this kit turned out to be a great idea that was very poorly executed by Klutz.  BEAD AND CORD ISSUES:   The smaller beads supplied in the kit are WAAAYYYY too small in diameter to easily string on the narrowest elastic cord supplied in the kit, and even after following the book's suggestion to dip my elastic cord ends in clear nail polish, they continued to fray and I continued to struggle with stringing the supplied beads.  It was more frustrating than fun, and I couldn't substitute my own, larger-holed beads because they'd be too big to pass through the supplied knitting spool.    SPOOL ISSUES: When using the wider elastic cord and slightly larger beads from the kit, it's hard to fit the beads between the spokes of the knitting spool.  Also, the knitted tube must be forced through the knitting spool because the spool's center hole isn't wide enough to easily accomodate a beaded tube.  The result is more fraying and more frustration.    I ended up dumping the supplied beads into my general beading stash and giving the elastic cord to my neices to make themselves necklaces by stringing some of my own beads on the cord.  Klutz should've supplied narrower elastic cord for use with the smallest beads (or if that wasn't possible, small-size beads with larger holes in them), and and a wider-diameter knitting spool.  I still have no use for the Klutz knitting spool, as it's too small for use with regular yarn.    Klutz was always my "go-to" for reliably fun, easy, quality craft kits, especially for kits to use with kids; unfortunately, now I'm going to have to check their stuff out just as thoroughly as I would any non-Klutz kit, and test their kits out myself before getting the kids involved.  
 I would not even give this book ONE star if I had a choice!  Although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading, and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a DIFFERENT exam, it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam.  The book should have been titled "Some really really basic Windows Server Infrastructure info and JUST BARELY scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam!"  The book was short and easy reading and I aced all the questions at the end of each chapter.  But when I took a real practice test by SelfTest software, I got 5 questions out of 50 correct on my first try.  NOT A GOOD START for the exam which I wanted to take next week.  The questions on the practice test that I got wrong were NOT even covered in any respect in the book.  I've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and I can tell you that I know what to expect from a book and from the MS tests and this book does almost NOTHING for you in regards to the exam.  Sure, it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info, but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam, SKIP this one.    I am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a REAL book!  
 This book is embarassing.  Even worse than Icons of Evolution.  What he presents as science is mostly a mix of ignorance and outright lies.  There are many sites by real scientists which expose Wells' errors and fabrications step by step (Panda's Thumb is a good one.) Anybody who is unfamiliar with the actual scientific literature on evolution would be well advised to visit one of those sites and at least begin the process of self education.  If you do, you will quickly see how unreliable Wells is as a science writer 
 I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one. 
 I took Prof Kwon's class and used this book.  It was very difficult to understand.  Bathe's book is much more clear. 
 After attending several of mr. Dershowitz's lectures I had expected better.  The dialouge in this book is almost too painful to read.  To think that this book came from the mind of such an eloquent orator.  Mr  Dershowitz should stick to the spoken word 
 I felt rather disappointed reading this book. I seems to me that the author failed in giving a convincing picture. His comparisons of the Vietmam experience and classical or Homeric Greece are either superficial or forced. I suppose that the book may attract persons more involved in the Vietnam affair than I but I am convinced that this is caused by the Vietnam experience and not by the comparisons with classical Greece 
 I didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.   I have many of her videos and I'm a true fan of hers 
 my purchase arrived in good time. case was in good condition. said it was new but the cds didnt play good. some episodes would skip and not play at all, not very happy with item. 
 This book is really nothing more than a collection of generalized knowledge, and some good pictures.  I don't need someone to tell me in a book that I need an engine, transmission, etc to build an old school bobber. "How to" suggests exactly that - you are going to tell me how things get done, and provide me with some good instructions, tips, tricks, and pictures to go along with it.  If you want a book that gets down to the nuts and bolts of the building process, buy something from a different author because this book won't tell you how to build the bobber you want 
 The book we received was not the full book with the ISBN number we ordered. It was volume one of two with a different ISBN number, which was clearly noted on the back of the book. We had to send the book back AT OUR EXPENSE 
 This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences 
 I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...  My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement. 
 Just in time for Christmas is an overpriced book about how much  Doro loves Daddums. The book is a poorly edited collection of  anecdotes that aren't really funny or interesting. (Indeed, they  sound as if they've been transcribed from tapes.) Granted,  daughters have a right to write about Daddy, but this book  makes Ronald Reagan's kids' books look like giant works of art.  What is it about the children of Republicans that makes them  think they can write something of interest?  There are at least 20 very good books about George Sr....  get one of those instead 
 I agree with Mr. Lentini. If you want to learn something about fuzzy logic - look for some other book. This is actually a booklet that only characterizes Fuzzy Logic in a very childish manner. The translator is an utter ignorant: Leibnitz is called "Ripunitz" and Aristole is "Alistoter" or something like that (probably following the Japanese transcription...). Even 1 cent is a waste for it 
 The premise seems simple enough.  However, the functional set up of the board is too complicated for this age group.  The peg is difficult for small hands due to the lip at the bottom, which also prevents young eyes from seeing the holes they are trying to count.  The holes, themselves, are too close together.  It is very difficult for a smaller child to accurately count on this board.  Finally, the game is boring to small children.  After 6 or 7 turns, the child's attention span is gone 
 Volf's book is not so much about a Trinitarian theology of the Church as it is a theological foundation for the ecclesiology of free and congregational churches. Volf is presenting a case for the inclusion of  free churches within what is commonly known as the holy catholic, apostolic  and universal Church. He compares the ecclesiology of the free  (congregational) churches with the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Church.  Naturally, he does not totally accept their systems. However, he does  recognize the value of the relational ties that connect the parishes  together in their respective traditions. He rejects their hierachial  structures, but values the quality of community that exists beyond the  local congregation. The larger community is an antidote to parochialism and  the danger of local congregations becoming merely religious clubs  consisting of like minded persons. Yet, he sees the real strength of  Christianity residing in the local congregation. He supports the grassroots  or bottom up system of inter-congregational relationships. His ideal of a  cooperative Christian community is Trinitarian in nature, many equal bodies  joining together to form one unity which is not greater than the sum of the  parts. He sees the opposite in the Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions.  There, the many have their origin from the one. The whole gives identify to  the many, and without the unity of the one, the many cannot exist. He  understands the Holy Trinity as being three separate and equal persons of  the same substance making up the Godhead. This view is part of his  justification of free church ecclesiology. He says that the Orthodox and  Roman Catholics have a trinity of unequal persons and practice an  ecclesiology of inferior parts. 	Volf presents a strong academic  defense for free church ecclesiology. It is a defense with many useful  insights, even for traditions with an episcopalian structure. However, a  general weakness of his work is the assumption that all local churches and  parishes perfectly practice the theologies and doctrines of their  respective traditions. I believe that there is more diversity within  denominations and traditions at the local level than anyone  in higher  academic or ecclesiastical circles wants to admit.  	Volf carries on a  hypothetical dialogue with John Zizioulas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger who  represent the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church respectively.  He claims to present their authentic positions by offering quotes from  their writings, However, he is the one selecting the passages to debate. I  do not know the context from which he selected the passages; thus, I am not  able to determine his objectivity. Ratzinger and Zizioulas do not carry on  any authentic dialogue with Volf; it is quotation without true  participation. I feel that Volf is presenting Zizioulas and Ratzinger from  a position that is most favorable to his cause. Even with this most  favorable presentation, I still find myself agreeing more with their  positions than with Volf's. This is somewhat unusual because I usually  disagree with Ratzinger on most issues. Also, at times, there seems to be a  similarity between Ratzinger's idea of ecclesiolgy and those of John Wesley  in my own Methodist tradition 
 My second disc, side one, skips, pauses, rolls back -- tell me how can I right this 
 I really expected more out of this book, it was a disappointment.  If you have no idea about property management then this book is probably good.  If you are already in the business, it's probably not all that helpful.  I expected more details and this was an overview 
 the movie is a total bomb in every way, starring high school dropout hilary swank as a teacher trying to convince kids not to...drop out. the real story is a rehash of stand by me, the substitute, etc. i'm sure you could find 2 dozen previous examples of 'teacher who believes in at-risk youths' or 'teacher who cares when no one else did'. and they'd all be better than this nonsense. in addition, the kids (from all backgrounds) are all so cliched it's ridiculous. pass on this book.    
 This is not a paperback edition of the book!  This only a study guide which includes notes.  If you are looking for the actual book...this is not it, even though it says that 
 I really disliked this book for several reasons. Lasch isn't a clear writer; he rarely makes his own opinions or arguments apparent. Despite the book's polemical title, it mostly recounts intellectual history, namely the evolution of the concept "family" in the social sciences from the late 19th century. Lasch's style shifts abruptly from dryly summarizing and analyzing the positions of those he likes (Waller, Parsons to a degree, anyone remotely Freudian) to offhandedly dismissing those he doesn't (most radicals and feminists). He wastes a lot of space on marginal figures and keeps the really important ones (Marx, Freud) in the background as a sort of assumed ground for his analysis. This might be the most irritating aspect of the book: he's heavily invested in Freudian psychology and treats it as gospel, at times making grossly unfounded claims based upon Freud's speculations. The book is uneven too: these Freudian ideas appear mostly in the final chapters, while the book begins in a very Marxist frame of reference. Oddly, Lasch seems to use all these theories for rather conservative ends. And Lasch's own smarmy preface shows that other readers have had the same reactions that I do.   The main point of the book seems to be that the modern "haven" form of the family needs to be preserved against the "progressive" forces of modern society, especially the medical and psychiatric and other professions (i.e., Jacques Donzelot's "the social") that seek to replace it. Lasch seems to think that the haven family-by combining love with authoritarian discipline-is perhaps the only thing that can create strong, integrated, individual personalities. The permissive, friendly family and the intervention of "the social" professions only creates weaklings, nihilists, and totalitarian personalities. Lasch's support for this conclusion is unconvincing: he basically says that without the combination of love and discipline in the same unit (a mother and a father), the child will eventually come to see authorities as simultaneously personable and distantly oppressive. The result is the antisocial or "narcissistic" personality, premised on the avoidance of conflict and "liberation" from emotional entanglements. This personality also demonstrates a reliance on institutional forms of authority (e.g., mass media) combined with a conspiratorial suspicion of authority (due to lack of any real disciplinary figure-a strong father in other words). This seems like a conservative twist on Susman's character/personality distinction, Riesman's self/other-directed personalities, and the Frankfurt School's analyses of totalitarianism.  If the "haven" form of the family arose-ironically, as Lasch notes-out of modern society and capitalist culture, as a counterbalance to competition and so on, then how can it ever hope to be anything but a palliative measure? If work was ever to be "reorganized" along more humane lines (xvii), as he calls for in crypto-Marxist fashion, then why would the family even be necessary? Assuming that the intervention of the social actually is undermining privacy, why is privacy a good thing? Why try to prop up the haven rather than make the world less heartless? I think Lasch is a neo-liberal; he assumes that experts can't be controlled by society, he expects that any collective will be totalitarian and oppressive, and he defends privacy (the essence of private property) without question. He's also quite sexist, presupposing that only a father's authority can create a well-adjusted child.   If you're interested in family studies, I'd recommend the following books instead:  - Barrett & McIntosh. The Anti-Social Family. - Coontz. The Way We Never Were. - Foucault. History of Sexuality, Vol 1. - Coontz. Social Origins of Private Life. - Zaretsky. Capitalism, the Family, and Personal Life. 
 But not enough to explain any one process through. OSX users, be advised, most of the dialog boxes are Windows which you need a magnifying glass to see. 
 Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored.  The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent.  The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.  I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read.  The dreadful ending just caps it all off.  A real waste of time 
 This book was good for the first 40 pages but that's it. Hochschild gets across the interesting truth that some Americans work and don't spend time with their families because work is a reprieve from the stress of home and family life. This is really the crux of the book; the rest is mainly filler. Hochschild doesn't provide much more insight or scientific rigor and support to these observations. I agree with the above reviewer that the writing is quite poor: convoluted; however, I wouldn't even give the writing the compliment of being novel-like. The writing is trite and character placements a headache 
 This book is quite a disappointment. I wanted to read the book through but I just couldn't get myself to finish it. I'll illustrate why:  It's written very badly. If you've ever read the outside of a bottle of Dr. Bronner's soap, you'll know the basic style. Take that mess of sentence making, mash it together with the story-telling method of a 3 year old and crush it under a heaping sack of gluttony glorification and sketchy opinions masked as facts... then you're a little closer to Postrel's performance in this book. I'll attempt to emulate: "Stuff is happening! Blaaaahhhh! There's this and stuff and this and that and stuff and and and it's SO GREAT that we think we're so rich and we can buy everything from brand names and this unrelated person said that and this and other random people said other things I can jumble into how I love not thinking about anything beyond the surface of magazine articles and corporate marketing is so great and people LIKE it! Blaah!" Other irritants include her frequent use of listing in paragraph form, rapid-fire name dropping and quoting of unintroduced people, deceptive use of the english language, jumbled or contradictory anecdotes, and not concluding the inklings of any point. Her writing gets less frantic the farther she goes but it doesn't ever reach a point at which I would call 'good' or even 'skilled'. Doing spot checks throughout the remainder of the text reveals nothing more than a slower pace of stream of consciousness without conscience.  An organized thought? Cohesion? Sorry.. The chapters I read contained no structure, no organization of thought, no points of cohesion throughout their entirety. If there was a point behind the apparent meaning of each word in series, I must have missed it. Because as far as I could tell, everything was face value and no further.. and that face is an ugly portrait of average, current mass-media writing. It's almost as if Postrel is not really a human but a author simulator, programmed to take magazine archive keyword searches and mash them chaotically together with marketing slop and corporate praise. A human would take all that data and assemble it into a flow of thoughts, reflections and deeper postulations to form a book. A badly written software program though, would do as she has done and vomit a number of barely formed paragraphs of pseudo-speak into a large number of random pages. Don't believe me? Go to any one page, anywhere in the book and start reading. Do so again. It's the same effect as starting at the beginning and reading the pages in numeric order. Maybe she IS just a computer program. Her picture in the back certainly looks like a stock photo. Wouldn't surprise me a bit.  The point of view is seriously out of touch. Her angle of attack in this book seems to be written by someone who doesn't exist outside of what other people are writing and saying in popular media. In her fantasy world, all Americans are rich, we love corporate marketing and we don't notice or care about why things are made in China, why people are poor and starving, or why anyone should care about anything that isn't a famous person or a name brand.  Her stance is very pro aristocrat I personally am offended with her glorification of all things aristocratic. In the same way it's not nice to give praise to bullies, I don't appreciate tone of her statements writing off origins and consequences of americorp imperialist dominance as fine and dandy. Everything beyond that it seems, is not worthy of her attention. For the sake of a book like this though, it should be. Her bias causes the book to fail yet again because it NEVER DOES grapple any substance within the plasticine fantasy vapor of what she defines as style. She just cheers the bullies of industry from the insidious sidelines of pretentiousness. Her only goal past that seems to be circuitous statements trying to convince you that all of that is okay 
 This book tries to persuade the reader that  predjudices, biased opinions, ect. have led the west to unjustly distrust the followers of Islam.  It is understood by most that  the Muslims of Bosnia (for example) are nothing like those in the  midde east, which has become a breeding ground for hate and violence.  Children are taught from the earliest days to hate Jews and almost everyone else.  I think one should examine the thoughts of Islam by spending a week or so reading Aljazeera online re: ((...)). Then, if you are still so inclined to do so, waste your money on this book.  (... 
  This book will be really useful for you if you're still living in 1975 and are only interested in justifying what you already think. It clear that while some individuals spoke presumptuously about 1975, the WTB&TS never officially made the statements that apostates claim. 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Simultaneously examining the first, second, and third waves of American feminism in her unprecedented volume, Sara M. Evans unwittingly squanders the tremendous potential from her initially good intentions.   Falling into the same 'post-feminist' trap readers are ironically warned against throughout the text, this book cannot unify second and third wavers. I certainly appreciate and have benefited from the work accomplished during this time period and am personally/professionally friends with individuals, but cannot see how a book ignoring my own generation's political activism is supposed to unify the two generations at large  Sharply contrasting with the glowing treatment given to herself and other second wavers, Evans only introduces the third wave as "recent participants in a world transformed by their mother's generation" (p. 213). In addition to implying that myself and others are really only interloping guests at 'somebody' else's social justice movement, this remark overlooks the critical perspectives we bring precisely as a consequence of growing up without legal segregation, with Title IX, Special Education, and many other programs which were only a dream for her generation.   While giving the 'riot grrrl' movement only one paragraph, she is oddly eager to devote much more book space to the faux feminists who made their public names attacking previous feminist theory (p. 221). Agreeing that it made for great mass media sensationalism, I do not accept this latter category as representative of my generation of feminist theorists, and am disappointed by Evans's stereotypes.   After ironically establishing how bias keeps women from being aware of their past (p. 38) she then specifically minimizes a feminism (which unlike the drivel by Roiphe, Summers, and Hoff) represented a major public resurgence of progressive ideas. Riot Grrrl theory argued that all forms of oppression are connected although patriarchy under girds this society. Just because something is different from her own generation does not excuse Evans from taking it seriously during the research process.      Other truly intergenerational feminist authors previously have argued the movement needs to make genuine efforts either to fully become or remain multigenerational, but Evans is blissfully oblivious to this necessity. In it's current state the book has no academic or personal redeeming quality and substantial revisions are needed to accord equal respect to all feminist generations.     
 Though much of his information is accurate, Nadler makes the crucial error of relying only on wriiten text, ignoring the vast rich oral history of this historic topic. In addition he declares that "half of todays  Orthodox Jews are Mithnagdim", this iserroneous.  "Mithnagdim" literally means "opposed", there is no  longer any substantial oppositionto Chassidism among Orthodox Jews. Though  roughly half are not Chassidim per se, thay include many Sefardim and  others who never opposed Chassidus. Even among Lithuanian Jewry, only a  small percentage actually follow the customs of the revered Gaon of Vilna,  and many of their descendants have now incorporated many Chassidic  teachings and customs 
 If current readers want some sense of how academic writing can serve the interests of those who have and want to hold onto power, they should read this book.  They can take it as a fine example of how government and their intellectuals produce stories to support their own positions and find in them the words and language they need to justify and 'explain' their actions.  Kagan's enormous attack on John Kennedy (nicely refuted in recent writings on JFK) aims to shatter the idea that there are other ways of dealing with power than those recommended by the chicken-hawklets in the Bush administration.  Also, there are other things to say about Thucydides than those Kagan chooses as essential to understanding war and the preparation to 'deter' it.  Surely readers notice how often Kagan offers accounts of 'pre-emptive' wars 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 I had read the first chapter or so of this book in my email book club. I enjoyed it, and felt that Emily would be a relatable and interesting character, so when I saw it in my public library, I decided to give it a try. I read the whole thing in about a day, not really because it was great--more so that it was just a very quick, light read. The authors fail to develop some of the most interesting characters beyond mere cliches, and spend too much time on less interesting ones.   Now, I'm not saying the book wasn't cute and amusing--a quick, light, and often funny read. (I almost think Emily's hilarious boss was the highlight of the whole book!) But I, like several other reviewers, was disappointed about the lack of depth of spiritual depth. Emily, in the beginning of the story, seems like she will be the kind of girl to have a strong faith and stand out from the crowd. After all, she always says she wants to change the world. But, instead, she follows the crowd, doesn't even admit she's a Christian to her closest friends, (she only admits she's a Christian to her very closest friend, and stands up for her faith at the very last minute, so that it hardly seems sincere) and begins drinking rather heavily. I thought the authors would use that to show how she'd changed by the end of the book, but it instead shows her laughing with her friends (over multiple beers) about how she refused to drink alcohol the first time they went out to a bar together. Another thing that bothered me was how Emily attended a singles bowling night with Christians from a local church, and repeatedly put them down, portraying them as boring, corny, and behind the times. I sincerely hope that the authors (and am almost sure that it was not their intent) did not mean to put down more conservative Christians, who do not drink and who don't try to be worldly, as Emily does. But, even if the scene was intended to be funny, it fell rather flat.  Overall, the book was cute and funny, but not one that did anything at all spiritually. Emily doesn't change the world, and this book certainly won't change anyone's life 
 We were very disappointed with the musical quality of the CD.  The artist's command of pitch was lacking 
 Book is written in Fantasy, no real research done.   Absolutely trashy, no academic value.  Avoid 
 To use a Mets phrase, "It's amazing" that Jeff Pearlman can make a living focusing on the dark side of people. Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more.   This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison.   Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic.   We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall.   The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won.   What more did you really want from them?  Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know. 
 I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera. After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate. I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers. 
 it's all in the interest of personal development; yours truly is currently going through a 'face your demons' phase.  this is where you beg steal or borrow (but never, EVER buy) albums by people you count musically as villians, be it the type of 'artist' who inspires the type of po-faced reverance that makes an iconoclast like me's fists itch (dylan et al) or bands that were launched in a blaze of hype, championed by the music press to the detriment of other more worthy bands, a la suede. assuming that most people reading this are american, you can count yourselves lucky that unless you pored over the nme and the now defunct (yay!) melody maker that you missed said wave of hype.  said that, i'm sure you see it happening with other bands even now. so what of it now.  well, like so many others in this demon slaying, it turns out thati was right and suede...weren't very good at all.  to whit, a lead singer who sounds like he's got a raw onion shoved up his rectum and a sub-glam sound.  and that is that.  oh there are one or two interesting moments - 'drowners' starts off with a drum riff similar to simple minds 'boys from brazil' (i'll wait for the suede fans here to check their history, i'll be here a while - it's kinda like a tortoise and hare/ evolutionary curve thing) before descending into a morass of mediocrity.  'moving' is perhaps the only track worth saving - so that's one out of eleven?  well done! if people had seen this album on its release for what it was maybe they'd bugger off and leave us alone.  instead the music press (bless their rotten little hearts) conspired to fool the general public into believing something special was going on.  meanwhile, yours truly sat here saying "...erm, actually people...these guys suck".  oh well. once more:  nothing to see here folks, don't believe the hype.  
 Hunt this book down. Read "The Bet" (pp. 131-134). Put this book down. Leave the store satisified knowing that you have read the only  humorous story in this collection.  Sure you could read some other stories in the book, but they're so terribly unfunny that you will invariably come to hate yourself and everyone around you for being in a store that carries this dreadful book.   The only way these stories could possibly be funny is if they were somehow adapted for a series of SNL skits, in which McSweeney's unfunniness were somehow reversed by the lens of SNL's unfunniness. Come to think of it, this book is just as awful as SNL, except that you can't change the channel. You're just stuck there on the subway wishing you'd picked up that AM Metro, desperately trying the read the Wall Street Journal (or even the Daily News) over the shoulder of the person next to you. Anything - just anything -  to avoid the tears of boredom that come from reading this garbage.  So, If you like late-model SNL and you can read, you may like this. But I doubt it 
 The book jacket description listed here is misleading. This book sheds very little light on any of the individual Maryland families mentioned in the title. Its focus is on wealthy colonists as a class with little emphasis on the individual families. Furthermore, it is not really a study of the 'Maryland' elite as the title says, because it primarily limits itself to only two counties in Maryland. The book might be interesting to historical sociologists but I doubt that anyone wishing to learn details of old Maryland families would be satisfied with this purchase 
 How could Rhymesayers let this hit the streets?  With all of the negativity thrown towards the underground movement here in the mid-west (read URB magazine for example).  I just don't see the point of releasing garbage like this!  It's not helping!  Why Blueprint..why?  Here's why...Slug taught you how to rap, that's why.  Where's the stuff kids really want to hear?....new Brother Ali, E&A, even Mac Lethal's new album will probably hit harder than this...and that's not saying much.  Now RJD2, did you just gather up the scrap beats that didn't make the cut for Aceyalone's new album?  (which IS terrific, so pick it up!)  I've come to enjoy a lot of the Rhymesayers releases, however, recently I've been hyped up and then let down over and over.  First with Boom-Bap then P.O.S. now RJD2 and Blueprint can't even hit me up with anything worth while.  This is the first cd I've bought in awhile that I've just wanted to break over my knee.  Do yourself a favor and miss this cd like you missed Chronicles of Narnia in theaters.  Peace,       Ekyr 
 I loved the book and the film of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP when they first came out.  Then I read THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE.  I thought it was horrible.  When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).  No.  THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.  The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky.  I never believed them.  They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them.  Stylistically, it's just confusing.  When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for.  Slapstick incest?    I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over 
 Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be 
 This guy doesn't know the first thing about how to trade.  I have been a full time trader and hedge fund manager for years all this chump does is talk about completely unreal expectations, avoids the real issues, and blows smoke.  Avoid this book if you want to be profitable in the markets.  It will only confuse you and lead you astray.  There are also spellin gmistakes everywhere.  Its very annoying reading and serves no purpose but the author's own.  Avoid 
 I was disappointed in this book. After seeing her on television, I thought it would be a great book to have and be full of helpful information. I found that most of her solutions to problems were addressed with purchasing her products. It was my understanding that there were inexpensive ways, items from your home & items easily purchased from your local drug store  - which could accomplish the same results as the more expensive remedies & name brands. I did not find the suggestions to be any cheaper than what I was purchasing myself beforehand.  There were some solutions she suggested that worked okay, but I found I was trying too many products, spending more money and not getting the good results stated in the book.  Examples: She says to "cleanse" before doing certain things like exfoliate - she does not address cleansing.  She suggests that "exfoliating" will help with the removal of blackheads - but doesn't tell how to remove the blackheads from the face safely without bruising or scarring the skin.  After reading the book I came away with only one or two remedies that worked.    I would not have purchased this book if I had known the above.  
 I'm a big fan of the Golden Age characters. If you enjoy these original heroes, and their continuing stories, you might not enjoy the last few surviving characters acting without good judgment. I'm one of the people that think the outcome of Crisis was poor. The multiverse was not so messy that we have to lose all our golden age characters. Earth 2 was a place where it was okay for heroes to age, retire, and train the next generation of heroes.  This book gives us northing original, it's boring, and abuses good characters to no good end. It uses the time tested gimmicks of having a "Hero Go Bad", "Bringing back characters that seemed forgotten", "involving everyone", "Wonder Woman kills someone(gasp...yawn)", and so on.  Been there, done that, have the bumper sticker, T-Shirt, coffee mug, snap shots, and the key chain. 
 I hadn't heard much about this film before buying it, slightly varying reviews, but that was about it. I thought being almost entirely set on a plane, it might be claustrophobic and it was very!  I'm surprised at Jodie Foster taking on this kind of role, but I have to admit she did well in the role, although she didn't have to stretch herself too far for the role. It was very basic.   The thing about Flightplan is that although the cast are good (Sean Bean, Peter Saarsgaard, and Erika Christensen), the plot really isn't up to much. A child could have dreamt up this plot, it's very basic, and it could have been set on nearly any form of transport, and it still would have been the same. It's just cos it's in the air, that it makes it what it is. But it's very racist at the same time, as Jodie's characters "thinks" she saw two foreign men across the road from her the night before getting on the plane, and then she "thinks" on the plane they're there, and they kidnapped her daughter. This plotline is started, but never really completed, and it's just another plotline in a dizzying number of them. The actors try to do their best in a film that has so many twists and turns, you never know what's going to happen next. But Flightplan goes one twist too many, and by the end of the film, you don't really care what happens, you just want it over. And there are quite a few plotholes as well, but it doesn't really matter.  Jodie should never have agreed to do this script. And neither should Sean Bean. The other two could have taken it or left it. Really, it will make you feel claustrophobic, if you do get claustrophobic on planes, but otherwise, it's not really worth seeing 
 This book is horrible at treating the factor of history.  This is only a theological treatise about Christ's work of salvation.  If we look at the Bible (both in the Old Testament and the New Testament), historical context is important.  Prof. Morris should talk a little bit more about the Jewish guilt in killing Christ and what consequences that has.  Prof. Morris denies the whole prophetic tradition in ignoring this important element.  Thus, this book is neither wholly biblically-centered or beneficial to the long-term goals of the Christian church in light of the Word of God 
 I purchased this book because I thought it was a revised and expanded edition of the Joy of Cooking book I already have and enjoy. The REVISED and EXPANDED words on the cover lead me to believe I was purchasing even more and different recipes than the original, but it is the exact book! I also purchased the other one stating the same misleading words in bold print on the cover. I am very disappointed and cannot return them because I didnt make this discovery within the 30 day limit. I believe it should be clearly stated that these are merely paperback editions of the hard back Joy of Cooking which I have purchased several copies as gifts for family and friends as it is a wonderful cookbook 
 It's a technical analysys book that employs a lot of wrong assumptions in order to build a trading system.  For instance, it says about 4.5 years, 18 months, and 52 weeks market cycles in order to time the market, which is impossible.  Waste of time 
 First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book,  each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.  What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of "telephone."   You know "telephone" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?  Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.  While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts 
 I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth 
 Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!) 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I read this book a few years ago as part of my Master's degree program in American History.  It's the most impenetrable gobbledygook I've ever read; a great example of how too much history is being written for other PhDs, though I doubt if any PhD other than Wilentz understands it.  Don't waste your time unless you need further proof that Wilentz in more interested in political grandstanding than writing good history 
 As a careful student of scripture who uses scripture to explain scripture, I was severely disappointed by this book. A single example will serve to show why everyone should avoid this work.  The Seals, Trumpets, and Bowls take up 11 of the 22 chapters of the book of Revelation. They are saturated with Old Testament quotations and allusions. Yet LaHaye doesn't use a single Old Testament passage to help him explain these three series. This is completely inexcusable. But even more, when he considers the first horseman (the first Seal), he completely ignores Revelation's own use of the symbolism of "white robes" and the "crown" (Greek: stephanos, the crown given to the righteous). By doing this, he turns the meaning of this symbol completely on its head.  No one should read this book for anything other than a good example of how not to read the Bible 
 This is a piece of junk. My husband and I went to set it up to surprise our son and had it back in the box before he ever saw it. It is not worth the money 
 A thriller that offers obvious leads to obvious ends with occasional punches direcltly to a woman's face. The themes of the film (passion, obsession, jealousy, insanity vs sanity) would have been much better served if at least SOME of the situations or characters in this film were a BIT more sympathetic. (WARNING - there are spoilers ahead!)  Csokas' character Cleave is so one dimensional, so uninteresting, and so wooden you wonder what richarson's Stella ever sees in him.  OK - there is an underlying Russell Crowe/Brendon Frazier primal urgency that may have interested her at first.  But the man is a bore.  Worse, he's an obvious true lunatic who is said to have murdered his wife, decapitated her, scalped her, then hacked at her face like the clay he feebly molds as a failed artist.  Even if Stella had volcanic orgasms with this guy, wouldn't she have been a bit more apprehensive about continuing, and renewing, this relationship over and over and over again?  Ian McKellen remains a joy to watch.  His well contained performance is all in his eyes. A performance that begs us to question the line between neurosis and true insanity.   Ultimately the film is unsatisfying. Stella is so wretched - ultimately spacing out while watching her son drown leading to his death - viewers can only feel relief when she falls to her ultimate Hitchcockian vertiginous doom. Even here, we're reminded of what the master director knew; there is more to fear in what is unseen, rather than what is actually seen.  Though we get to watch Edgar pummel her, at least we're spared the indignity of watching him hack her to pieces.   Worth the 3.50 it's selling for on Amazon. But not with the added costs of shipping 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 Scientology is a dangerous cult and Szasz is one of its biggest supporters. And some believe you should just change your lifestyle and you can rid yourself of Cancer, too.  Most rational scientists and mental health providers know that many different types of therapy--changing personal conduct as well as medicine and therapy--work, oftentimes very well together. Beware ANYONE who says: This is the only way 
 No matter who is in the cast, it would be hard to outshine the Peter O'Toole/Katherine Hepburn "Lion in Winter" -- even if Hepburn is Hepburn as always.    This new version comes nowhere near.  Visually it's somewhat better -- the detail on costumes, props, and sets is fascinating.  But poor Patrick Stewart, poor Glenn Close (who I normally adore!), poor cast -- abysmal.  The three princes are awful, and Jonathan Rys-Myers -- well, he should have passed on this one.  He's very talented, but it doesn't show here.  I have to confess I didn't even finish watching it.  It just doesn't work.  This is another remake that should never have been remade!  
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 This is an extremely superficial book. While the premise is good, the arguments are poorly developed. The author obviously wrote it to cash in on his notoriety from the OJ case 
 The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.  My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did.   I have not found a place to order replacement parts.     
 This book is a collection of Q & A's where Donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems. Although some generalizations can be made from the problems included, it's hard to know how to generalize--i.e. whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case. This means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog's behaviour. If you have a serious problem, don't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes 
 abandon this book and get eckehard shultz's a students grammar of MSA. It is far superior to this book in every way: it is more concise, the examples are much more pertinent and plentiful, the printing and paper is better so the type (both english and arabic) is much easier on the eyes, and the concepts are explained in straightforward, easy to understand english, punctuated with excellent examples for all grammatical situations, none of which are archaic and outdated. This book sucks. It will waste your time and have you re-reading passages. Shultz's is the way to go, no question 
 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 I watched this movie and I have no idea what it was about. Admittedly it had the usual post-modern, post-Matrix action movie tropes, improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things (I'm a big fan of Charlize Theron in a sheer body suit), lots of explosions, a vast, behind the scenes conspiracy (well, that's kind of redundant, most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the Imperial Storm Troopers in Star Wars look like Marine snipers, but other than that what was this movie about? It's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes, throw them up against the wall, see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results. What comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand. "Aeon Flux" is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with better looking actors and a huge production budget. Well no, it's not even that, say what you will about Ed Wood, he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them, but it's doubtful that anyone involved in "Aeon Flux" viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck, and it shows. Save your money, in a few years this will be on Showtime late at night as a replacement for "Beastmaster III" and if you're up late you can watch it then 
 It has all the right elements: Nazi conspiracies, international intrigue, duplicity galore...but they simply don't gel together in the breathtaking way I've come to expect from a Ludlum novel.  The back cover blurb about the August 1991 attempted coup in Moscow initially caught my attention, so I bought it and eagerly dug in.  No suspense.  No edge-of-my-seat anticipation.  I remained quite firmly in my comfy chair.  I repeated "there has got to be more about the coup in here somewhere" so often that it became a mantra to keep me from throwing the book away in frustration.  There were about 20 pages worth of material on the coup.  I could do better than that just by having watched it on CNN.  Interesting book, yes.  Worthy of the Robert Ludlum name?  A most definite no.  I noticed that the ghostwriter's name appears nowhere on/in the cover, nor on Amazon's entry.  That should be a telling clue in itself 
 This product works well when I use it with a curling iron.  The low rating is for the cost.  I just don't think it is worth over $20 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion.  In that I was successful.  It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.  I needn't have worried.  There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless.  I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, "Does he even *like* these characters?"  It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.  Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 Very Vanilla sounding throughout - like so much of today's general music. Why it was Rolling Stones' number one for Oct 19 2006 I don't know, there are better CDs.  Where is the originality?  Where are the catchy melodic musical hooks? Whole thing sounds like a Michael Jackson voice imitation, esp "Damn Girl."  Very monotone throughout with one song running into another without excitement.  Overall a boring album.  JT can do better. I think the guy has talent but he needs some good songs (words), sound engineering (mix), and a great backup band or music with "jump in your face" hooks - stuff that says "I'm Different" from the pack.  He needs to avoid this "common sounding" trend, and stand out from the crowd.  But I guess this is what the public is buying these days since he was number one, or maybe they had no real option out there (too much of this type music exists).  But how about making music that stands the test of time?  Who will listen to this album in ten years?  Will any one "given song" actually survive the test of time?  Unfortunately I think not.  Too bad.  The guy can do much better.  I guess we have surrendered to massive CD sales to 12 year olds and forgotten artistic perspectives and real creativity. If you are a true musician, you will agree and push JT to seek out his true potential more. I'm rooting for you JT.  Go for it 
 I'm relatively new to eclipse and I really like the idea of slim books - I like distilled cut-to-the chase books.  Dr. Carlson's book is concise, clear, succinct and packed with useful information for the Java developer.  But, there is one gigantic omission... The source code he uses and references in the example that runs through out the book is missing.  I've looked to no avail. I hope that the author corrects this with a posting of the source on the web 
 I gave two stars to this movie for exactly two benefits I gained from watching it.  These benefits are illustrated by the next two paragraphs.  There is absolutely beautiful cinematography.  Depictions of Provence, a region of France adjacent to both the Mediterranean Sea and Italy, were bountiful and beautiful.  Director Ridley Scott's showcasing of the scenes representing Provence is enough to make one consider clicking the "complete order" button for a 14-day European vacation extravaganza.  That catchy little tune by Alizee, "Moi Lolita", made a brief appearance in the movie which catapulted the song back into my consciousness.  The song, of course, is one of many attempts by the media to capitalize on the cultural sensation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, "Lolita", but that is another story entirely.  *plot summation information below*  The essence of the story is the tired cliché of greedy, amoral pig finding meaning, love, and purpose via the simple equation of:  abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful French countryside = happiness.  Max (Russell Crowe) is a wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker, who never met a market he didn't want to manipulate.  Following a particularly successful business adventure, his assistant clues him in to the possibility that he is at risk of being investigated by the trade regulatory commission.  As a partial solution, she and his superiors recommend that he take a temporary leave of absence from the company, preferably out of the country, until the heat dies down.  As luck would have it, Max's uncle recently died in Provence, and since he left no will, the winery previously under his care is automatically bequeathed to Max, as he is the closest known relative.  *end plot summation information*  Many have complained about the sheer predictability of the plot, and that is definitely a negative aspect of this film, but not necessarily a terminal one.  What did kill my enjoyment of the film is the utterly nonsensical editing.  Scenes flash by without any semblance of explanation.  Cut to a conversation, seemingly for no reason at all, explain nothing, and then cut do the next scene just as one is beginning to soak up the scenery.  Include several characters in scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason for their placement there.  Speed up the action in one or two semi-montage scenes in the vein of a physical-comedy film, with no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution.  Finally, splice in a post-"fin" scene which could only be described as surreal.  In essence, this movie was 200 mini-films spliced into one.  At least, that's the impression I got, and it totally destroyed my suspension of disbelief.  There are other negatives:  the lame stereotyping (of secretaries, of Americans, of European humor), plots that go nowhere ("good"/"bad" wine secret "conspiracy"), and humor attempts which can only be labeled as "wince-inducing", among many, many other detrimental attributes.  Romantic comedy lovers:  this is neither romantic nor funny, so if you just HAVE to see the handsome Russell Crowe or the beautiful Marion Cotillard, buy a poster instead. "Gladiator" or "Black Hawk Down" fans:  no, even with the breakneck editing, it is still not an action movie. Scenery fans:  turn off the audio, fast-forward to the "scenery" scenes, and keep the Semillon flowing...I would recommend three bottles per person.  Not even worth renting, unless your friend has already rented it, AND you have cleaned all the gunk you could reasonably be expected to clean out of your fingernails already 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 I started to read it.  I tried and tried, but in the end I gave it up.  Maybe I don't have the "intellectual equipment" to understand this book, or most of the other fraudulent tripe of that era.  I felt ashamed of myself for a while - until I found this gem in the Penguin edition of Somerset Maugham's "The Summing up" (page 60):  "It is strange that one can ever have admired that prose.  It does not flow.  There is no air in it.  A careful mosaic constructed by someone without great technical skill to decorate the walls of a station dining room.  Pater's attitude towards the life around him, cloistered, faintly supercilious, gentlemanly, donnish in short, repels me.  Art should be appreciated with passion and violence, not with a tepid, deprecating elegance that fears the censoriousness of a common-room.  But Walter Pater was a feeble creature: it is unnecessary to condemn him with intensity."  Alright, I'm a philistine for not enjoying "Marius", but I can take some comfort in being in excellent company. 
 There are alot of good tips in this book, however it is poorly organized.  I felt like I was reading a church cookbook, where everyone submitted something and everything was included, even if the same thing had already been said 10 times.  It is very frustrating to read 
 Here's the deal, ladies... you want to respect your husband? Respect him by having the decency to have a "head" of your own and to not read this book. A good Christian knows that God embraces all of us as His children, and that does not require half of us to mindlessly obey the other half.  As for this book, it is great for a laugh. The author is obviously delusional snd thoroughly brainwashed. I myself barely made it through the first few pages, and had to force myself to keep reading just for the shock value 
 This pitter is a nice looking stainless steel pitter. If you don't mind wasting your money, this pitter is for you. After pitting a pound of cherries, effortlessly, the pitter's pin stopper broke....which meant the cherries had to be pulled off of the pin, slowing pitting. It was, pardon the pun, the pits 
 This work represents all that is wrong with certain elements of the liberal establishment.  Instead of acknowleding what's good in the Church, they insist on continuing their campaign of hatred against one of the remaining bastion of decency in this world...But again it is so fashionnable to be anti-catholic in certain groups nowadays.. 
 I've never read such a poorly written and researched book in my entire life. The author is a complete revisionist. He has such a poor knowledge of History it boggles the mind!   Readers!- Save your money and search out better resources concerning the subject matter. 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books 
 I agree with the above comments...all one sees is a black cover.  The book looks/sounds interesting, but there is no table of contents or example of what is inside the book.  This book needs to present more information if you expect one to buy 
 Major disappointment. Probably a ton of good content. But the little stick drawings of plants, at best, and no drawings a lot, for most, is a real let down 
 The only thing exciting about the book is the title.  I could not wait to get the book and read it.  I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever.  There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole.  I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off 
 I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did  nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!! 
 The information in this book is accurate and presented clearly, but the techniques and recipes are extremely basic and boring.  I won't need to refer to it for reference and thus won't be keeping my copy.  Incidentally, no guidelines or plans are given for anything like the stone stove shown in the cover photo.  Since that's such an attractive set-up, I think it's misleading to not include info on it in the book 
 I dislike purchasing books that offer more in the title than they deliver.  I would have preferred more specifics in this book than narrative generalities.  B/W photos were poor.  The promised section on booth design left me with more questions than answers. This book offers nice filler information, but if you're looking for nuts and bolts, look elsewhere 
 Not are the recepies similar to each other, most of them are not very good. Grapefruit - excellent Rosmary - OK Tangerine Brandy - Ghastly Better books are available 
 A shining star in the quest for the most incomplete work ever published by credible institutions, David Griffiths triumphs over both the competition and his other works with his widely-distributed Third Edition of Introduction to Electrodynamics.  The useful life of this book is 6 months, as that is how long it takes physics students to complete the intermediate level sequence on electricity and magnetism. Because most of the meaningful content of this book that would make it (at least) more complete gets reproduced by teachers in classroom lectures, both graduate students and undergraduate students must redo homework problems, never again to know if their answer is correct, in reassurance that they still know the concepts that they were taught months or years ago. Even the few sections of the book with worded analysis instead of mathematical analysis depend so strongly on the mathematics once again that without a complete word-based definition and explanation, no student can sit down with the book for any less than 30 minutes at a time to identify and restudy key concepts. In fact, the only chance that students have of cutting out 29 of those 30 minutes is by looking at the formulas in the front and back covers of the book, many (particularly those in the back) of which students should already have memorized from completing the sequence. If only Griffiths would add "By looking in the back of the book" before spitting out "Easy" or "Obviously" every few sections, students would not be so nearly put down by such a travesty of a science textbook.  The impossibility for students to learn from the hundreds of missing steps in derivations throughout the book (which you get to see in their entirety for the price of your tuition), the lack of page references or useful word-based explanations of terms, and Griffith's "obvious" attitude problem serve to make Introduction to Electrodynamics the worst book ever 
 I have used the recipes in this book and they work pretty well with the Sourdough starter from King Arthur Flour - I then purchased some starters from Ed Wood and followed the instructions in the book.  When they did not revive (they came dried) his basic reply was "tough" even though they claim you will get a refund.  Since the book is an infomercial for his starters I would think they would be a little more friendly! 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 Atlantis: Milo's Return plays out more like three saturday morning cartoon episodes that they added interconnecting scenes to. It has the poor quality of the average saturday morning toons.   This is not really much of a sequel. They present three seperate, unrelated tales of misadventure that Milo and the gang have to go through. Sure, they are all related to artifacts that were created by the king of Atlantis, but that's about it.   Poorly conceived, blandly presented, and with an ALL NEW VOICE for Milo (they obviously couldn't get Michael J. Fox back for this due to the poor quality), the standard Disney trademark is on this when everything turns out perfectly peaceful in the end.  Kids might enjoy it, but Scooby Doo at its worst is more entertaining 
 Carly's book was "ok". She cries alot, triumphs, and blames many around her. This one is definitely skippable 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There was absolutely no plot. Nothing. It was a complete waste of my time and taught me nothing about the Cuban experience in NYC. I love most Cuban movies, and all movies by this director. But, el Super was horrible 
 I agree with some of the other negative reviews of this album about it sounding way too tinny.  I am a big fan of lo-fi music, but this is no-fi music.  The louder I turned it up, the worse it sounded.  I have given it several listens, but have found nothing redeeming about it, other than it is so mellow and droning(in a bad way) that its easy to fall asleep too.  There is much, much better music from this genre.... I don't want anyone to make the same mistake that I did 
 The Answers to the questions are wrong!!  For Examples - they state the largest lake in the WORLD is Lk. Superior.. Nope, Caspian Sea.  (Please look up the word lake!! 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 Well, I suppose if you're a parent that has only been to Disneyland and never outside the U.S. yourself, this will be a godsend. Otherwise, you'll find the author both simplistic and attempting to be intellectual in a cutesy sort of way (why the postmodern touch of not capitalizing any section titles?)  My Romanian husband (both of us are academics) are taking my nine year old to Turkey, Romania, Hungary, and points along the way this spring, so I thought this would offer some pointers (nope!).  In the description, of course, the point that these EU countries were excluded from the author in lieu of tourist traps like Paris was not revealed. I'm taking my son to Transylvania, and reselling the book for more than I paid, thank you 
 It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey. 
 I dont think the other reviewers are quite accurate in their assessment of this text.  The book does offer many examples, and the pseudocode is very helpful in implementing these methods.  The real problem with this book is that many of the explanations of the methods are written in pseudocode.  This makes learning the concepts extremely confusing and difficult, as they are written in code.  The proofs are helpful, but with the confusing notation in iterative methods, there is no way near enough information to correctly learn what is going on.  I took this class in graduate school and never used the book unless I wanted to see some code.  My advice: Take notes from the professor, and if you need to code up a method, go to the library and copy down what you need.  A VERY poor teaching aid 
 I read this book two years ago hoping that it will give me an insight and an interesting frame of reference for my thesis. I was disappointed. The only aspect I found useful was the information on the different policies of assimilation of the Turkish minority during Communism 
 I am astonished that this book might be the support material of a Harvard course... First of all, there is a massive mistake on the backcover of the book "Jean-Francois Le Pen" is in fact "Jean-Marie Le Pen". It is such an obvious mistake - it looks like a joke ! But OK, let's admit it's only a translation mistake, it doesn't change the overall quality of the book.  Just to let you know, the author is part of the left side of the french left wing - She is a typical example of the generation of "soixante-huitard" french intellectuals, who use to support the maoism if not the stalinism. 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 Is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects 
 They should have titled it "Locked in the Arms of a Terrible Author." That would have been a more fitting title for this aweful book 
 Whoever threw this collection of albumcovers together, obviously wanted to make a book showing a few albumcovers, but had no clue what new wave was. Neither a classic like Roxy Music belongs in this book, nor all the unimportant american power pop bands a la photos,heaters etc, that nobody listened to and that didnt contribute anything new or of value to the music scene. Even worse, adding idols for 12 year olds, such as Wham, Taco, Men without hats and similar crap to this collection, is an iinsult to the genre. Those we the ones we hated and never wanted t see again, if you had been born then already, you know 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 This is a difficult book to read, not for its content but for the way is presented. I started reading this book since February and still (November)can`t find reasons to continue. There is a lot of great details and information but is all over the place. Mr. Galeano is obviously anti and he feel like the vast mayority of the problem that Latin America has faced thru the years are American made. Next time, I will try to read the Spanish version, hopefully it would be easier to digest 
 One of the funniest things about Techgnosis: Myth, Magic + Mysticism in the Age of Information, Erik Davis's much-ballyhooed 1999 release, was how it skewed the conventions of ' Frisco technological mysticism, managing to be distinctively perverse in a world already saturated with impenetrable tech writing and books with incredibly long and pretentious titles. At times the writing was laborious - tedious psychedelic musings, as Davis' Neo-geek garb, pseudo-intellectual facial hair, and droning point of view plugged you into the visionary amorality of robots. With its oft-seen spiritual imagery and techno-porno bent, Techgnosis: Myth, Magic + Mysticism in the Age of Information finds Davis thin and wandering, blowing ploys that never worked before anyway - long words that no one is meant to understand, echoes of better writing, loose jamming that should have been edited into non-existence.  (...)  Sure, there are moments - the spine features an amazing font, the index is beautifully alphabetised and the Introduction admirably sums up Davis's creed ("Use words with a silent G and you'll surely alienate the unwashed masses"). A shuffling, upbeat passage of silly suppositions and the best use of Xena, Warrior Princess references since The Simpsons, the Intro expresses a bare logic of desire ("I want people to think that I'm smart, but also cool") that makes reading it seem as fun as sticking rusty nails into your eyeballs. Chapter 1's miasma begins with 'a completely generalised statement about humanity', which starts out as fine, brain-twisting, leather-elbow-patch academia, but loses it after Davis uses the words Dionysian, Apollonian and Bacchantes in the same sentence. I haven't been able to get through the rest of the book without nodding out - the distinct lack of clarity is pleasant enough, but I expected more.  Unlike Margaret Wertheim or Richard Coyne, Davis hasn't figured out that a successful Techno-spiritual fusion requires brevity. The great bits here - mystery of faith, cliched exploration of tech-angst, an endearing lack of direction- are overwhelmed by ego-driven writing, ambiguous references to overtly obscure source material. Two-thirds of the way through, Techgnosis: Myth, Magic + Mysticism in the Age of Information starts reading like a fourteen-hour layover in Kashmir, a long-distance runaround with only Wired magazine and a pack of purple Bubblicious to pass the time.  (... 
 I bought this book because it's a Six Sigma Handbook, but unfortunately it is not, is a book of SPC, it has a lot about control charts, run charts, etc. about hypothesis testing just a little!, anyway. I have to select better my books 
 Lots of specific workouts, and specific topics like advice for pregnant women, those with arthritis, etc. Very little background or general topics, like how many reps is best, etc. It felt constraining. Also, virtually nothing on weight machines - the workouts use free weights only 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 Jill Ann Spaulding claims to have read Playboy since she was a child, around 1980.  As an adult, she collected Playboy covers and sought out the models to sign them.  If she ever bothered to READ any of the issues, especially the anniversary issues, she would have learned that Hef had romantic involvements (sex) with Playmates CONSTANTLY, ever since the magazine was founded.  And then, at age 30 or 31, she becomes obsessed with becoming a Playmate and living at the mansion, despite the fact that she's been living with her boyfriend of 11 years.    So she sends nude photos to Hefner and wangles an invite to the mansion.  And she's shocked, SHOCKED, when she finds that Hef's having UNPROTECTED SEX with ALL of the girlfriends that he's photographed with month after month.  THEN the author continues to beg to be invited to parties, etc., and sends Hef gushing notes and presents to his girlfriends.  She spends most of the book talking about meeting celebrities and how beautiful she is.  Memo to Jill Ann: In 2006, a "girlfriend" by definition is someone you have sex with.  If a man is photographed month after month in public in the company of ALL his girlfriends AT THE SAME TIME, it's a pretty safe bet that they get in bed together at the same time also.  You wanted to go to mansion parties and you got to.  Hef likes having multiple girls at a time and you aren't into that. Hef was considerably more gracious to you than I would have been.  You claim to be a great poker player who wins tournaments.  Would you expect to enter a tournament without paying the entry fee 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire.  
 Almost 10 years later... and I am still waiting for the punchline.  I think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is:  it lacks ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and groove that marked most of the prior three albums.  It's what the forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been... "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK".  The songs are lackluster, but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album.  "No Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album.  "Waiting for the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work.  In this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums, respectively 
 I guess there's a reason why we're supposed to care about Horowitz's journey from Maoist to right-wing hack, but I didn't discover it in this tiresome book. If people are interested in some reminiscing of sixties radicalism, and the issues people who battle the establishment (not serve it) face, I'd recommend the DVD, "The Weather Underground. 
 Garbage metal - music for the American mainstream to feed on.  I saw them open for Slayer about 4-5 years back, and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except JUMPING UP AND DOWN.  How pathetic !   Pick up some real metal.... like old Kreator.  
 I was THRILLED to learn a hard bound volume was available to replace my ancient paperback.  But then I received the book and began rereading it...  Half way through, it is falling apart.  (I don't abuse books by a long shot.)  Be aware that the rather steep price will bring you a shrink-wrapped volume, with no dust cover, that is NOT a properly bound book.  The printing, too, is sub-par. ... (Get the new paperback!  Great edition of a wonderful story! 
 Even before I got to the ending I didn't think the story made any sense.  Way too many gaping holes in logic and believable behavior. Then I finished it and nearly threw it in the fireplace. HOW STUPID! It would have been more believable if aliens had been introduced at the end 
 I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough 
 I'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and I'm even less interested when they deal with children. Children in peril is not entertaining. That said, however, I picked up "Rage" at the airport. And thus, my first Jonathan Kellerman novel.  This was a dumb story and far from believable. I could not suspend disbelief. If you read mysteries, the bad guy screams "IT'S ME! IT'S ME!" in the first 30 pages. I was hoping I was wrong, but unfortunately, that was not the case. So, I tagged along and watched Alex and Milo chase obvious red herrings, useless leads, eat some donuts, theorize and solve the mystery!  I cannot mention how bad I thought the story was without giving away the plot, but let's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years.   I'll try an earlier J. Kellerman book. Maybe it will be better 
 I was totally disappointed in this book.  Totally predicatable. Major disappointment! 
 I bought one of the Brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on February 1, 2007), based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time.  Initially, I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly.  Instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm, my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms.  This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use.    I contacted Brookstone Customer Service to request a replacement part (I needed two right-hand pedals) the evening I received the shipment.  I had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal.  When, at one point, I mentioned simply returning the exercise bike, the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because--as I waited for the new part--I'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy!  With the new pedal finally in place, I immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed (though, unfortunately, not surprised) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot.  The mini-bike is quite noisy and so far, I've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use--either on a rug or on linoleum.  As a result, I have to back it up against a desk, file cabinet, or bookcase to use.  This product has been a huge disappointment and I would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money--even at the reduced price--on this product.  
 Don't look to this book as a satisfactory introduction to Kalman Filters.  The authors seem to confuse summation with explanation -- this is a good review if you already know the material but it doesn't convey the concepts  very well.  I studied a 1993 edition of this book with Version 1.1 of the  software and the Fortran source code that was provided was incomplete.  I  see from the author's review that new source code in C has been added since  then so this may no longer be the case 
 This is a book for people who do NOT work on designing video devices.  If you want to build something based on this book, your design will most likely fail since there are many ERRORS in the book.  BUT if you want to FOOL your boss on some paper design or FOOL some employers to get a JOB, this is a book for you since it is easy to read and you don't need any knowledge beyond high school 
 After unpacking and assembling the Ab Chair Deluxe, I noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold. The digital read out display lite up all 8's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries. Every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit. I still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective. Get a ab chair, just NOT this one 
 I just purchased one of these, unseen, having had good luck with Schaum's outlines before.  I was shocked to see that it hasn't been updated since 1961!  That's 45 years McGraw-Hill.  Surely you've sold enough of these in the 34 printings to justify updating it a couple of times per century?  Most of the content looks current.  Some of it, for instance, how fatigue is calculated, sizing of bearings, safety factors, etc., is clearly outdated.  There may be other topics which are also outdated -- and this is the big problem -- you don't know which of your calculations is wrong when following this book.  For an engineer it isn't acceptable to hope your structural designs are safe, and citing a reference that hasn't been updated in almost half a century isn't going to be much of a defence if anything goes wrong.  While most of the material is probably still correct, using this book without knowing what is right and what is wrong would be a form of professional "Russian Roulette."  Machine design is still widely taught, in fact, ABET has increased the requirements for design content in mechanical engineering programs in recent years, increasing the potential market for a book like this.  It's too bad that McGraw-Hill doesn't recognize the market for a modern version of this book.  It would be very helpful to students and practicing engineers alike.  Due to the risks involved in using this old version, however, I don't recommend it 
 there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek 
 Many love the Quincunx, and more power to them; I only hope to help the book find the right reader. I was obviously the wrong one.  The book is indeed a reprise of Dickens, good and bad.   The bad: I found it verbose in the extreme. Palliser would never write one word when a hundred would do instead. This habit becomes especially irritating as he dwells on the squalor to which he dooms his main characters. He seems to enjoy torturing them at extravagent length; the book makes "Angela's Ashes" feel like "Annie" by comparison. As you flip forward looking for relief, you will find none.  Its plot is transparent and convoluted at the same time. You will quickly solve the basic mystery in the first hundred pages, but it will take you hours of note-taking to pin down the actual details, if you ever do. And like many nineteeth-century novels, the plot is often driven forward by the naive stupidity of its characters. Watching the John's mother foolishly walk into one legal or financial landmine after another, you may wish you could enter into the book to strangle the poor, brainless woman, putting a quicker end to her misery, and yours.  If you enjoy all the cliches of nineteenth-century British literature--futile court cases stretching over generations, the injustice of the law, extremes of social inequality, the hypocrisy and selfishness of the landed classes--then this book is for you. It sure wasn't for me 
 I was sorely disappointed in this book.  I went by other reader's recommendations and I'm at a loss as to why it's got a 5-star rating.  I was, and still am, looking for a source that will get past the theory & history and describe how to complete the process: What do you do after you've baselined & have to produce a build 
 Mr. Haqqani has dubious credentials as he has served in a number of very corrupt governments in Pakistan's problematic history. Although I agree with some of his views overall he has vested interests that do not allow him to be a honest contributor to Pakisan tumultous history 
 When David Rabe's play "Hurlyburly" opened on Broadway in August 1984, it was directed by Mike Nichols.  It ran for 343 performances -- a long Broadway run -- and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.  William Hurt was nominated for Best Actor in his role as Eddie.  Judith Ivey who recently appeared in the Clint Eastwood film "Flags of our Fathers" won the Tony as Featured Actress in a play.  The rest of the cast included Harvey Keitel as Phil, Cynthia Nixon as Donna, Ron Silver as Mickey, Jerry Stiller as Artie and Sigorney Weaver as Darlene.  It's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen.  With lead actors Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey & Anna Paquin, there are four Oscars to make this an award-winning cast.  Perhaps there is a great difference from a Mike Nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film Director Anthony Drazen who won the filmmaker's trophy @ Sundance for "Dramatic Zebrahead."  Whatever the reason, the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void.  It is hard to deny that Sean Penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today.  He won the Best Actor Award for this picture @ the Venice Film Festival.  As Eddie, he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker, snarls, cries & puts his hand in his pants.  Watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that William Hurt's on Broadway.  Penn is worth watching.  He's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star.  Kevin Spacey as the manipulative Mickey is hardly endearing.  Yes, compared the other guys he seems relatively together.  But his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay.  It leaves Spacey with a mono-level performance that, while interesting, does not move us because he doesn't change.  Chazz Palminteri as the gorilla-minded Neanderthal Phil that can't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious.  It's unclear why Eddie keeps him around.  Perhaps to feel that he's better than someone else, as the dialogue indicates.  But we don't really get that emotional need.  Thus when Phil drives off Mulholland, we're really just glad to be rid of him.  I agree that the women are the most likeable.  However, we fail to understand why they hang around these guys.  Robin Wright Penn's Darlene seems too bright & together to connect with Eddie.  As the waif Donna, Anna Paquin almost made me forget her Rogue character from the X-Men movies.  She is so vulnerable that I felt sorry for her.  As Bonnie, Meg Ryan takes the role that won Ivey the Tony, but we fail to understand why she is loose.  She doesn't seem like a girl who'd have such low standards.  The fact that she walks out on Eddie seems to confirm this.    Screenwriter David Rabe had worked with Penn in two other films, "State of Grace" & "Casualties of War."  While Penn comes off the best, the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the Hollywood hills, but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy.  It was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film.  I could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed, because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first 10 minutes.  So while this project may have been wonderful on Broadway, the film version nose-dived into oblivion.  Taxi! 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 This is another book by Borg that I would never purchase on my own.  Borg is a proud member of the Jesus Movement and it appears that their main goal is to discredit the Jesus of the Bible and remake Him in the mold of one of many spiritual people throughout history 
 I chose this film thinking it would be Mel Gibson when he was still good. Yes, he was good, but I'd seen it many years ago, when I was still at school, and didn't remember. Until I was watching the film and thinking that I'd already seen this before. I had an inkling that I'd already seen it, when the girl jumped off the building (I think I had a moan about why she had to be almost topless the first time round) and then Mel gets out of bed. I definitely remember that scene! Damn.   The thing about watching Lethal Weapon now, is that it's been either spoofed too many times or it's been copied so many times. Almost every 80s cop movie is like this. Good cop, bad cop. Neither wants a partner. Then they realise they can't work without each other. And it spawns some mediocre sequels. In the case of the spoofing, see Loaded Weapon, with Emilio Estevez and Samuel L Jackson.  There was nothing particularly stand out about this film - apart from Mel's hair, which was just awful - I liked the pairing of Mel & Danny, and I liked the albino Gary Busey, playing a bad guy, who doesn't even flinch at his arm getting burnt with a lighter. Ouch. The guy about to commit suicide from the top of the building and then having Mel's character handcuffed to him was the stand out scene for me, not including the opening scene.  The reason I'm only giving this 2 stars (which isn't going to go down to well with some reviewers) is because if I'd seen it when it originally came out, I probably could have given a higher rating. But we've seen it all before these days, and yes, it may have been a brilliant movie then, but not so much for me.   For me, I would like to see another sequel to this. Maybe Mel could grow his hair again? I mean, there is another Indiana Jones on the way, and another Die Hard. Lets revive Lethal Weapon shall we? You're never too old, as Harrison Ford is proving and Mel and Danny are both younger. They could still do it. Couldn't they? Maybe Mel could save his reputation.   Most reviewers consider this a classic, but in my case, it was worthy of a watch, but I don't remember being that impressed by it the first time round. (So much so that I didn't realise I'd already seen it!) If you saw it the first time, relive the happy memories, and watch it on HD, cos it amazing. (Bearing in mind I did see it on VIDEO, so anything is better than that. 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 if your an Danielle Steele fan this is right up there with all the other styleized reads. Mostly you can take any story. line and change names, and local, and you have the story.I will give it this much, the story was somewhat different but lets get real, can they all be that dumb??? I do give her E for effort 
 I guess if you find British Sci-Fi to be exciting and you think Dr. Who is the peak of their talent then this might entertain you.  Mr. Ward is out of place in this movie and by the end I was hoping the Aliens would have their way with all the cast members and put me out of my pain.  Not a good movie if you want original ideas, acting, or even basic special effects.  The series "Tri-Pods" was more orignal and entertaining...where did they go wrong with this one 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 Total garbage for anyone interested in learning how to draw. I think another reviewer said you'd be better off getting pictures off the Internet and copying those. That's correct. This book is of no value whatsoever. A coloring book teaches you more 
 I hated this book!  I thought that the heroine acted like an idiot.  Not that the hero didn't, both of them tried to be so upstanding and moral.  Give me a break!  This is a romance novel not a treatise on philosophy 
 yes, i bought this & read it. wel, it may make you feel less like it's "your fault!" if you're infertile, but it's important to know the facts. most women menstrate into their 50s, but become infertile between 38-42. your chances of conceiving w/ your own eggs, even with ivf, after 43 is like 0.02%, OR, in layman's terms, not good. NONE of these fertility books tell you that. and for every woman, like the author of "Inconceivable," which I also read, who conceive, literally hundreds more won't. the moviestars over 40, like Geena Davis, who you see in redbook, etc., are getting pregnant through IVF with DONOR eggs.  but they don't tell anyone, keeping the pregnant over 40 myth going.... i guess there's a lot o shame w/ infertility, which leads to people like me casting about for answers since "it worked for them," thinking, "if only i could drink as much wheatgrass as HER!!!" & "ooo! what's HER secret, and how much will she charge me for it?"  (bye the bye, i found the book "inconceivable" terribly upsetting and sad & not helpful. plus, she was trying for her 2nd baby, and hearing her whine feels like a slap when YOU think she's so lucky to even have 1!)  one "bit" of "magic" i did find... acupuncture. it regulated my cycle, and going twice a week can improve a man's sperm by 60% research shows. plus it's relaxing and AFFORDABLE, which Dr. Domar's programs (I live near her LA branch) aren't. otherwise, save your money, or join RESOLVE (www.resolve.org)and maybe you can "book swap" with fellow members... my best advice, go to a reproductive endocrinologist asap, & find out what's really happening. it set our minds at ease, even though all the news wasn't good. most importantly... strive to keep your relationship happy and loving and sexy.  hang in there; you have my entire sympathy & empathy. good luck & i wish all of us babies :) 
 Don't let this review get you down on the band. There is surely some good music here. But only on the opening of this CD. After that, its downhill. Nothing Horrible. Just not mentionable. Buy Yoshime if you want a Great CD. The newer Mystics is good, Soft B. should be a pickup (not the first one). Simple. Buy Yoshime. Its there best effort hands down. The others will follow. This one will not be played, unless you burn and take the first track off it. 
 this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project. There are no clif notes, spark notes, etc. for this book and there should be. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK! it has no twist, and i can't even imagine how there could be one, considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again. if you must read this book, i recommend some strong coffee and some valium 
 See my review of Stern's "Complete 'Jewish' Bible". This one is also utter nonsense. The man needs psychiatric help 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005 
 I'm reminded of the story of a well-known SF writer who as an experiment tried revising E.E. "Doc" Smith's galactic epics to remove the obsolete and clunky bits only to find he'd removed all the fun along with  them.  It's only by virtue of not tampering with the original text that  Benford avoids commiting the same fault but with premeditation.  Of course  "Against The Fall Of Night" is obsolete SF.  That doesn't matter.   What matters is its atmosphere, and it is this atmosphere that Benford  rejects systematically and irreverently.  Clarke might not have objected to  the changes, but authors view their works very differently than the readers  do 
 The packaging hadn't been so pathetic. The tiny pieces of styrofoam, that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping,  led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant. The cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame, and one of the pipes was broken and leaking. PLUS there was no crisper drawer included. I won't be buying a replacement from Sanyo!! 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you.  I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly.  Really quite silly.  I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you.  It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally.  Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying 
 I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! .. 
 I am SO disappointed with this vacuum!  I will say, it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet, but don't expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye!  Also, I have a cat - so I have pet fur on my carpet... AND I lose a lot of hair myself, and this vacuum doesn't pick any of that up... I can vacuum, run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair.   It would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet... it seems to do that very well, though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum, shake the filter out, etc, because it gets clogged VERY fast 
 I am studying calculus currently in my ap class. I bought this book. And I found out there are many misprints and errors there 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 You would think that you would buy and watch these seasons, but you just never put them in the DVD player.  What a waste of money 
 The book starts off with Ty describing her last day as a bartender.  As the book continues, you as the reader get a quick and dirty tour of how she started in the business, a sort of why she started, and then the narrative goes on to describe all kinds of different things she has seen/experienced in her years as a bartender.  Throughout the book there are little blurbs "Pet Peeves".  For someone married to a writer, one would think the book would have some polish and more of a "flow" to it.  As one reviewer put it "it comes across as a bunch of magazine articles scotch-taped together" A pretty accurate description.  Its fluff, not a lot of "behind the scenes" so much as one persons mostly dis-likes about the business.  She comes across as cynical and somewhat jaded.  Its interesting how she has a special place reserved in hell for a particular kind of woman, yet she also brazenly states she used whatever weapons she had (clothes no bigger than a belt, mat-gloss lipstick, etc) to get the customers money...the "grat" or tip.  She might as well have referred to them as "johns".  If you can buy it for under 5 bucks, maybe, but not worth the cover price 
 As a fan of Penn & Teller's other books, I was going to buy this, but in reading parts of it in a bookstore, I discovered that it's not the fun, clever, amusing book about tricks you could use to cheat at cards or even ways to have fun with your friends at a poker night.   This book is a dark and seedy account about the life of a professional (and possibly fictional) poker cheater.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it wasn't the book I thought it was going to be so I wanted to post a warning to make sure you knew what you were getting.

 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 Ok, I bit and bought a copy after seeing all the hype. I was disappointed to discover that it's not the book you are led to believe it is.  There's next to nothing in it about starting or running an online business. Now this is truly bizarre considering who the author is.   If you are looking at starting an old fashioned off-line type business, then it might be helpful. Suppose you wish to start a vacuum cleaner agency from your kitchen table or an mlm distributorship. Then I could see this being of some help. It's basically about all about dialling for donuts endlessly from home.  There's also very little of Gianforte in the book. Reading it you can't escape the conclusion that he farmed it out to his co-author, who then did all the work. Unfortunately the co-author is a journalist and not a businessman, so he focussed on the wrong things, in my opinion.  If you are looking at starting an online business, go with "Go Big or Go Home" by Wil Schroter. Now that's the book that deserves this one's hype 
 once again to slow but fast with pitch and bpm off sound rotation. not loud enough no consistent sound or evovled framework that i normally hear from this artist at live raw performances in dance trance genre. i mean this artist is the best but needs to fire the sound or cd production team if you were to hear or see what i see in live performance you kinda wonder why cant anybody bring that brilliance to cd for home use. a lot of good musicians dont have a clue what they are selling to the public because the master copy sounds different from what is being sold and that ofcourse comes from poor planning or bad management team. Dont get me wrong this musician/dj is off the hook but once agian this cd is embarassing and sounds bad i know i can get school kids to blare faster and better beats off a turn table burn it on cd and have all these so called music critics claim that it was the best meshed euphoric sound they have heard , serve the masses nonsense but never claim to understand proper dance forma 
 The zipper on these bags will not stay zipped, therefore the air will not stay out of the bag and the bag will not stay compressed.  The first time I tried to zip the bag, the zipper holder fell off.  I put it back on but it didn't help zip the bag.  I then zipped it by hand, making sure I tightly zipped every bit of the zipper. I used two extra large size bags, one for a queen size comforter and the other for 4 accent pillows.  Neither bag would stay zipped. They are a waste of money. 
 I've only watched the first six episodes so far, waiting for some in depth story to unfold with diverse characters... blah blah blah.  Nothing but a simple story line with everything spelled out.  There's no complexity to it, no unfolding of the characters, no mystery of peeling through the layers of their lives.  All the episodes seem so long and dragged out but nothing different ever really happens.  Boy tries to save girl, boy gets beat up, boy does what he feels is right without thinking it through, no strategy, no thought to his actions.  It almost seems like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes.  Another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil King Hamdo is such a whiny coward, but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects.  Somebody would have dethroned him by now, in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed, kill his guards, have him in there sights, and not only miss him, but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk.  The actions and reactions of this world are just to unrealistic.  I want my wasted hours back.  Good thing this only cost me twenty dollars  
 Ted Dekker is a total "hit or miss" with me. I began my foray into his work with Thr3e and literally could not finish the book. But, assured by a friend I trusted, I gave him another shot and picked up Black. I was not disappointed. The day I finished Black, I got Red and the day I finished Red, I began White. I absolutely loved The Circle Trilogy, so you can imagine my eagerness when I discovered Showdown, which is roughly a continuation of the Trilogy, centering around the mysterious Books of History which bring written words into real life.  Showdown begins with promise, builds weakly, and putters to a pathetic end. Is there any action in Showdown? Plenty, I suppose. Actually, Showdown is a fairly gory and violent story. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of maybe 15. If it were to be made into a movie as written, it would be rated "R", "PG-13" at the least.  The story is about a tiny, isolated town in Colorado. It literally has one grocery store, one church, one beauty shop, and once had a movie theater. The town of Paradise (such an awfully cliche' name, all things considered) has a population of about 400, but we only really get the feeling that it's populated by about twenty. The remaining population are only briefly referenced a few times, which skews the feel of the story, in my opinion.  The opening scene is pretty good, actually. Johnny Drake, a boy of about fourteen, is sitting with his old (very old) friend Cecil as a stranger decked out in what can only be described as a gunslinger's getup from a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western, strides into town on foot. Marsuvees Black is an outlaw prophet come to Paradise to bring the sleeping residents a message of "grace and hope" and to shake things up a little.  In the first few pages, Black murders 80 year old Cecil by scaring him into a heart attack and Johnny Drake is the only witness. From this point forward, young Johnny is the only person in Paradise who is able to resist the charms and deceptions Black brings to the town.  Beginning at the Episcopal church that night, Black calls a town meeting where he wows the people with a sleight-of-hand show that really gets everyone's attention. Who doesn't like to be entertained at church, after all? He openly challenges the pastor, Father Stanley Yordon, who leaves almost immediately the following day for a conference with the Bishop in Denver and does not return for several days. I was fully expecting Stanley to return and do something of consequence, but in all fairness to the story, he was absolutely useless as a character except that Dekker needed a church and a church needs a pastor. Well, and there's the affair with Johnny's mother, Sally. And their child. I won't spoil that should anyone reading this actually decide to read Showdown. Still, it really didn't add to the story.  After getting to very briefly (and shallowly) know the characters in Paradise, we move to a mysterious monastery where a group of orphans are attending a special school. In reality, they are the unknowing participants in a spiritual experiment organized by the headmaster, David Abraham (yes, just like Abraham in the Bible). It turns out that Marsuvees Black is one of the monks "teaching" the 37 or so students at the school. The students are taught primarily through writing. Everything centers around writing and for good reason: the mysterious blank Books of History we first hear about in The Circle Trilogy have appeared here. If you were perplexed by Dekker's ending in White, you will now solve the mystery of who Billy is. Billy is a thirteen or fourteen year old "orphaned" student at the seminary who is an exceptional thinker and writer.  In fact, his only real challenger is Samuel Abraham, the son of the headmaster.  We learn that there are forbidden tunnels under the monastery and that Billy has been tempted by Black to enter them where he discovers the blank Books of History. (The Books of History have he ability to create history based on whatever is written in them, so long as the writer has "the faith of a child", which, given the age of the children, was a bit unconvincing to me.  Whoever has seen a preteen who was filled with nothing more than angst and sarcasm?) Billy also discovers the giant worms (which are never really explained) that live in the tunnels and excrete a hallucinogenic sludge that seems to help blind him to the evil lurking about. In time, Billy begins to coerce his friends to visit the forbidden tunnels, which finally leads to a "debate" (one of the many "showdowns" of the book and just about the weakest "debate" I've ever read), resulting in a drastic change in the way the monastery operates. A majority of the students follow Billy down into the dungeons and are conscripted into helping him write his story. A story about an evil prophet who visits a sleepy little town called Paradise, Colorado...  I won't belabor on with more details, except to point out that the story is just incredibly weak. The characters are extremely shallow and the circumstances are just too unbelievable, even as a supernatural fantasy/thriller. Dekker does a poor job creating characters you care about, which is surprising because he did such a good job of that very thing in The Circle Trilogy. Several characters are brutalized, some are murdered, and I found I just didn't care. I felt I was just reading words on a page (actually at the half way point of the book, I was seriously wondering whether I would even bother finishing it. It did get better after that point, but only just.)  One big problem I had was how unusually remote the town was.  It just didn't make sense when the phones went out and the power failed that SOMEBODY didn't notice.  Don't these folks have families?  If you live in a remote area, aren't there like REGULAR deliveries or some sort of near DAILY contact made?  What about law enforcement?  Heck, what about the MAIL?!  The central message of Showdown is actually very good and full of meaning to Christians. "Grace and Hope without Love is powerless." In the end, sacrificial love is what saves the day. But his way of telling the story--of illustrating the power of love--had no power. Young Samuel's selfless act in the end meant absolutely nothing because he had nothing invested and therefore, nothing risked; no real reason to give his life to save the people of Paradise (or his "dear friend" Johnny), and without that very important connection, it had virtually no meaning for me and therefore no power. Words on a page.  I felt I had been beat over the head with allegory instead of told a fascinating tale about characters I cared about and those wonderful blank books. I didn't even hate the villains! How can you not at least hate the villains?! Lack of good character development really hampered the story. Dekker does a passable job with dialog, although he has the fourteen year olds sounding like eight year olds at times, and like proper Victorian ladies at other times. Who winks anymore? If I see a fourteen year old kid winking at another kid, I'm calling the cops.  I also found his use of everyday language in the narration to be annoying.  It almost read like a fourteen year old had written it. Hmmm...  The biggest problem I had with the story is the way the extreme conflicts were resolved.  Far too trite and fatalistic, in my opinion.  There's just no tension without risk, and NO risk where fate is concerned.  Well, they were "fantastic" in a sense and would look cool on a movie screen (anybody see a pattern here?), but they just didn't make much sense. Dekker seems to draw out the story with a few "key" revelations that don't make sense, either.  Yes, the revelations themselves made sense, I guess, but why his characters kept them hidden until "everyone was ready" did not. It became clear that he needed to push the plot and stretch the story.  Big mistake, in my opinion.  It subtracted credibility from his characters and from him as an author.  As I said, I absolutely LOVED The Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, and White), but I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time reading Showdown. On a scale of one to five, I rate it a solid two. (Hey, at least I finished it! I couldn't finish Thr3e!)  It's obvious Ted Dekker is a good writer from The Circle Trilogy.  Why he didn't put those same skills to use in Showdown is the biggest mystery of all 
 I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as "KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this world a better place!"  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review 
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 This book may be challenging for infants, but for my intelligence, i found the game boring 
 I really wanted to like this book because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Peters and Lynda Robinson and am always looking for more mysteries based in Egypt. But Haney just isn't a good enough or sophistsicated enough writer to pull this off and I found the book much too long and tedious. Her descriptions were so overly-written as to be confusing. Lt. Bak is too undeveloped to be a compelling main character - all he seems to do is worry and I had a picture of him throughout wringing his linen hankie and frowning. Her dialogue is in places laughable - I doubt even the ancient Egyptians spoke in metaphores and similes or used the purple prose Haney puts in their mouths.  Haney shows herself to be an amateur fiction writer by assigning action to body parts, which unfortunately is also one of my pet peeves. Yet there were so many eyes darting, glancing, gazing steering, taking on a life of their own I sometimes thought I was in the middle of an occular replacement convention. Where did Haney and her editor learn the basics of decent fiction writing? Haney's plot development is ponderous and the outcome is obvious early on. The motivation behind the murder bordered in my opinion on the juvenile. Haney makes a major faux pas - I won't say what it is because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone else but it's something no author should ever, ever do unless it is absolutely necessary. And in this case, it wasn't. If you want to read this book, get it from the library. Sorry, I don't usually write such harsh reviews but this is one author I can honestly say I won't read again 
 Disclaimer: I am not a fan of Larry Summers.  I didn't care for him when I was an intern at Treasury, and as an alum I really don't care for him as president of Harvard.  But even I think this book is unfair to Summers and goes too far in trying to villify the man.    Bradely has written a book that is very easy to read and draws almost all of the issues enveloping Harvard in easy to digest, black-and-white dramas between Summers (always in the black hat) and various members of the faculty and student body (always portrayed sympatetically).  This book makes no pretence of being objective or looking any further than skin-deep at the controversies that surrounded Summers before the most recent blow-up over his comments on women in science.  Several chapters end with essentially the same line: by doing X, Summers had further consolidated his rule over the university.  If all of this is true (it's not), Summers would be the absolute dictator of Harvard Yard by now.  In fact, what has been written here is basically an expanded, book-edition copy of the Harvard Crimson from 2000 to the present.  There is little new in the book that readers of Harvard's student newspaper don't already know other than a few re-interviews that Richard Bradley has done with various personalities involved in the recent events at Harvard.    What's lost here is that what is going on at Harvard is a microcosm of what's going on at many other American universities, and that much of it isn't new.  As far back as I can remember (and I come from a family of academics), students and faculty alike have hated their university presidents, viewing them as uninterested in academics or out of touch with their student bodies.  As at Harvard, with the decibel level of campus politics higher today than at any time since the 1960s, there is a lot of talking (or complaining, depending on one's perspective) going on and less respect for opposing viewpoints.  Harvard is hardly unique in this respect.    Bradely castigates Summers for his handling of several episodes with faculty (most noteably the Cornel West debacle) but misses the broader trend that acadmics as a whole have been getting into narrower and narrower specalties that prevent their work from being of much use to anyone.  This doesn't mean that Summers was justified in how he treated West, who was (and is) a true educator, but it does deny this book some much-needed context.    Similarly, Bradley's comments on Summers' stress on achievement by students misses that the same line was toed by the genteel Neil Rudenstine, who once told the Crimson that 'students don't come to Harvard to have fun' when asked why the university maintains an academic schedule that places fall term finals immediately after winter break.  This was a particularly poor-timed comment after a rash of student suicides on campus and reports that Harvard's student suicide rate was twice the national average.  Overall, only the most die-hard Summers haters will find anything valuable in Harvard Rules.  Everyone else interested in the state of campus would be better of reading the Crimson from time to time 
 This didn't feel like an authentic Seuss, just as another reviewer has pointed out... The narrative is stiff, the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor, and the story is just plain dull. Although I have no problem at all with presenting anti-war and anti-arms-proliferation sentiment in a format suitable for a child, I don't think that this book does it well. The overall impression I get is that of a message being sent in the style of Seuss, with rehashed elements, rather than a genuinely entertaining Seuss book 
 The paperback edition of the book has a most attractive cover, but an entirely misleading one. Across a lovely curl of orange peel, looking like it might have come out of a Dutch still life of the 17th century, the title of the book is printed in Poetica, a script deriving from an even earlier period. The same script is used for chapter headings and page numbers, and there are similar decorative features in the book itself. It would be an ideal presentation for one of the art-historical novels of Tracy Chevalier, for example, but it bears no relationship whatsoever to a tale of sexual awakening, betrayal, revenge, and death set in Nazi-occupied France and in the late twentieth century.  Why do I go on about such an apparently trivial matter? Because the element of spurious charm, somewhere between a travelogue and a gourmet magazine, though clearly an ingredient that readers of Joanne Harris' other books such as CHOCOLAT have found attractive, is at odds with what could have been a very powerful story. Even as it is, once the action moves out of the kitchen and the portraits of the canny provincial French villagers have been gotten out of the way, the tale of a nine-year-old girl growing up in wartime France and of her return years later as a widow in her sixties does manage to hold the interest. But the construction is just that much too obvious and that darned charm too liberally applied for the book really to do justice to its subject. Ultimately, the terrible trauma of the time is presented as little more than a plot device, and one is invited to see these people as quaintly folkloric rather than painfully real 
 The remote is very thick. You need a side picture to see how thick this thing is. The buttons are not comfortable either 
 This exceedingly short memoir of a Swedish SS volunteer in the last days of the SS Nordland division in 1945 is short on real specifics yet long on multiple condemnations of the Bolshevik hordes. Wallin through Hillblad (the editor), gives little in detail on his unit or men he fought with. This contrasts with his unrepentant and relentless anti-Soviet propaganda which even reaches out to American flyers. Wallin conveniently forgets a couple of facts: (1) Nazi Germany was the aggressor nation in WWII., and (2) Wallin volunteered to fight for this criminal regime.   Apart from this, the quality of the Wallin's writing or recollection and Hillblads editing is very simplistic. Fictional works like the Forgotten Soldier capture the drama and action of the Eastern Front conflict much better and without the speeches. One star only and that is for the few pages of photos at the end of the book. "Twilight of the Gods" yeah, sure Erik 
 Very simplistically written. Interesting topic and examples but the first part is way too elementary and self serving of the author.  Some new information but not riveting 
 Jane Yolen fans hungry for female heroes will be sorely disappointed by this collection.  The "heroic" deeds in many of these stories are pointless.  The epic tone and flat characters make for dull reading.  The stories are drawn from diverse cultures, but so many details are left  unexplained that we are left with a pageantry of exotica.  None of the  heroes feel like real people with whom girls can identify.  The 1 star is  awarded to Yolen's introductory comments about girl heroes and her  granddaughters' letter of response 
 Richard is a funny guy. He never can overcome his SCIENTISM and naturalistic reductionism. I wish I could talk to him to help him out (if I were doctor). He needs (1) therapy and (2) to THINK a little more... Dawkins like to use straw-man arguments and does NOT know anything about Christian Theology. I'm truly Sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about (when talks about religious matters, or even science).  I have also read his article "Science is not a religion" (which is not very good article), and apparently FOR HIM science is a religion...  Usually religious experience involve (a) awareness of the Transcendent and (b) total commitment to It. Dawkins' Transcendant is "THE GREAT SCIENTISM". :D and of course he is commited to it. Not the science, but scientism... Otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism?  
 I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target 
 I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.    
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.    This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.  And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.  
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 I've been surprised again and again by how many common rhyming words are carelessly omitted from the lists in this book.  It's cheap but still not worth the money 
 This book tries to convince non-Christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy, without addressing fundamental objections 
 I had this book recomended to me (repeatedly) over the course of my reading of Radical Evolution.  I was underimpressed by Ray's endless wanking at the idea of replacing human interaction with computer interaction, and the substition of the mortal coil with the superiortity of the T-800.  If you are non-proficient with the subtlety of human mechinations, then the promise of escape via virtual reality, nano-orgasm machines, and techno-immortality can seem like the stuff of dreams.  As a list of "bold predictions" this sketchbook of sci-fi cliches lacks the hard science to suggest the wildly optomistic timelines the author suggests.    As an artifact from the heady, euphoric days before the dot com burst, one can see how this book was published, and subsequently purchased by a great many people.  By the time the author was defending previousely made statements about the actualization of his earlier predictions, I saw a pattern of half-truths that paints a techno-eutopia which here, in 2006, hardly exists in the labs of MIT, let alone for purchase as Best Buy, as the author so desperately hopes for.    This book summarizes a decade's worth of Popular Science articles (that decade being the 1990's) and the most enticing fantasies of the transhumanists, but is not actually fun to read.  The dialogues with "Molly,"  the author's internal dialouge about the future of the toys he wishes will save him, borders on embarrassing.  There are a dozen books about exactly these subjects, which should be read first 
 As an Artist (Painter) who buys many art books and counts Jenny Saville as one of his favorite younger painters, I have been eagerly awaiting this books release.  I was also fortunate enough to get the Catalogue for Saville's Territories exhibition, and not I don't want to sell it.  Considering the quality of the Territories and Migrants publications, my expectations for this book were admittedly high.  I also saw both shows in person.  As for this book, Disappointing is an understatement.  Let's start with the obvious, it is incomplete and does not contain any of her earlier work and the text is nothing new, just a collection of older stuff.  Then the reproduction quality is poor, the images are too small, the colors aren't accurate, they're overly contrasting.  This leads me to believe that someone that never saw the actual works ran the images through some Photoshop printing filter and didn't actually compare the printed images to the paintings.  In addition, the layout of the artwork in the book is just plain bad.  Instead of centering the images on the page, they hug the center, which makes them awkward to look at.  For a book publisher, this is unforgivable.  The positive aspects of the book are:  well, there's finally a book on Saville and the photos of her studies, references and studio a well done, in fact there could be more.  They do provide detail shots of her painting, which is mandatory with her work considering the scale.  However, the few positives can't make up for a very poor book overall on an important contemporary artist.  One reviewer said, "Move over Lucian Freud", I think not.  A comparison cannot be made until Saville is in her 80's, then we'll (well someone will) talk.  While her earlier work is very impressive, I'm becoming concerned about where she is going paint wise.  The earlier work has "character", the newer work and pieces from the Migrants exhibition seem slick, rushed and overly pretty.  The new work also lacks the conceptual strength of the early work (her weak point anyway).  It seems to me she's becoming a clich of herself.  The best comparison I can think of is the animation style of the early Simpsons or South Park compared to later years.  The rough edges and distinctiveness have disappeared, replaces by standardization and predictability, never a good thing for an artist.  I hope that this phase of Saville's career will pass quickly.  Final Score  4 out of 1 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd; SHUT UP & play your GUITAR !  Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here.    He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd 
 This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts 
 The book was disappointing. I returned it. I was looking for something with much more detail. The book seemed to be written at a middle school or early high school level 
 Very poor standard of logo design on the whole. Most of the work featured is quirky and completely uncommercial. If you regularly produce this kind of work then this may be of interest to you as a reference but, for the rest of us, it's nothing more than an insight into the minds of the more idiosyncratic designers out there 
 I've followed this series from the beginning and this book is the one I least like. Nothing happens, with even the ending being disappointing - it's basically just a quick summary rather than the usual exciting finale. In 800 pages, the book is all didactic political talk and explanation. And those "bad guys" who get their due justice receive it all offscreen. It was such a disappointment, I wouldn't recommend the cliffsnotes for this book- they'd be boring too. And that's too bad, as the series held up well for 8 books 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 The language used in this book has a lot to be desired, especially for a book being read by children.  My thirteen year-old son started reading it for school.  He realized it was not something he should be reading and alerted me.  I then read the book and totally agree!  Also, the outcome of the story teaches kids that it is okay to cheat if you get away with it: For three years of high school, Simon and his friends cheat by accesssing exams on the school's computer.  The authorities suspect Simon until it is found that a teacher is allowing football players access to the school's computers using his password.  The football players view pornography on the internet and the teacher gets in trouble for permitting it.  Since these students had access to school information through the computers there is no way of finding out who was actually accessing and printing the tests.  Simon and his friends get off the hook and are never caught 
 I own the graphite style of this set.  I was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great, didn't chip easily, and was a great size.  After a year of use I've come up with a list of problems:  The clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed.  The semi-matte finish acquires a "powdery", almost bleached, look to it after many washings (says dishwasher safe, guess that means the colors don't wash away immediately)  My biggest complaint:  We bought these because they were "microwave safe".  I don't know what microwave safe means to most people, but it means to me that I could put a plate, bowl or cup in the microwave, heat up the contents, and then safely remove the object and use it.  In the case of the set I purchased, it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode.  Unfortunately in the case of the Sango Graphite set, it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the (plate/bowl/cup) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the (plate/bowl/cup) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave.  They get VERY hot!  (Cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120F while cup surface is 170F!) I've only broken 2 items from the set, both times I dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned (first time I thought it was a fluke, second time I learned my lesson) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave.    I emailed Sango several times and received no response at all.    While I liked the set a lot initially, I have been very disappointed over time with its quality. I will never purchase another from Sango again 
 To be sure this arm would fit, I visited the manufacturers website and chose my exact LCD model number in their menu system. My TV model number supposedly matched this arm, and the correct mount adapter was supposed to be included as well.   The manufacturers website stated that this mount CAME WITH THE ADAPTER PLATE for a 200mm x 200mm VESA compliant TV. It did NOT. It came only with a 200mm x 100mm.   On top of that, luckily before we tried to get the manufacturer to send us the plate for free considering their false claims, we noticed that the screws meant for the plate also do not work. They are too small and can be inserted into the back of the TV with your hand.  I am very frustrated. One would think that going to the manufacturers website would safeguard against this sort of thing. I will never buy from this company again 
 Mark Anson manages to write one of the most horrible books about derivatives. Mr.Anson's ideas are dated and wouldn't be much help to anyone.  I feel sorry for the CalPERS fund if this is the brainpower they have running it 
 This 2006 second edition follows the first edition of two years earlier.  Some of the detailed listings (including such things as hotel tariffs and phone numbers) have changed, a very few towns or attractions have been added or deleted, and a four-page introductory chapter, What's New in China has been added listing some of the few changes.    The revision can scarcely be described as thorough.  The remark that Chinese currency is "not easily obtainable overseas" has not been true generally since well before the date of this new edition;  the report concerning the Lhasa railway, that "foundations have already (sic!) been laid for over half the track", speaks of a thousand-kilometre railway which opened for service on 2nd July in the year of publication, years after foundations for "over half the track" had been completed.  The fewness of changes to tariffs, charges and phone numbers suggests that checking has been far from complete.  Each chapter is attributed to an individual author.  The puzzle is that, although with only one exception every chapter in the new edition is attributed to a different author from the chapter in the first edition, most of the text is identical.  Nowhere does this edition seem to acknowledge the contribution of the original authors.  Perhaps an essential ingredient of plagiarism is a degree of furtiveness that is lacking her, and perhaps the original authors agreed to their text being attributed to others;  but the reader is entitled, observing the differences of asserted authorship, to expect revision and rewriting altogether more substantial than what has occurred.    Any guidebook to such a vast country as China faces the danger that thinness of coverage will limit its usefulness, and that calls for the greatest discipline in deciding what should be included and what may be left out.  In large measure, this book fails that test.  In particular, it fails comparison with what has become, whether begrudgingly or otherwise,  the industry standard - Lonely Planet.  Roughly comparable with Lonely Planet China in terms of weight, Frommer's China contains substantially less text.  The book has no qualities to outweigh that disadvantage.       
 As soon as I read this book, I wished I was the type of customer who sent back books of little value.  We have just began the process of adoption and we are exploring the different avenues available in domestic adoption so I thought this book would be helpful, but instead I found the same information I was able to obtain in less than one day at the computer, by entering "Adoption" in my search engine. The chapter containing the laws of every state was concise and puts it all in one easy package but I am not sure if that is enough to make this worthwhile. The book also lacked any real material on the homestudy process, what you might excpect from agencies versus attorneys versus state agencies, and the pros and cons of each.  So if you are completely new to the process of adoption, want the facts and nothing but the facts, are pretty sure that you want to use an attorney and conduct your own search for a prospective birth mother, then this book is for you.  If not you might want to look elsewher 
 I love Victor Hugo's writting ability. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. I believe his book Les Miserables is the best fictional book that has ever been written, bar none. I also love the Hunchback of Notre Dame, to me it's one of the top five to ten books that I have ever read.   Anyone who has read any of his books knows that the climaxes of his books are extraordinary.... no one comes close. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. They also know that his writting is more beautiful than just about any other author who has ever lived.   People who have read Victor Hugo's books also know that he likes to go off on tangents that get away from the story for numerous pages. For instance, in Les Miserables he goes on for countless pages describing the convent and the sewer system. These tangents that he loves to go on are extremly unnecesary and take away from the story in his books but you deal with them because the story is worth it.  The Toilers of the Sea is also a great story but the book is so marred with these tangets and over explanation of EVERYTHING that it just totally bogs the book down. It's a good story but not good enough to fight through everything.   The first half of the book is very difficult to get through, the first fifty or so pages is just an explanation of the surrounding islands... the next 150 pages or so are overkill explanations of the plot and seeting it up. I honestly don't believe half of the people who start this book will make it to page 200 unless they are forced to for a school project etc.   The next 230 pages are a lot more interesting but Victor Hugo's over explaining every detail and his constantly annoying habbit of saying the same thing ten different ways really makes this book difficult and rather boring.  Gillete, the main character is really a awesome character (he reminds me of Jean ValJean in Les Miserables)and there really is a good story here about him, Deruchette, Senior Clubin and Miss Leherity (I'm probably buthering the spellings.... sorry) but I honestly think very few people will make it through the book. If Victor would have had an editor who could have helped clean this up and shorten it I think it would have been a lot better.  P.S. I also hated the ending.... what Gillete did to himself at the end of the book just totally annoyed me 
 These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant. The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as "surround sound" (yeah right...) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers. 
 If you are taking an introduction to genetics course, this book is difficult to understand. It seemingly presents the concepts for those that have had previous knowledge of genetics. The chapters on Mendelian Genetics, Mitosis, and Meiosis are done well, but later chapters dealing with regulation, mutation, transcription, and translation are difficult to understand. The pictures are not very helpful, either. If this book is required for your introductory genetics course, i recommend getting another book in addition to this one 
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 The book is about 50% actual negotiating tactics and 50% political commentary.  There were some interesting ideas insofar as negotiating strategies, but nothing really unique.  The author comes across as a combination of an friendly, lovable uncle and the Jack Lemmon character in Glengarry Glen Ross.  His political commentaries showed a breathtaking shallowness and lack of historical knowledge...such as his statement that the Western world's confrontation with the Islamic world began in 1979(?!).  In the appendices, Cohen includes several memorandums to top officials in various administrations which provide insight to a neo-con understanding of the world. That such an underdeveloped grasp of geopolitics occupies a large portion of the book throughout is disappointing, and seems to influence Mr. Cohen's thoughts on negotiating.  
 This is a great book, but it is just stretched  way too long. It starts out great and keeps the reader glued to the pages. Then the book starts to end the same things happen over and over again and you just think when id this book going to end. Personaly i think this book could have ended about 50 pages befor it did. I think the book would have had a shot at the Newbery if it didn't go on as long as it di. That just goes to show that you cant hve a super-de-duper start but then your ending just really stinks your book wont be that good. You need to have a good ending and a good begining in order to have a good book 
 This is certainly as dry as a computer manual, so Microsoft could have included this as at least a PDF with PowerPoint. So did not do that and now they want you to buy this separately. That itself is reason to not buy this book and look at other alternatives.  My favorite others are:  How To Do Everything with PowerPoint 2003 Cutting Edge PowerPoint for Dummies PowerPoint 2003 Visual Quickstart Guid 
 I purchased this book because of the time it takes to assemble a shopping list for both "The Perricone Promise" and "The Perricone Weight Loss Diet". I thought this would do it for it. It lists a "basic guideline for foods", but it is not comprehensive of all the items needed to make the recipes on the two week diet. I'm still painstakingly going through the recipes to assemble my shopping list 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 It's unfortunate, but Todd's tenth Claudia Seferius mystery is probably the worst. Todd has has our lovable heroine hotfooting it off to the tiny Roman governed client kingdom of Histria. Failure to read the contractual small print means she thinks she's off to negotiate a lucrative wine contract but after considerable stringing along she discovers that it's in fact to marry the King. After ariving on the peninsula she finds herself chaperoned by the effortlessly personable Mazares, the oak tree that is Pavan and the King's close family  comprising the King's brother, Kazan, his wife Rosmerta, their sons, Marek and Mir and finally Vanu, married to one of the sons but sleeping with Kazan. As usual bodies start turning up although these are historical. - Mazares first wife, Brac - first in line to throne, the old king Dol, Mazares, son and daughter, a boat builder,  the physician until we get quite a list. After dressing up as a goddess for the Zeltane festival Caludia spends most her time figuring out how to escape her impending matimony and the rest half heartedly chasing down ridiculous murder theories and spending time at the local stray waifs farm headed up by Salome, Tobias, Lora and the rest of the white robed Amazons. All the while we get Todd's small chapter inserts into the mind of the murderer - this time called Nosferatu. It's all a bit tedious until Orbilio turns up to turn over Claudia's stomach again and save the day, Claudia, and anyone else who happens to be around. As I said, this is the weakest of the Serferius novels simply because it's not exciting in any way and Claudia's heart's just not in it. Maybe we've a classic case of Davis here - our heroine needs to be in Rome to be at her best. Hopefully the next one will have Claudia back to her spitting, fiery self.. 
 Well, if you've just discovered the British Sci-Fi/Family series, than this is the gift for you all. All DVDs included have superior sound and picture and an excellent set of extras. But to purchase the entire range of R1 Doctor Who DVDs for $600 is a bit pricey.. 
 and quite a few stupid things, too, including hitchhiking as a viable transportation method.  Many other books will give you much more info than this one.  The real goal of this book is in the last chapter (yes, I read it all) - buy less.  Buy less because it is better on the Earth, on your budget & on your health.  I suggest you save on all of the above and don't buy this book 
 A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!  I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as  history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?   PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.   HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME SEE THE COMMUNIST TRAITOR JOHN KERRY WHO FINKED ONHIS COUNTRY AND HIS COMRADES. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

 In short, this cd is half good and half crap.  The cd starts strong with catchy guitar, and the obvious sharp synth parts.  The thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years. Frontman Brandon Flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success (The Bravery, The Fever, Bloc Party, Moving Units) and that they are "riding on our success".  Meanwhile the Killers go on tour with Depeche Mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason Flowers doesn't take a hint.  He has simply become the Depeche Mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up (cuz they should). Unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than Depeche Mode, seeing as how Flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert. Plus half their cd sucks and their new cd isn't sounding much better. The new single is awful. Quite terrible.  Now I know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down, but I know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music, music history, or probably even how to play an instrument, so it won't bother me.   If you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands: The Bravery Kaiser Chiefs Moving Units Bloc Party The Fever The Unicorns Wolf Parade The Dove 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 Perfect if you're the ages of 14-16 or very easily impressed other than that "pretty wack". The withered EP recordings were more raw and powerful. something about this album is just too watered down. The Lyrics on Lipgloss and letdown are so stupid I cant help but think they're about tripping someone

 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$.. 
 I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre.  In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner... 
 You have to be truly annoying to write a book so bad that I keep reading despite myself, until I finish it. You have to be transcendently annoying for the book to be so bad that I feel compelled to spend four minutes of my life giving it a bad review. Chuck Klosterman, take a bow. You are truly annoying.  The quickest, surest, easiest way to be so annoying is to be shrill and self-justifying while expressing a series of opinions that are not merely idiotic, but willfully ignorant. Congratulations, Chuck Klosterman. You took the easy route to getting on my nerves, and the nerves of anybody who knows anything about real heavy metal music.   I shall summarize: he thinks Poison and Guns and Roses and the like are better than Priest or Danzig. Poison. Better than Priest. GNR. Better than Danzig. Or Metallica.   I kid you not.   Uh, let's see if I can come up with a metaphor, for those not familiar with the bands in question. Here goes: This is like saying, uh, that Stephen King is better than Shakespeare. Or that Andy Warhol is better than Michelangelo.  Get it? It's just stupid, and almost intentionally so. You can't argue with somebody like this. They're not worth it.  What is most annoying, of course, is that a lot of people agree with him and also make their annoying noises and write their annoying words until one just can't help but swat at these mosquitoes...  Okay, time's up. If I prevented one intelligent heavy metal fan from wasting time on this tar-baby of a book, it was worth it 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 It is really difficult to believe that Giles, er, ah, the Rev. Giles is a pastor. He touts himself as a "theologian" and big game hunter (tough guy), but the proof, as Ma used to say, is in the pudding (Okay, Ma wasn't entirely original). The pudding for a preacher is his sermon, a radio talk show host his radio talk show (Oh, hum...), and the written word his book. Of late the Rev. Giles churns them little cupcakes out, and while they may have some mass appeal to that fringe of the church-going Right who barely skim the headlines let alone a few verses in their Bibles, he does not persuade an audience barely over the line from the sanctified few to the secularized many. But perhaps that's the audience he does not want to reach, i.e., the unregenerate and reprobate, those predestined to damnation. Theologian Giles weighs in with his commentary on the book of Daniel and in typical Evangelical fashion, skews it to young people using his youthful slang lingo to capture the hearts [and minds] of his readers. But theologian Giles does a poor job of setting the historical and literary context, something that a seminary graduate such as himself should easily be able to do. Instead we are given hip-slogans, a white-man's-jive, and strained applications. If Giles' approach in his book(s) mirrors that of his Sunday morning sermons, no doubt he is using a silly outline in a PowerPoint presentation where his devotees follow along and fill in the blanks. By way of a Scriptural illustration, while new believers will crave the "milk" of the word, they must necessarily in time crave the "meat" of the word. As the writer who penned those words suggests, to crave the milk only and not the meat, is evidence of immaturity and non-growth. The idea is that believers must be challenged to grow and not stay in their immaturity. A first reading of this book convinced me that the Rev. Giles is not attempting to move his readers from immaturity to maturity, but rather, as German theologians (real ones) would say, is merely addressing their zits um leben (present life situation). While addressing one's current life situation may be important, as Platonic as it may sound (for those of you in seminary, Plato was a philosopher), it is important for any teacher to strongly move his pupils (readers here) from their current state to the place in which they should be. That's called "stretching" in acting: as a good director will force an actor to stretch in self-discovery, a good teacher (preacher) and writer should seek to stretch his readers. Rev. Giles, in my view, has let his readers down (the frozen chosen), and has once again opened up the Christian movement to scorn and derision from the very audience that we, as Christians, are called to reach. And so it goes 
 I am a big Dawn fan, so I miss Dawn.They could've replaced Dawn with someone better than Abby. Abby is an obnoxious eigth grader who thinks she is so funny. Abby shows of that she is so cool. In the book she tries to help her mom and sister ajust to Stoneybrook. Abby should have never joined the club. Kristy is right when she says that Abby is a bad baby-sitter. Abby should have never joined the club 
 I was very disappointed in CD.  Way to hillbilly for me 
 A great idea, and a fun coffee table (bathroom) book. I am, however, disturbed by the omission of Phish's rhythm section. Michael Gordon and Jon Fishman are undoubtedly more talented than half the people in this book.  It would also have been nice to explain the true heritage of the many musicians listed in the book.. 
 The only reason why I think this "movie" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.  Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.  Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.  It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.  Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet 
 Not at all memorable.  Formulaic in that Oprah's Book Club sort of way...martyr-like female who is a "better" person at the end of the book having learned a valuable lesson about life, love, the world or all three.  Yawn, yawn, yawn...there are too many good books in the world to waste your time reading this 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 Here's one bit of evidence of dumbing down in America: I paid money for this crabby, unscientific, pompous book. Don't make the same mistake 
 So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic 
 There is not much to say about this book except that it is often extremely confusing for the layman. The examples skip steps, there is usually no explanation as to how to apply the theorems and one is often completely clueless as to how to do the exercises, or much guesswork must be done on how to apply the given formulas.  If you are already knowledgeable on the subject of numerical analysis this book might be a good reference for refreshing your memory but for the beginner it is for the most part going to be a frustrating waste of time 
 Look.  We rented this "film" because we thought the premise had merit.  Finally, something outside the Bud-beer-comercial sameness everything in our culture pushes.  Bravo to the film on that.  Bravo!  It DID tackle the subject with seriousness. At no time did it stray from that intention.  OK.  Good for you.  GAWD was this BORING!  GAWD was this amaturish!  Dear Lord in Heaven, please help kids who want to spend a few weekends slapping together a "film" (entirely shot on videotape) with the dialogue, with the plot (so it's not so predictable), with the CAMERAWORK that doesn't look like Uncle Dave got ahold of his camcorder.  What's with all the smoke in the rooms?  Too much!  A good student film.  National Lampoon will put their name in front of anything now.   Ladies and Gentlemen... like the main character dude in the film, when renting or buying "films", check anything before you take it out for the night... make sure you're clear if it's going to give you a urinary tract infection... or if it's still figuring out how to do this whole filmmaking thing for the first time.  I want a new rating.  "A" for amature.  
 This signal booster did not work for me. I set it up according to the instructions, connected to a Dlink Router DI-624.  When I attempted to connect to the router via laptop, it would connect and then drop the connection after about 10 seconds. That would repeat indefinitely.  I tracked the signal with a strength meter, and it boosted it to the level expected, but for some reason when the connection was made to the router, it was dropped.   I sent the first unit into Hawking thinking it was defective, but they replaced the unit, and it did exactly the same thing.   I have no idea why it didn't work. Maybe my fault.  I am thinking perhaps I need two of these, one at the router, and one at the laptop. Perhaps the signal going back to the router is not strong enough to keep the connection. 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 If one reads this, they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash, because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work.  It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself!  One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.  Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it.  If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere.  Save your money - and the headache!  To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness.   I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker.  There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised.  While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives 
 I am now at page 590 in a 720 page book.  Absolutely nothing of relevance has happened.  Similar to the 2nd book, I'm guessing the last 50 pages will be a crazy and implausible 'wrap up'.  Instead of focusing on how verity regains his throne, how they thwart the red ships or how they dispose of regal, the only thing that happens is we get to read about how fitz travels literally from buck to past the mountains.  Nothing really happens along the way either.  Fitz travels on a road little more than a trail, he gets tired, goes to sleep, starts skilling toward molly and burrich although he doesn't want to and then wakes up again to drink some elfbark tea.  Rinse and repeat for 600 pages, literally.  I see no adequate way for Hobb to 'finish' up this book in the next 130 pages considering her rambling writing style.  I find myself thinking "oh no he's going to sleep again" and shaking my head almost every other chapter. Fitz gets captured like three times and three times he 'manages' to escape.  I felt like i was watching an episode of the original Batman on television!  It's amazing how one can write 600 pages and have nothing happen at all.  I understand character development but this is beyond reasonable when it's 99% that and 1% story/plot.  I also found myself thinking aloud "i don't want to read this anymore" many times throughout the meanderings in this book.  I'm not exaggerating, nothing happens in the 600 pages I've read.    Not to mention the number of plot holes I've encountered.  It's baffling. I really regret reading this series.  For example, Molly encounters old men who recognize her as the bastard's woman, yet Regal can still not find her!  Okay!     It started off decent with the first book.  It was a good intro and I was excited to start the 2nd book.  After 500 pages in that book with nothing happening, i started to get an idea of about the 3rd.  But by then it was too late to stop reading the series.  Hobb's writing style is at times rather annoying too.  Whenever the characters ask a question with a negative particle, she insists on switching the subject with the negative ala "Can not you.." or "Should not you.."  Then she switches back to regular American dialogue.  She isnt' consistent with it either.  It's awkward at best.  Each and every single female character has to be sassy and always try to take charge.  God forbid she portrays a female that's not 'equal' to men or appears weak!  Her villains are laughable.    We know nothing of more of the red ships or Regal, or the forged ones by 500 pages into the third book than we did 50 pages into book one.  It's astounding how she can concentrate so much on Fitz, who never really grows anyway, and leave all the other characters to a single dimensional fate.  Regal is the embodiment of evil and that's good enough for you!  I really want to stop reading this book even now at 600 pages into it because I know the ending is going to be terrible, yet I am compelled to finish it because I've invested so much time into it...  Read this book at your own risk 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
  I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the "CHINOOK State", Mt.St. Helens did not have "LAVA" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a "PAIR of winds" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal.                                                         
 I think the machine was great at first. It's fast and eficient, but if you have more than 5 lb.of meat to grind and you don't want smoke coming out from the motor,  You might want to give it a break in between. Plus, the cutting plates and the feed screw turn rusting and black even you put cooking oil  after wash as directed by the instruction book, and they have this iron/metal smell on the cutting plate that contaminate the meat. I am very disappointed. 
 Behar's book addresses borders as both metaphors and reality in a facinating way, yet other than that, this book fails miserably due to her experiments with the construction of her text. Overall, the historical development of ethnographic representation would have been better served if Behar had decided to write her book in a different style that better represents the ethnographic aspect of her text 
 The book is well written, and is primarely about watches produced in the USA, and pocket watches at that.  There are a lot of illustrations, and describtions of most of the principles of the art of watchmaking 
 pretending that 3-6 never happened (don't we all wish that!) this flea bag starts with ms.curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school(with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her) and still living in fear of her brother michael. well as you can guess he's back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels.    nothing new here and nothing worth seeing (but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet (playing her "pyscho" role once again) act together for what would be the last time).  just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms. curtis's daughter in collage, as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
 If you're just curious about what six-sigma is this is a good, easy to understand, book.  But it teaches you little that can be applied.    I'm in a company that is begining a six sigma effort and I am assisting the black and green belts in their work.  I had wanted a book that would help me do the things I would probably be asked to assist with such as building a SIPOC diagram.  Instead, the book is devoted almost entirely to telling you what the black belts do on a project (half of the 300 pages are about statistics and much of the remainder is about things like project charter).  The obvious problem is that a book like this can't actually teach you to be a black-belt. So after 300 pages I know some statistical principles, but not enough to actually do anything with, and I know nearly nothing about how to assist a black belt on a project.  Before you say "but six sigma is all about statistics" let me say that I know that.  Stats are the core, and doing them takes training.  You will not learn to do six-sigma stats from this book.  You will probably not learn much else from this book either 
 This a strange book for me indeed. I loved the photos, especially those of The Doors performing, but the writing is bad and depressing. Dylan Jones fails to do anything to capture the essence of Jim Morrison's art and instead writes a book that basically paints a depressing picture. It appears he takes a lot of gossip as truth (though Morrison was known for his "wild child" activities) and I don't understand why so much effort was put into such a gorgeous-looking book when the writing burns the main character. Jones obviously does not understand or feel anything about The Doors considering he called "Waiting For The Sun" a disappointing work and trashes a great song like "Not To Touch The Earth." I'm also surprised he has so many pictures of Morrison at concerts when he totally trashes his moves and wild performances on stage. This is a weird book in that it has so many great pictures, it is a photographic record, but the writing does not strive to dissect The Doors art, it only focuses on the negative aspects of the life of Jim Morrison. I very much more enjoyed the biography "Break On Through" which was smoothly written and treated the bad stuff with style and really dissected Morrison's work. Great photos, disappointing book 
 I agree with one of the spotlight reviewers that violence is a genre and an art form in many Japanese films; but that is not an exclusively Japanese cinematic domain. I have watched this film three times now, and probably will never watch it again. The film has been described at length by many viewers, and both of the spotlight reviewers give very good descriptions of the film. [In fact they are both very good reviewers: especially Zack Davisson, of Osaka, Japan, whose opinions I value highly]. However, for me, a film has to capture my interest and hold it. Unfortunately, this film did not endear me to it, or hold my interest. I really did not think it was that good a film. And I DO understand Japanese cinema: I grew up with Japanese films; and they are amongst my favorite, if not entirely favorite films period!  There are so many truly fantastic Japanese films out there, that to give this film 4 or 5 stars would do those other great cinematic masterpieces an injustice. I do not rate horror, action, sci-fi, drama or any other genres the same when reviewing. For example, I would not compare a 5 star film such as "Ikiru" or "Harakiri" the same as I would a 5 star film in the horror genre such as "Sleepy Hollow," [which is a 5 star film to me]. "Ikiru" and "Harakiri are in a league of their own. Yet, I also like "Sleepy Holow." Each genre is good in its own domain. As for "Ichi the Killer," many people that I know only know Japanese films through Takashi Miike. Mainly due to his film "Audition." Therefore, I would recommend that viewers seek out others whose films are very good, and that you may be interested in.   One in particular would be Takeshi Kitano, in terms of contemporary Japanese directors, or Kiyoshi Kurosawa to name just two great modern directors. Their films are accessible, and truly fabulous. Also, you might want to check out another Takashi Miike film, "The Happiness of the Katakuris," which is a delightfully wicked film. Miike really took a dare in that film. And for those of you who are not really sure which Japanese films may or may not be good, you might want to check out MidnightEye.com, which gives several Japanese film highlights. This might help. My main reason for writing a review of this film is because many people today have only seen a small number of films from Japan, and think that this [violent themed films] is all the Japanese mass-market to America. And this is unfortunate, because there are many great delightful gems in Japanese cinema. However, this is not one of them.   Moreover, this film seemed to me to be an attempt at being shocking, and far from it, it was more an excercise in banality. Although not to the degree I have seen in many American films, the film still left me with something less than desired. That is not to say that other reviewers do not have a valid opinion, or maybe saw something in the film itself that they themselves like. If these are the type of films you like, then you will find that there are many others like this on the market today. However, if you are seeking truly great Japanese films, I would advise you to look around, you might just find yourself amazed at what awaits you in those video stores. 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 I'm no expert on film, much less French New Wave. I just like to explore a bit. So I picked this up because I heard it was considered to be influential, and because the idea of Richard Crenna being in something like this struck me as amusing. I liked the ocean/siren bit at the beginning quite a lot, but the ultra-slow pace lost me soon after that. It's also a bit difficult to watch the train/helicopter bit at the end with an unjaded eye. It just didn't captivate me 
 I find that I just have a hard time enjoying Sherlock Holmes pastiches.  There are a few collections out there in which I have enjoyed some of the stories and not others.  This collection is mediocre at best and frankly just does not quite fit with or come anywhere close to living up to the original.    This collection of stories ostensibly covers the years between Sherlock Holmes' presumed death at Reichenbach Falls in his death struggle with his arch enemy Professor Moriarity to his reappearance a few years later.  The stories are connected by an underlying theme - that Holmes is working for his brother Mycroft under the pseudonym Mr. Sigerson, not as a spy exactly, but collecting intelligence that may be useful to the British government.  The tales take us far and wide across the world from Tibet, Alaska, San Francisco, Thailand, etc.  And of course Holmes runs into a number of unlikely crimes that he solves along the way.  But the bottom line is, these stories are mediocre at best and I would not recommend this book. 
 This movie is superficial and populated with glamorous and unprincipled characters.  Kate Hudson, while photogenic in the extreme, is not believable with her fake and shaky Irish accent.  The plot is unbelievable, and the characters are offensive.  The structure of the film is clumsy, and the idea that any sort of trusting relationship and marriage is possible with these people who can not keep it in their shorts (including Hudson) is naive and unworldly, rather than the reverse.   The false sense of lighthearted sophistication is tedious.  Don't bother.   
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 I'm sorry, but I can't read this book without breaking out into incredulous laughter on just about every page. The author is so over-the-top in his adoring descriptions of Google and its founders that I sometimes have difficulty not believing that it's some kind of parody. For example, the first lines of Chapter One: "Sergey Brin and Larry Page cruised onto the stage to the kind of roars and excitement that teenagers normally reserve for rock stars.". Ok, so I think, maybe that's just an accurate description of the event. But how about these quotes from the introduction: "Googleware and the lucrative Google ad system are a reflection of their genius and foresight"... (um, I'm pretty sure Overture was doing the paid ads thing before google)... or how about this, from the very first lines of the intro: "Not since Gutenberg invented the modern printing press more than 500 years ago, making books and scientific tomes affordable and widely available to the masses, has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.". Um, ok. So I guess Tim Berners Lee inventing the Web itself was a relatively minor occurance in the Googleverse. And there's more - from page 11: "In the rich and storied history of American invention and capitalism, there had never been a meteoric rise comparable to theirs. It had taken Thomas Edison a quarter of a century to invent the lightbulb; Alexander Graham Bell had spent many years developing the telephone; Henry Ford created the modern assembly line and turned it into the mass production and consumption of automobiles only after decades of work...". Ok, so now they are inventors who outshine Thomas Edison. Wow. I'm thinking, get a grip. It's a search engine. It worked pretty well (but is now being overtaken by spammers and other people gaming the system). They built a huge parallel computer system, which is great. They grew at a fast rate, which is fantastic. But let's face it, making a search engine that worked better than the competition isn't anywhere on the same scale of achievement as inventing the lightbulb, telephone, or mondern mass production methods. They are smart guys, but they aren't God's gift to the world. I'm sorry, but the tone of this book just completely throws me off. I bought it because I'm honestly interested in how Google came to be. But I feel like I'm being bombarded on every page by so much adulation for Google and its founders, that it starts to feel more like a religious tract than the history of a company 
 Egads! This is an awful movie.  Even by 80s standards it's possibly one of the worst, slow moving, jaw yapping so called horror films I have ever seen and I've seen some doozies.  The movie is nothing but one long scene of inane boring dialogue after another with perhaps a split second of monster "scares" thrown in between.  An entire hour and fifteen minutes goes by before any kind of excitement happens and it's pretty mediocre when it does.  There isn't a single scare throughout, not a moment of suspense and subplots that go nowhere.  Who cares that the photographer's girlfriend is pregnant, it had nothing to do with the story at all.    And the extended shower scene that shows up if you click on the C.H.U.D.'s glowing eyes during the menu is identical to the scene in the movie, the only difference is you get to see the T&A that was cut out of the theatrical release.  Stay away, stay far far away from this awful movie or watch it on high speed fast forward like I did.    C.H.U.D is a D.U.D.  
 It was difficult to stay "tuned-in" to this book.  A few good ideas, but nothing new or different.  It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point.  I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift 
 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 I was hoping to find info that would apply to my children who have no learning disabilities. I found none 
 I wonder why people who really want to write screenplays try to disguise them as novels.  "Boy in the Water" is a "novel" to be read by airplane passengers who have already seen the emasculated in-flight entertainment.  I was attracted to Dobyns by the NEW YORK TIMES review blurb on his novel "The Wrestler's Cruel Study."  The reviewer commented that the book "stirs together Nietzschean philosophy, professional wrestling, fairy-tale scenarios and Gnostic speculation to produce what is at once a darkly humorous and gravely unsettling work of imagination."  At the same time, I ordered "Boy in the Water," and it arrived first.  Now I am very apprehensive about reading "The Wrestler's Cruel Study," because "Boy in the Water" stirs together many different varieties of schlock to produce one of the most moronic things I have ever read.  If the NYT review is at all accurate, perhaps Mr. Dobyns decided sometime in the 1990s to abandon art for garbage.  He does, after all, have three children to send to college.  Let me turn from general commentary to some specific remarks on the "plot," such as it is.  Dobyns depends on the stupidity of his readers.  (Of course, the fact that the albino in "The Da Vinci Code" could fight off the French police and carry his dying mentor to the hospital with no further police intervention counts heavily on reader stupidity, and that book sold millions.  Maybe stupidity is a trend?)  Much of the "Boy in the Water" plot is based on the one bad guy (#1) paying another bad guy (#2) to commit a heinous act.  Now it stands to reason that, by paying #2 to do the deed, #1 would be interested in staying as far away from #2 and the scene of the crime as possible and in keeping his relationship to #1 tenuous at best.  Yet, in advance of a raging snowstorm, #21 comes to a town near the scene of the crime and walks out in public with #2, AND, in the middle of the raging snowstorm, he subsequently rides out to the actual scene of the crime to deliver the rest of the money to #2.  In fact, #2 even confides to another character that he was going to be able to use #1's SUV as a getaway car.  Where's the logic here?  It doesn't exist.  Unless you're stupid.  Another amazon.com reviewer commented on Mr. Dobyns' "Church of Dead Girls," and his or her objections can be overlaid almost exactly on "Boy in the Water."  This sorry excuse for a novel, whose title does not even resonate in the rest of the book, is just another in a long list of examples of screenwriting gone bad or bad screenwriting gone worse.  Still, Mr. Dobyns' children should be able to go to the universities of their choice.  Just hope that they don't enroll in his creative writing classes.     
 Ms. Blee has many flaws in her research, documentation, interpretation and conclusions. At worst this is a conscious manipulation of fact to support Ms. Blee's preconceived thesis. At best it is a work of pure fiction 
 Although I'm a fan of her other works, I found this album extraordinarily flat and unexciting.  The music is mostly trite, with little energy or passion, and much of it sounds like it was turned out on a cheap keyboard synthesizer.  Most disappointing of all, the focus here is not on her violin work, which is sometimes hard to pick out-- if it's there at all -- but on vocals and other pieces which are pleasant in their own way...but not what you buy a Vanessa Mae album for. Pleasant background music, inoffensive, but with none of the spark that makes her other albums so great, and many pieces that are little more than violin-assisted disc 
 This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters! I really don't recomend this one...at all!    P.S. Don't buy it, watch it or... anything else that is similer. What a snoozer, twenty bucks is such a loss 
 There may be a point about many college professors being liberal and not conservative, likewise there are legitimate arguments about things like affirmative action,  but like most liberal-bashing books this goes way overboard into the hysterical, such as using the term "brainwashing." GOPists are mad because universities haven't capitulated to them like the mainstream media, and that they still question them and teach things that are true without afterwards "balancing" them out with right-wing nonsense. If they had their way, universities would be "fox"-icized, further contributing to the intellectual decline of America.  If you want brainwashing, just turn on Fox News. In colleges, you're free to believe whatever you like, there are even conservative clubs on campuses. Just because professors usually are liberal (as are most intellectuals) doesn't equate with "brainwashing." And it's funny, I know many people who are Republican who've completed college, I guess their supposed "indocrination" doesn't work that well after all.   If college professors usually hold liberal views (most extremely smart, educated people do), it's not because there's any sort of conspiracy, but because conservative views are often anti-intellectual and put ideology over facts and reality. Many modern conservatives want creationism taught as a valid theory alongside evolution, dismiss real science supporting things they don't find convenient (such as global warming), view dissenting opinions with contempt, and generally hate intellectuals and thinking, educated people ("liberal elites"). If one view makes more sense, and the other is incompatible with academia, it's not the fault of the universities.   I guess if conservatives and Republicans want their views to be taken seriously among academia, they'll have to make it more intellectual and be able to change aspects of their beliefs when they turn out to be completely wrong and unsupported by evidence. They could start by admitting there aren't WMDs in Iraq after all, evolution and global warming are supported by science, and agree that people who disagree with them aren't necessarily evil, pushing a sinister conspiracy, or unpatriotic. It wouldn't hurt to stop hating or at least insulting intellectuals, admitting that maybe people who are experts in a certain topic know more than they do about it. As long as they consider Ann Coulter a cutting-edge thinker, they won't be taken seriously 
 If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.  How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.   If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.  Shameful exploitation of a decent name 
 Anyone with any rust issues should contact Henckels from their website and get a replacement. The blades are guaranteed to be rust free. Don't mention the rusty spring issue or they'll only send a replacement spring 
 This was a complete waste of money!  The ideas were stale and elementary.  Do not waste your money or your time flipping through it 
 I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl.  It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective).  Way too long in my opinion 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 Probably no biography is without some value, but this is one of the two worst Chaplin books published.  The comedian was hardly a perfect man, and there are things about him even a long-time fan might find bothersome, but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors.  David Robinson's CHAPLIN:  HIS LIFE AND ART, published twenty years ago, remains the best way to learn about Mr. Chaplin's complex life and work, while Glenn Mitchell's CHAPLIN ENCYCLOPEDIA I have found very helpful.  This book is best ignored and forgotten 
 This book is very lacking in many types of shade plants that I have used for my very shady property.  (ie. Caladium, Houttuynia and Polemonium to name a few.  Ferns and Ivy are not even listed in the index!!!)  This book is difficult to use.  The photos and descriptions of the plants exist in separate sections of the book with no reference to one another. On a positive note, the photos do include a name below them and are in alphabetical order. Overall, a great disappointment 
 I was not impressed at all with this video. The women who do the various facial exercies do not even smile and scared my son the first few times watching it.   It is poor quality, no originality and there is nothing I see that is going to help at all that I already do not do with my son.  
 John Barnes can do better. Rambling plot threads, links to concepts in previous books not explained for a new reader to this series. I was unable to connect to the characters, and thus finally gave up at page 200 (out of 400) after many attempts to pick it up again, threw on the fire. Sorry Joh 
 Pretentious language and marginally insightful axioms let this book down.  The historical parts are somewhat interesting, but only seem to serve as the author's attempt to give credibility to his ideas on what it means to be a man. The result is a bizarre book full of drivel for gentleman-wannabes who would be better advised to find a different path to man-dom than this silly book.. 
 Another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn. It's fun to watch them die onscreen sure, but it's redundant. I'm not surprised to read it's by the Shark Attack people. They're terrible too, but of course if they make a #4, I will rent it knowing it will be stupid. <sigh&gt 
 Agee was an outrageous bleeding-heart, a man whose life and work were compromised by posturing, mawkishness and complacency in anguish.  The  gush of his prose--the hemorrhaging of that bleeding heart--is deeply, plangently, cloyingly purple. His endless rhapsodies betray a stubborn adolescence that will delight those who see an artist as a perpetual kid and repel those who don't.  Immense suffusions of tenderness are not the most helpful or respectful way of responding to fellow human beings, and they provoke an obsession with one's own feelings instead of their ostensible object.  In this regard, one notes that Agee's tenderness did not prevent him from engaging in serial adulteries and enforced threesomes, devoting his life to personal fulfillment rather than self-denying altruism, and indulging himself to death by the age of 45.  Of course Agee felt guilty about all this (his writing fairly reeks of a rotting conscience), but he saw his guilt as a reassuring index of purity, like the parishioner who sees confession and absolution as a license to go on sinning.  Moreover, Agee's tenderness was reserved for the disadvantaged.  The obverse of this solicitude was an affected brutality of reference to just about everyone else (except family and friends, his favorite artists and his latest lover).  This tough-talking pose, which has not worn well, assumed a moral superiority that the record does not bear out.  Art and morality are not the same thing, but Agee thought they were, and this confusion permeates his work.  Again and again he makes moral claims upon us which he thinks that his aesthetic project will validate.  It does nothing of the kind: it merely aestheticizes.  Agee did possess extraordinary powers of lyric observation, and a sharp mind when he wanted to use it; but aching sensitivity, metastasizing into ecstatic intoxication, tended to distort his vision, soften his rigor and sentimentalize his voice.  He has his devoted followers, or rather his cultists, but one doubts that his place in the canon is as secure or exalted as they might wish, or as this Library of America volume would suggest 
 Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much 
 This may be the most boring book every written about a fascinating subject.  It tells you first how the book will be arranged - page after page after page - and then tells you what the author and other people THINK about the missing gospels without quoting them, except in minor parts.  WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?  Give me the originals.  BORING, BORING, BORING.  DON'T BUY THIS AWFUL BOOK 
 While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative.  The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book.  Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful.  Sociology remains thin stuff 
 I bought this book along with others to aide in writing a business proposal.  This book was one of the least helpful.  It contained review information for basic English and grammar that I was not at all interested-in.  2/3 of the book is fluff,  with little or nothing to do with "business.&quo 
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 This book is a good idea, and presents relatively useful information in a straightforward fashion. BUT: the book as a whole suffers from some elements that make this a mediocre choice. A strong candidate in a long tradition of making business and finance texts unreadable, ruining the subject for millions.  1. Poor prose: the writing is mediocre and after a while gets tedious and annoying. As an example, on pg. 91, a paragraph leads off saying (paraphrased and condensed) 'there are three important additional factors, x, y and z. X must be considered so that (blah blah blah). It is equally important to understand Y. Finally, it is important to be aware of Z.' In other words, these things are important, and you know this, because you have been told they are important through the technique of repetition of the word important. This is just plain poor writing.  There are also pompous quotes at the end of each chapter, which have little relation to the text and no effect save to annoy the reader. They seem to repeat the theme of liberty; now, liberty is a Good Thing, but the connection to a real estate text is somewhat tenuous - and more to the point, it's obnoxious. (Example: at the end of Chapter 3, "Eight Ways to Locate Rental Houses for the Smart Investor", John Quincy Adams is quoted as saying "Posterity - you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it." Wha'?)  2. Narrowness and facts/opinions: pg. 27, "The type of location best suited for rental houses is typically in a neighorhood that is between 10 and 35 years old." Ummm, would this hold true in, say, Boston? New York? New Orleans? Paris? (Okay, it's a book for a U.S. audience, but still). In general, the "suggested approaches" seem targeted at those considering investing in rental properties in mid-sized cities with massive urban sprawl. In particular, there is a strong and clear bias to investing in single-family dwellings, a bias that is both potentially dangerous and certainly open to debate. (Granted, the author does point out that this is a generalization, but this qualification is not very convincing.)  3. Errors: while the errors I have found are not serious, they worry me when I read a business/finance text. For example, on pg. 75, Berges explains the debt servicing ratio and states that "a value of 1.0 percent means that there is exactly enough cash to make the loan payment." Actually, 1.0 percent means that there is 1/100th of the cash needed to make the loan payment - a typo, to be sure, but that's why texts are edited prior to publication. The box on the same page breaking down the formula is also simply wrong.  I should note that the entire section in the Chapter "Financial Analysis of Rental Properties" makes use of an almost unreadable print-out of an Excel worksheet (that I have not found available on the web, although I admit I could eventually read no more). Since some of the text following this is based on the worksheet, it makes it harder to get through this section and the subject just does not come alive.  4. Nothing new: there are other texts that explain finance and real estate much better, and put them in context, with clearer examples and less painful writing.  Keep looking 
      Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.      Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.      I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order 
 It just goes on and on about things I don't care abou 
 This is one of the best children's books ever written but it is a mini version of the book and was not portrayed as one.  It is over priced for the product.  I sent an email regarding my bewilderment  to Amazon and got no response 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 The teacher who teaches this is an enviromentalist wacko and this book can be used solely for that purpose 
    This HGW novel is not as satisfying as his more famous  sci fi pieces, but it is representative of turn-of-the-century interest in galactic exploration.  Related in the first person by an impoverished would-be playwright, Mr. Bedford (for whom no first name is given), the story opens as he makes the acquaintance of an eccentric scientist named Cavor in a coastal area of England.  Gradually persuaded by the latter's dreams of conquering gravity by means of a substance he will eventually invent, Bedford soon becomes an enthusiastic convert to theoretical astronomy; he injects some practical ideas-as well as his private dreams of avarice and proprietary empire.  Ah, the temptation of creating one's little sphere of power.       Embarking on an odyssey in a sphere made of Cavorite the partners in adventure land in a crater on the moon, where they encounter odd vegetation which flourishes during the two-week lunar day.  But even more amazing is their discovery of a species of intelligent beings (described by Cavor as ant-men) who dwell in the moon's interior.  When captured the two men fight their way back to the surface, but become separated.  Assuming that Cavor has been killed by the native Selenites (Cavor;s term for them),  Bedford manages to return to Earth, but the story does not quite end there.  What is the source of mysterious transmissions from the moon and--equally curious--what causes them to cease?  Wells' protagonists express the author's commentary on man's propensity for warfare and injudicious zeal to modulate alien civilizations due to our anthropomorphic egocentrism.  Nevertheless, this book offers great sci fi lore which will appeal to kids of all ages!      
 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 I'm an avid reader who takes pleasure in spending (too much) money on books.  Catherine Coulter, being that she's one of my favorite authors, takes up a large amount of space in my book cabinet along with Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag, and Patricia Cornwell.  However, I've noticed Ms. Coulter's losing a bit of her pizzaz when it comes to her more recent works.  Before I read this book, although in honesty, I have yet to finish it, I was elated upon seeing that it would soon be in stores.  I went to her website each and every day for the longest time, in hope that she'd post a preview as she always does.  When I read about Ruth's adventure, I was excited and determined to purchase the book with all haste.  Especially after witnessing the panic she was feeling.  However, once I'd begun reading Point Blank, I realized she'd put everything she had into a powerful beginning and not so much into the rising action.  To say in the least, I'm disappointed.  I'm currently stuck, for lack of a better word, on chapter twenty-one because I've been straying from reading this book.  Instead, I've enveloped myself in the wonderfully written novels Julie Garwood has provided.  I hate admitting the fact that although Coulter started out as my favorite author with novels such as The Maze, The Edge, Riptide, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, and Blowout, Julie Garwood is beginning to pull ahead with her brilliant works.    The dialogue in this book is so forced, along with the jokes and relationships.  I took a bit of a peek ahead and witnessed a kiss between Ruth and Dix that was both expected yet unexpected.  You see, he kissed her in a rather awkward moment.  The dog had just wet himself (and her borrowed leather jacket) when Dix decides this is the time to kiss her.  I'm sorry, but who does that?  There was no indication, from what I saw, at that moment to suggest he even desired kissing her.  Yes, it's bound to happen eventually- the two of them realizing they care about each other.  But at such an awkward time?  With no warning or no hint of what he'd been thinking or seeing?  It was certainly a moment I'd like to forget because it's one of the worst moments she's written thus far between two characters.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed forced, as are the relationships, jokes, and laughter.  I don't understand exactly what happened to my favorite author, but I sense this is perhaps a foreshadowing of the worst.  
 I'm an avid reader and usually really enjoy chick-lit as a fun, escapist read. I expected to really enjoy this book. I don't know if it is because I tried reading it while pregnant myself, but I just could not identify with this character. In fact, this is one of only two books I've ever just not been able to get through. I found the main character annoying, ridiculous and just plain shallow. I mean, if the author had found some really compelling reason for the main character to fake her pregnancy (which maybe she did, but not in the first 1/4 of the book), I might have liked her. But instead the main character just seemed shallow and I just couldn't root for her, or even continue reading about her. Too bad, the premise seemed like it could have made for a really fun and funny read 
 takes "Armis virumque" and gets "I sing of warfare and a man at war"?  The consensus in the reviews is that Fitzgerald has written a fine epic.  It just is not the same one written by Virgil.  If you want to read Fitzgerald, this is the book for you.  If you want to read Virgil you need the Mandelbaum translation 
 this DJ plays music that I can hear in a bus, in the subway or even in the slumberest parties! I just hate that he and his music is the most comercial in the entire planet earth. Come on boys, put some bad reviews, was not helpful? your so not into this kind of music, that can tell 
 Don't waste your money on this book! It does have a few useful bits of  info but if you think you could build a gun using this book, think again.  The black and white photos were so over exposed that you can't make out any  detail, the drawings were so faint that half of them couldn't be seen and  nearly all of them didn't have any dimensions.I'd suggest Gerard Metrals  book "A Do-it Yourself Submachine Gun" if you have access to  machining equipment.It's packed full of prints.Also try Bill Holmes later  volumes 3, 4, and 5. He did a much better job on those 
 This book teaches you almost nothing about the way to make the head shape- just exepects you to be able to make a perfect egg shape.  Then it expects you to be able to magically draw perfect features.  Then somehow it gets colored with perfect highlights and shading.   I don't recomend this book at all for beginners or people with intermediate skills.  ... 
 like any compilation, there are a variety of theories that are good, not so good and poor. most of the contributions sound good, but have no practical value. it would be nice to have jobs which help us be mindful, skillful and fulfilled. but let's face it. most jobs are low paying and unfulfilling no matter what frame of mind one should place themselves in. it's all nice ideologies from well-known (and successful) zen authors. this book does not help you explore right livelihood as much as mocks your efforts to try. this book is akin to those get rich infomercials which state "if i can do it, you can too". get this from the library or don't get it at all. don't like my review? check out how many used copies are for sale. i rest my case. 
 This doll is cute to look at... until you use it and it begins to grow mold on the material. I took extreme care with this doll and it still grew black spots on the material. My daughter loved having a baby doll in the bath, however, the shower part never stayed together and was just a frustration.   I have to replace this doll have only having her for a few months because of the black spots (mold). Maybe I'll try the water baby that got good reviews.  Very disappointed in the quality! 
 This is literally the most useless text book I have ever encountered (and I really thought I had read the worst). It is COMPLETELY USELESS.It doesnt explain basic concepts and examples skip mutliple steps on their way to the solution. And by multiple I mean I cant follow them at all. Please, if you are a teacher, DO NOT use this book to teach Junior Meche's. Everyone in my class thinks this book sucks 
 I love Julie Andrews and really wanted to like this fiml.  But this?  1.  The character of Gertrude is never really developed.  Why should we care about her? Indeed, Julie Andrews seemed uncomfortable with the part and after awhile the character becomes whiny and annoying. Julie doesn't seem to have erased Maria von Trapp and Mary Poppins from her psyche.    2.  Too long.  Three hours for this mediocre story?  The musical numbers are much too long and add nothing to the character development.   3.  This is so sanitized -- are theater people in London really that bland?  4. The dialogue is incredibly trite and banal.  You can't go through 10 minutes without hearing Julie say "bloody this" or "bloody that."  Bloody hell, Isn't England known for its writers?  5. It's conventional message is anachronistic for 1968 (heck, even 1928).      Buy the DVD and keep it for background noise when you feel nostalgic for souless British bunk 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 I am very disappointed in the book  The book is written poorly, very dry and expensive for what you get.  It really isn't a good reference guide there is no glossary or chapter listing.   The best information I have on Anatomy is the DVD by Paul Grilley Anatomy for Yoga.  
 Proof that anyone can write a book.  Do not waste your money on this -- it is worthless.  You can do better by asking yourself about your time management faults and coming up with your own solutions.  This book has nothing of value.  It is full of typos and ridiculuous quotes. 
 This is a worst book I ever read. Also it is not written by Jerry Seinfeld but forwarded by him. And I picked it up because of Seinfelds name. This book lacks humor. Its no way at the level of Larry Davids or Costanzas character. The chapters are just repetetive. Crappy letters and stories can be very humorous, but that humour is completely lacking in this book. I am giving it a 1 star because that is the lowest I can go. Avoid this. It is a waste of time. Broth must try a bit hard for his next publication. Seinfeld shows that he can be a loyal friend by giving a forward to this book, I guess, without reading it 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
  And censorship is sometimes the best thing that can happen to a movie.  Case in point SS HELL CAMP, a `video nasty' that contained scenes of such perversity it moved a nation to impose sanctions to protect its citizens from its baleful influence.  And that's just the stuff that'll get chumps like me to line up around the block to take a gander.   Well, peek away, and try your best to stay awake.  The Germans are occupying a town, a band of partisans are blowing up bridges, and the bad guys are rounding up the wimmen folk for interrogation purposes.  The chief Nazi doctor on-site is a gorgeous brunette with a dominating air and a caged, half-human, sex maniac in the cellar.  To make them talk, the women are either sadistically - and graphically - tortured (a bad thing,) or they're thrown naked in the cage with the neanderthal Casanova (a very bad thing.)   More than half this movie, the half that's spent with the intrepid band of partisans in the field, is impossibly boring and can't be watched without mashing the fast-forward button.  The acting is atrocious and the scenes in the field run on forever.  Besides, the whole point of the movie is to linger over the shoulder of the beautiful and twisted Nazi doctor.      I'm sorry, this movie is supposed to shock and disgust, but it is done so poorly it's impossible to take it even half-seriously.  Its worse scene involves a number of women undergoing a number of tortures.  One woman, strapped to a table, is supposed to have been cut open, her entrails exposed and gnawed on by rats.  Supposed to have been, but the stage blood was gruel thin, you could see her intact stomach underneath it, and the red sawdust on top failed to convince as innards.  Plus, the `rats' on her stomach were a couple of overweight guinea pigs, who scampered away as quick as their pudgy little legs could take them.  I gave this movie two stars for the unintentional laughs it provided.  SS HELL CAMP is a nasty little exploitation movie, although I'd call it silly rather than shocking, and pretty poorly made. 
 I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this 
 I read through the 700 pages of this book, including the mathematics, hoping at some point that the Nobel Prize-winning Sen would have something to say about Rationality and Freedom. Alas! I was disappointed. About 500 pages are devoted to an almost entirely vacuous "social choice theory" and in particular Kenneth Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. I was thinking maybe that Sen was doing a "reductio ad absurdum" and at the end, he would offer an alternative approach. Unfortunately not. The salaries of the thousands of academics who are paid to do this stuff should be collected and distributed to poor people in developing countries. A far better use of the money 
 Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.  The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.  With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like.  Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.  After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.  The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
 While this book may contain some good information on multicultrual education I find it difficult to get past the bias presented in it.  Based on statements like   "A crucial fact in understanding racism is that whites see themselves as superior to persons and groups of color, and as a result exercise their power to prevent people of color from securing the prestige, power, and privilege held by whites."   and  "Whites go through a developmental stages as they develop their racial identity and abandon racism."  The authors seem to presume that all whites are racist, power hungry, pigs.  Knowing that such a generalization is patently false how can I trust the content describing peoples of other cultural backgrounds 
 I got about one third of the way through before giving up on this book. Without knowing anything about the author, it seems like a romance novelist trying to write a mystery, and I think readers of both genres will be disappointed in this book.   This is my first Amazon book review, from an avid mystery reader who hopes to write more reviews to help others as I have been helped by these reviews. I am not overly critical of books and if it's an enjoyable read, that's what matters to me. I won't spoil the plot, but will give my honest opinion 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 This book is a perfect introduction to the wealth of hiking possibilities in patagonia - many of them are still significantly under-used and of equal calibre to the more famous routes. The general information sections are quite good, and give a good feel for what conditions are like both trekking and travelling in general; a good purchase for planning your trip. Where the book falls down is on the actual trekking notes, which are consistently inaccurate, obscenely outdated and sometimes quite misleading (see other reviews). On this front, Cerro Electrico is not safe - however Cerro Electrico Oeste is safely climbable without mountaineering equipment (although crampons are a nice idea) and gives mind-blowing views of the rear of Fitzroy - I think this might be what the author actually had in mind.  The best use of this book is as an introduction/inspiration, then get hold of decent military maps (plentiful in santiago and buenos aires) and local advice (abundant) and go from there. Given that many of the treks require some degree of independence and judgement (especially in snow-bound regions), pretty much any information should be taken with a grain of salt and certainly should be double-checked independantly or at worst against common sense. It is a pity no better alternative exists, but the general information is good and if prepared, leave the fun of route-finding up to yourself 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 I don't normally do reviews on items because I am aa easily pleased person. But, I had to do this so that other people don't make the same mistake I did. This book is awful. The disk has tons of forms ALL of which are either bogus writing which is hard to undersatnd OR are TOTALLU useless. Plus, they are done SO POORLY that a high school student could create a better document.  The book is nothing but forms and fruity language. It really gives a BAD name to the coaching profession. I think it is a noble life path and I happent o be on it. After reading this I am afraid to think that some coaches use this as a guideline for their work. If my coach spoke this way to me I would be offended and feel like I was being used for money.  I HOPE THAT NOBDY WHO SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS BECOMING A COACH USES THIS AS ANY SORT OF A GUIDE! 
 I returned this book.  It is boring and seems very old fashioned.  More like a textbook than a parent guide which was what I was looking for 
 The fuss over Forrest Gump still amazes me. This movie basically rips off better movies in almost every scene. Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light 
 I finished this at 11 pm and almost got up to write a review to warn others.  Absolutely dismal.  It's unfortunate, though, because this writer does seem to have talent but the characters are stagnant, the plot is drawn out far too long and the ending!  I actually kept turning pages to see if where the rest of it was!  It's like she ran out of enthusiasm for the story and just decided to kill off the storyline.  That being said, if the author worked a storyline with more ease and CONCLUDED the story instead of abandoning it, I think there is potential - just not this book.  Shudder.  Can't wait to return the book to the library.  (Donnette and Ellis are so unlikable!!! - NO GROWTH! 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 I was all excited that I could put any solution i want in it and that it had a scrubber, but when i got it.  It was so hard to put together.  Then the cleaner i put in started to leak. Then the handle part kept on coming apart.  Then it didn't look right.  The mop pads are a joke, they don't just come off when you turn the knob which i can't even do that.  It does not take any mop pads because the swiffer wet jet mop pads are my fave and I had to put velro on the bottom so that they would work on it. And most of all the thing is so heavy.  You have to have some upper body streanth just to move it. The scrubber head is no were near how big it look on Tv.  It was a very big dissapointment not to mention it was my Xmas present to my self.  Black and Decker should stick to power tools and leave the mops up to swiffer.  I love my Swiffer wet Jet.  Best Mop I have ever used.  Wish they would make it so i could use any cleaning solution that i wanted though 
 "Big Fish" is the most horrible movie ever. The only reason i couldn't go any lower than a 1 is because it can't go lower than a 1. I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BUY THIS EVER!!!!!!! 
 I actually picked up this book in my church library.  While, I'm wary of christian romances, this one caught my eye.  And I loved it!  Dee Henderson's writing style is fun and her charachters are okay.  She deals much more honestly with the realities of the world then other romance novels.  Having read almost all of her books now though, I have to say that they are dangerous for young women.  Every book is a romance with God playing a distant second to the man and woman who are falling in love.  In all of them that I've read, the formula is exactly the same.  Man or Woman of God meets Woman or Man who is not a Christian with a personal battle to overcome.  Get them together through some sort of danger fall in love.  Even before the non-christian converts though, while the christian is saying that they can't date them, they still kiss and pursue each other.  This teaches young women 1. That it's good to pursue a non-christian-after all maybe you'll convert them. 2. That physical reletionships are okay with non-christians, even if you can't date them. 3. That a non-christian will inevitably fall in love with Jesus if you want them to.  I'm going to ask my church to remove it from our library.  A great alternative is Shaunti Feldhaun's two novels The Veritas Conflict, and the Lights of Tenth Street.

 Sacred Causes is the second book of 2 devoted to the conflict of religion and politics in recent European history.  The first volume, Earthly Powers, was devoted to the 19th century and this one covers the 20th century.  The quality of both books is uneven.  This is a huge topic and Burleigh has not attempted the difficult job of a systematic analysis or structural overview.  Like Earthly Powers, Sacred Causes is essentially a series of chronically arranged essays on aspects of the central topic.  This approach served Burleigh well in some of his other work, notably his excellent book, The Third Reich, where he could incorporate a continuous narrative as a unifying armature for his essays.  In both Sacred Causes and Earthly Powers, there is only a general theme and the quality of the essays/chapters varies significantly.  Some are very good, some indifferent, some actually poor.   The best parts of Sacred Causes are the opening chapters in which Burleigh discusses the great, and greatly destructive, `political religions' of the 20th century.  These are Marxism-Leninism and Fascism.  As Burleigh is quick to point out, the description of these ideologies as `political religions' is not novel.  This concept originated decades ago and has been used by quite a number of scholars, not least Burleigh in his fine work on the Nazi state.  The political religion idea describes these secular ideologies as having the structural features of a religion with promises of individual and communal salvation, rescue from conditions of social degeneration, charismatic-prophetic leadership, and a strongly millennial flavor.  Burleigh's analyses of these features of Nazism, Communism, and Italian Fascism are vivid and very well done.  He has particularly nice descriptions of the efforts of the states adopting these ideologies to develop explicit ceremonial and public experiences aimed at displacing the rituals and experiences of genuine religion.   Burleigh follows with a considerably less successful effort to describe the responses of European churches to the challenge of political religions.  This simply is too large a topic to be dealt with appropriately in the space allowed in the book.  He concentrates primarily on the Catholic Church, and even more narrowly on the Vatican.  Burleigh takes pains to present the Catholic Church as a foe of the emerging totalitarian regimes of the interwar period.  While this is true in several important ways, it is also misleading in other, equally important senses.  It is clear from Burleigh's text that true to its 19th century heritage, the Catholic Church in many European countries was no friend of liberal democracy.  His account shows clearly the preference of the hierarchy of many countries and of the Vatican for traditionally oriented, authoritarian states.  Burleigh attempts to gloss this over by describing the Church as having a choice between totalitarianism and weak democracy, but this obscures the negative role played by the Catholic Church in some of the weaker democracies of Europe.  His own account of the Partito Popolare Italiano, the ancestor of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, shows that the Vatican preferred accommodation with Mussolini to bolstering the foundations of democracy in interwar Italy.  Burleigh never discusses the changing role of the important German Catholic Center party in Weimar Germany. Under the leadership of Ludwig Kaas, a priest close to the German hierarchy and the Vatican, the Center Party ceased to be a pillar of democracy and Kaas led the Center Party into accommodation with the Nazis.  Burleigh has a particularly one-sided discussion of that historiographic lightning rod, the Spanish Civil War, where his commentary will probably satisfy the most dogmatic defenders of General Franco.   There is a concerted effort to defend the wartime behavior of Pope Pius XII. Burleigh does well in defending Pius XII against charges of antisemitism and indifference to the fate of the Jews.  Burleigh does less well in defending Pius against the most serious charge against the Pope; that Pius failed to exercise the moral leadership expected of the Vicar of Christ.  Pius spent his career in the Vatican diplomatic service before ascending the Papal throne.  At a time that required prophetic moral leadership, he was a cautious diplomat.   The remainder of the book is devoted to a series of chapters of varying interest and quality.  There are very good descriptions of the post-WWII assaults on the churches of Eastern Europe.  Other chapters describing the secularization of Europe in the 1960s, the role of churches in the end of the Cold War, the persistent problem of Northern Ireland, and the recent 9/11 tragedy are not so good.  A lot of this discussion, for example, the denunciation of cultural changes in the 1960s, and the hagiographic treatment of the roles of Reagan, Thatcher, and John Paul II in the end of the Cold War, is trite and inaccurate.  The chapter on Northern Ireland is a rhetorically interesting combination of attention to detail and tendentious sarcasm that veers into actual bigotry.  Burleigh has an unfortunate tendency for nasty and irrelevant asides that disfigures many sections. This book also has signs of being written hastily.  Parts of the concluding chapter are simply hard to follow and there are a number of careless statements.  Does Burleigh really believe that the USA has no social welfare system?  There are a surprising number of factual errors throughout the book.  Contrary to what Burleigh writes, the Civil War President of the Spanish Republic, Azana, was not a Socialist, Pol Pot was not educated at the Sorbonne, and the US Supreme Court has never banned prayer in US public schools.  All in all, a very disappointing performance.  
 I love biography. I never thought I would abandon a biography unfinished and feel no desire to pick it up and continue. I found this dull, self-serving and boring.   Lessing seems to be busy making excuses and justifications for her 'fellow travelling' with Communists in 1950s London.  Oh, pleeeze! So what? Heaps of people were members of the party or fellow  travellers. many have also renounced or reassessed their former positions,  but they don't feel the need to go into tortuous self-denial as Lessing  does.    I find her cold as a person - that's fine, one doesn't have to  LIKE the subject of a biog/autobiog to be interested in them. But her  writing is cold and detatched as a cold-water flat in misty wintry London 
 Seems to me that not too many people have read that book: the ratings are either "I hate it!" or "I love it" - with NOTHING in between......Fishy, isn't it? I my opinion, people who have read it hate it, and book pushers rate it highest. Shame. Read "Alcoholics Anonymous" and you will see the light. Useless, untrue book 
 Roll and move, roll and move... and dogs?  What a lame theme.  Ptooey 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 I should have known better. People were telling me to use dermaAction from www.topicalbeauty.com but I wasted my money on Hylexin instead. Saw no results. DermaAction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now. Next time I'll listen 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 These guys have been playing the same tired old stuff ever since I first saw them.  Stanton is an awesome drummer, but the songs written by the other musicians are absolutely stale and without imagination or  inspiration.  Be sure to miss this band 
 It's time to retire this old book which is amazingly rigid in its decorating ideas and its school-marmish, rules-oriented approach to design. Decorating today is so personal, yet Martha (or this old book, anyway) seems to think that there is only one way to do things. It reminds me of a 1950s book filled with rules for the little housewife to follow, but it certainly doesn't fit the world of today's educated, style-conscious, and confident consumer. Bleah 
 to basic ok for sailboats not much for other riggin 
 I expected good things from this book, but was surprised to find it offered very little useful advice.  The examples of what to do in certain situations must have been jokes, they were that inappropriate and irrelevant to real life.  Amazingly, the book was also racist at times, making odd comments about Muslims.  I actually tossed this book in the garbage, a first for me. 
 the big brother documentry part was great the janis live stuff is very poor quality sound and picture buyer beware 
 I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like "Prime Cut".  You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.  This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's "Lew Wasserman" type production deals 
 I have returned the shirt from amazon/macys. I did not like it and I am still waiting for my refund. I purchased it in January. Where's my refund. I will not buy from companies that don't offer free shipping. I was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back.                               Ms. Michelle Watso 
 This album (video material not included) should only be purchased by people that own any other Atreyu albums. Yeah, it's because they are leaving Victory, but if you own any of their three major releases, you already own one third of this. It doesn't even have "Her Portrait In Black", which may add some form of redemption to its purchase being as it's not really available on an album already. If it's your first Atreyu album, go for it. If it's not, leave it be 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 Player's Handbook II is a waste of time and money.  It is a disappointing mish mash of lame executions of potentially interesting concepts 
 We should all be for Mr. Ravi Batri.  By selling enough copies of this book and its sequel ("Surviving the Great Depression of 1990"), he singlehandedly prevented worldwide economic collapse 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.  It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea.   For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.  I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit. 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
  Kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever. He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.   I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5   DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie. 
 The evil genius series of electronic hobbyist books tends to be a mixed bag of quality. Sad to say, this is not one of the better books in the series. It is way too elementary for any adult remotely interested in the science behind the hobby. For example, the chapter on rocket math is junior high school level and the chapter on the flight computer was woefully inadequate. The book is also short on explanations in general, and I found the illustrations to be lacking. If you want a really good book on model rockets, might I suggest the updated version of the "Handbook of Model Rocketry" by Stine and Stine. The senior Stine, G. Harry Stine, was a range safety officer at White Sands Missile Range who built and flew various model rockets in the 1950's and then devised a safety code for the activity based on his experience at the range. The instructions and diagrams are very clear, and the authors go the extra mile with technical details that are missing in Harper's book. The following is the table of contents for the Evil Genius book on rockets:  Chapter 1: History of Rocketry  Chapter 2: Rocket Science  Chapter 3: The Model Rocketeer's Workshop  Chapter 4: Model Rocket Stability  Chapter 5: Constructing Model Rockets  Chapter 6: Recovery Systems  Chapter 7: Launching Model Rockets  Chapter 8: Rocket Math  Chapter 9: Model Rocket Photography  Chapter 10: Model Rocket Movie Cameras  Chapter 11: Rocket Mail  Chapter 12: Introduction to the Flight Computer  Chapter 13: Educating with Model Rocketry  Chapter 14: Model Rocket Clubs  APPENDIX A: MODEL ROCKET SAFETY  APPENDIX B: INTERNATIONAL LISTING OF MODEL ROCKET CLUBS 
 Did not like this album at all.  Poorly written and musically a failure.  No wonder this guy trashes other artists 
 I went to used my today.  It was on the stove, I was canning some meat.  When the time was up, I went over and shut off the stove.  Next thing I knew I was on the floor.  IT BLEW UP, HAD GLASS AND MEAT EVERY WHERE!!!!!!!  Had to go out to the ER.  So if you buy, be very carfully.  It might blow up on you.  I had steam burn's on face 2 drgeer and many cut's.  Thankfully I had my glass on, so my eye's was not hurt 
  This story is about a misbehaving six-year-old who colors on the walls, throws temper tantrums, makes faces, destroys her dolls, and for all intensive purposes acts like a two-year-old. She is extremely spoiled (and after waking up her nanny announces that "Nanny has to get up and pamper me and spoil me for a while). Parents might object to the condescending way she treats adults and her distain for education. (She has a private tutor who is "boring boring boring" who she doesn't listen to "very often.") Throughout the story she repeatedly says "Oh my Lord!" which some parents may find objectionable. The story is presented in a grammatically incorrect, stream-of-consciousness writing style from Eloise herself, that, if you are able to suffer through it, leaves you craving a well-written story about a much nicer (and more coherent) child than Eloise.     
 This product does not make you hair grow at all. Im so freakin mad it is such a lie it makes your hair grow..........IM SOOOOOOOOOOOO MADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
 This book is pure trash.   Don't waste your time reading it, because it is a demonic lie. I was there and witnessed this unsuccessful attempt to destroy God's true religion by this demon called: Joseph Tkach Jr.!  God's true religion does continue to live on to this very day, and will to the very end.  Purchase and read: "Raising the Ruins", by Mr. Stephen Flurry, and learn the real truth about how it all happened.  You need to know where it is today 
       What is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that Fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24.  Nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced "The Great Gatsby" a mere five years later.           "This Side of Paradise" is a mess: it is as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young Minnesotan-gone-to-Princeton Amory Blaine.  (One suspects, in fact, that had Fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as Amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable, at least.)         That the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it.  Okay, Amory Blaine may well have been the original Jazz Age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and Princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an American audience raised on McGuffy's Readers -- and ready for some sort of Great Departure after the Great War.  Welp, here it comes:         "On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with that great current American phenomenon, the `petting party.'        None of the Victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were Victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed."   To the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer.  What was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases of the Paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. While this is not exactly Fitzgerald's "fault", so to speak, it is also true that the use of "shocking revelations" of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes.  In any event, the price the reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds Amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent Roaring Twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such modest proportions.  I mean, come on:   "For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart.  The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it.  Eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept close to Amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes."  Yikes.  I don't care what New Generation you're talking about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody?  (Can it represent ANYTHING to anybody?)         There are things to like, even admire, here and there in Paradise.  Fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., "They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered." "Sometimes I wish I'd been an Englishman; American life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy." "It's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.")  And the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way, refreshingly, bracingly funny:   "Slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while Amory talked and dreamed [which is about all Amory ever does-MHT], war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where Princeton played.  Every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings.  When Amory went to Washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back, for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-Greeks, he guessed, or Russians."  Nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, I always say.           Anyway, most of the novel consists of young Amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable.  I've forgotten them already. At some level, in any case, Fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself.   For how else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to take this observation?   "Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.  Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours."         In the end, in any event, one comes back to the initial Fitzgerald vs. Fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder.  In Paradise almost nothing works: form, content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development, pacing -- you name it, it's a problem.  Yet in Gatsby, five years later, everything works -- everything.  If there is to be a Great American Novel, it will have to supplant Gatsby for the honor.  While it is hard to see how Fitzgerald got from point A to point B, the fact is that he did -- and without point A the journey could not have begun. So while "This Side of Paradise" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led to. 
 I had to read this book for a college course, sorry to say.  Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't have gotten through this entire mess.  The authors have about three common sense points to make and take about 100 pages to  make each of those points.  I'd like to know what qualifies them to write  this book anyways.  Bottom line is it's a complete waste of time 
 I'd been wanting to read this book for a while. Finally picked it up yesterday, made it through almost 200 pages on the plane, and gave up. Maybe I've just been spoiled by The Mists of Avalon, which is one of the best books of fantasy I've ever read. Or maybe I was too fresh off reading one of the greatest books in all literature, The Grapes of Wrath, which I'd finished just a day before starting Guenevere. I just found this book immensely difficult to get through. I can't remember the last book I read where I had to force myself to turn the page to get on with the story. Arthur comes off as a silly little lovestruck frat-boy incapable of making up his own mind, and Guenevere is a simpering, ineffectual idiot. In general, the description of their evolution of their relationship is not believable. I didn't make it far enough along in the book to be able to relate more about other main characters, but from what I've read from other reviews, it doesn't look good for their portrayals either.  The prose is also, for the most part, insufferable. I found the descriptions of the characters' actions obvious, trite, and repetitive. It was also jarring to veer between rather graphic descriptions of Merlin's lustful thoughts to Guenevere's constant, Harlequin-y "Oh Arthur! My love, love, I love you." Gag.   In short, not recommended, unless you really have nothing else better to do 
 An older book, recently republished, by the author of the Pippi Longstocking books, The Red Bird is the story of Matthew and Anna who have very sad days with a mean farmer in Myra until they find a door in a wall that leads to Sunnymead and happiness.   A modern young reader will not stay with this book long. Both its repetitive and lengthy text as well as its dully colored illustrations do not entice one to contine reading past the halfway point.  And although there is a happy ending, the reader is left feeling sorry for Matthew and Anna, not rejoicing at their freedom.  I do not know if Lindgren meant this to be so, but the story has the very strong feeling of being a metaphor for life on earth versus an after-life in heaven.   Unfortunately, not destined to be a classic.  
 this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything. i didn't even like the story. i would give this book a big fat ZERO if i could!! 
 I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup.  Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed 
 My first disappointment with this book was that out of 348 pages, the last 112 pages are credits, acknowledgements, and pages upon pages of vendor lists ranging from calligraphy to ethnic artifacts.  I could not believe when I got to page 236, the credits began!  My disappointment was complete when I turned to the Winter section.  I am having a winter wedding and thought this book might provide some ideas on winter wedding receptions.  Not so... The chapter focuses on a single home wedding.  I had hoped the book would cover pictures and ideas of multiple wedding receptions.  I was so disappointed that I wrote this review.  It's the first and only review of a book I've ever written.  Don't waste your money on this one.   
 Typical of a Ripley's Beleive It Or Not book, there are no refrences.  It is a collection of cute trivia from the older Ripley's Believe It Or Not books.  Problem is, most of what can be checked, is wrong.  Frank Wells was never on the Titanic nor the other ship disasters claimed.  The section on laws includes myths and jokes that someone believed.  Stories from older Ripley books are re-told with different names.  It even says "Mushrooms are a fruit." (They are actually fungi. 
 Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.  And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.  Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.  1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster. 2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism. 3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.  The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.  For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.  In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different. 
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 Would be 5 stars but for his rhyming about the Jews controlling the media on the track propaganda 
 I'm really dissapointed with this guitar. I just bought it and after 3 days of being tuned the bridge cracked completely. Sound was nice but for using the guitar only during 3 days, it's non acceptable. I made sure that string were not overstressed and tuned with electronic tuner having just the top 3 sets of strings (D,A,E) tuned an octave apart (The G was tuned in the same octave) to avoid stress on the guitar. But even with that, the bridge cracked. The wood on the bridge is not rosewood but a low quality wood, that was the cause of the damage 
 This book appears to be useful only for secondary teachers.  That was not stated in any of the information about the book and I would not have purchased it had I known.  The author should have thought of that in the title, since its not what every teacher needs to know, but only secondary teachers.  Its was not useful at all for people at the elementary level 
 The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere.  I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending.  Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull.  It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me 
 I spent the $$$ for this supposed miracle product a month ago....don't waste your money...absolutly NO results. 
 Carter wins on giving us numerous minutia about Blount's life and his odd selection of friends. But her book was not of great interest to a reader who was aware of Blount's peculiar nature and interest in art. It is difficult to understand how Blount or his friends, seemed completly oblivious of politics as Carter has laid out. Unless she is making the case that Blount was the perfect mole - at all times on guard against exposure. But I don't think she is trying to make that case.Carter gives us a blur of names, quotes, and a failure to find mention of expected comments in corresspondence such as the passing of Blount's father. It may be Carter's intention to show Blount's world as an extremely focused life which was hardly influenced by outside events; such as the end of World War One and the rise of Communism. I suspect Carter is trying to explain Blount as a Good Boy Who Does Bad Things 
 This(and other Cooking Light books)definately need a better way to organize the recipes. The book doesn't even follow the order of the monthly magazines recipes. It is severely lacking in photographs. Most of the beautiful photos from the magazines are not used in the cookbook. The photos would be helpful in selecting recipes...especially because the book is not organized by food category.  The recipes might be great, but who has 2 hours to search through a cookbook to find something to cook? 
 From and anonymous reveiw printed in the "British Critic" for July 1824 on Hogg's "Confessions": "There are three good reasons for reading books: first to be instructed by them; secondly to be amused; and thridly, to review them. The first does not apply at all to the tale befor us; as to the second, there are but few whose taste it will suit...;the third carried us through with that proud conciousness of martrydom for the public good, to which we are but too much accustomed when labouring in our vocation." 
 IF YOU HAVE EVER WORN A REAL BOWLING SHIRT YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THIS SHIRT.  IT IS THIN CHEAP MATERIAL AND WORKMANSHIP.  GRAPHICS ARE THE SAM 
 I will keep this review short and simple, as a book of this genre really doesn't warrant much thought or criticism. I bought this book as a result of Karla Homolka's recent release from prison. I have followed the story a little on television and the internet and feel that this book adds nothing to the things I already know. The Amazon review touts the book to be well-researched and written, but I completely disagree. This book, like many other crime books, is cliched, repetitive (so, tired of scences in which Paul rapes a girl -- the language IS exactly the same every time and it isn't a stylistic choice, it's just sheer laziness of this hack writer), and boring. I suppose I will finish it, but it's the type of book that makes you feel guilty about reading it(like watching Jerry Springer or reading US magazine), since it is a total waste of time and so terribly written.   So, if you are interested in this strange criminal case, I wouldn't bother purchasing this book. The only positive thing I can say about it, is the introduction by Kirk Makin. It's misleading, as he isn't a bad writer, so he sets you up for a terrible disappointment when you read the actual author. 
 IS THERE an element of paedophilia in the new feminism? There does seem to be an awful lot of it about these days. The coffee-table bible which provokes the thought is, of course, Germaine Greer's 2003 book The Boy, a somewhat iffy collection of pictures of pre-pubescent lovelies from life and art, an illustrated paean of praise for the beauty of the young male presented as a feminist rallying cry for women's right to ogle under-age male totty.  According to the cover line, the book set out to demolish "one of the last great Western taboos" (not the one that says adults should curb any lascivious feelings they have towards the sexually under-age, but the sub-clause which, according to Greer, represents an oppressive restriction on grown-up women). Greer said she was out to "advance women's reclamation of their capacity for, and right to, visual pleasure."       Well, I'll remember that line if I'm ever caught exposing my long lens from under a dirty mac outside the school gates. Just looking, officer.   The book has been described as "endearingly dotty". However - packed as it is with the sort of images that, if they were of young girls and discovered on the hard disk of an ageing rock guitarist, would have him in the News of the World and on the sex offenders' register faster than you could say: "Hope I die before I get old" - "frankly dodgy" might have been a better description.   Ironically, of course, with The Boy, Greer was unwittingly supporting the sexist proposition that a woman's sexuality is not to be taken seriously; it is too weak to be predatory (not for nothing was "nothing" Elizabethan slang for the vagina) and besides, the Mrs Robinson syndrome is a male fantasy, right? Boys welcome such "seduction" as a rite of passage.   The ghost of the damned phrase "contributory negligence", idle since it was rightly exorcised from rape-case courtrooms, lurks stage left, and was heard clanking its chains again last week. Now, I know it isn't done to have a pop at other columnists, but in the case of Minette Marrin in last week's Sunday Times I am prepared to make an exception. Marrin's article posed a curious defence (under the headline "A prisoner of sexual double standards") of a female teacher who had been jailed for seducing a 14-year-old boy with whom she had embarked on a six-month affair. While conceding that what she had done was illegal, Marrin mounted a wondrous apologia for Hannah Grice, the female teacher, and concluded that the law had been a "misogynist prig" in giving her a 15-month prison sentence. The lad, you see, had been "very willing " and it wasn't as if his 32-year-old seducer was actually the boy's teacher, just a teacher at his school. Besides, she didn't really seduce him - it started because he developed a crush on her. Virtually his fault, then.   Marrin acknowledged: "As an underage person, he could not legally have consented", but then added: "but it seems that in everyday understanding he did." Anyway, she wrote, "boys of 14 vary; many of them are sexually mature young men, suffering not from shyness but from sexual longing".   Well, that's all right then, case dismissed. Male children, it seems, are not to be given the same level of protection as girls from predatory teachers, so long as the teacher is a woman (despite the fact that the amendment of the Sexual Offences Act in 2003 made it a criminal offence for a teacher to have sex with a pupil under 18, let alone 15). Can you imagine the outcry if I defended some 32-year-old male teacher who'd been convicted for giving some flirty 14-year-old Lolita extra biology practical after class? No matter how much she'd been "asking for it", Sir would have been in breach of a basic trust.   In June a 25-year-old female teacher was charged with having an affair with a 15-year-old boy. She walked free with a suspended sentence even though the judge said: "If this was a man, prison would be inevitable. You do not send your 15-year-old son to school for him to be seduced by his dancing teacher."   As the 26-year-old Canadian supply teacher Amy Gehring told a startled Sarah Montague on the Today programme in February 2002, after she was acquitted of indecently assaulting two brothers at a Surrey comprehensive: "I think society probably doesn't think it's as bad . . . these boys weren't stupid. They knew what they were doing."   Women, the poor, harmless creatures. Even when they've transgressed, one can't blame them. 
 We received a set of 3 Junie B Jones as a gift.  We read Toothless wonder together.  I was really SHOCKED that a former teacher would use such horrible grammar in a children's book.  "we ran real quick to the window" , using "me" instead of "I", using words such as 'worser' and 'worstest' and "ain't".  This is NOT what you want your children learning.  It really is a shame because the story was kind of cute with a recycling theme and that the tooth fairy recycled teeth into baby brothers.  A much better series is the Magic Tree House series of books-adventure and history/geography, proper English!  If you are looking for humor, even the captain underpants books differentiate between the comic books that the boy characters are writing with incorrect spelling and the real narrative that has correct spelling.  The Junie B. series presents the narrative as if it was correct.  I had to use a highlighter and correct all the grammar--EVERY page of my son's book has corrections on it.  Really sad that a teacher would write this 
 I have read or tried to read a number of Laymon books.  For some reason I always feel the need to shower afterwards.  However, I have enjoyed a couple - Blood Games was entertaining and I loved One Rainy Night. This one I did not enjoy.  I tried twice to read it and gave up both times.  If you've never read a book by Laymon - this is not the one to start with 
 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 This book is gross.  Yes, it was informitive, but it also was sick, and I would not recemended it to anyone in the world 
 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 If the demented 13-year-old offspring of the unholy union between David Lynch and William S. Burroughs were given pen and paper and told to write a trippy story splattered (and I don't choose that word lightly) with blood, gore, zombies and sex, Baby Jesus Butt Plug is what you'd get.  Unfortunately the outcome will still suffer from the story telling of a hormone laden 13-year-old boy.  To illustrate, imagine a depraved pre-pube making up a wild sex-fi story on the fly, while his wide-eyed buddies eat up his every absurd word.  It's stream-of-consciousness story telling with all manner of shock and awe thrown in for effect.  On the other hand, the beginning and end of the story contain flashes of satirical brilliance, biting humor and quirky sci-fi-esque fun to offset the crude writing and story line.  One passage that I found particularly clever and amusing is when the narrator talks of getting a free Baby Jesus Butt Plug from a couple who just want to make sure the BJBP goes to a good home.  He says, "And when they said `a good home' all they really meant was they didn't want to give them to anyone who would stick them in their butts".  I wish Mellick had pursued the socio-religious angle of owning a BJBP that began to take form in the first third of the book.  Or he could have explored the conundrum of losing oneself physically and mentally in a sea of one's own clones.  Either way would have made for a much more powerful and coherent statement.  As it stands, the story begins to provoke and stimulate but quickly deteriorates into a menage-a-bizarre story of teen male angst, desire and fear.  I've read other Mellick works and know that in a lengthier format he can make you blush, throw-up and ponder in the matter of one short paragraph.  So I am comfortable in saying that this is not his best.  However, if you want a unique insight into the stuff of which adolescent boys wet dreams are made, then Baby Jesus Butt Plug will take you there. 
 On the cover of this book is the warning:  "This title may offend some readers."  It wasn't the title but the language used by the writer which is offensive.  She is apparently from Georgia, a Southern state, but her resentment and low view of the wealthy and educated people show her status in life.  Even though it mentions such Confederate generals as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate states at the time of the Civil War, (and Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States at the time), the only thing about Dixie is the theft of a diary purportedly written by a Civil War madam.  It reminds one of the movie IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL which also takes place in Georgia what with two murders by a prominent collector of antiques.  Our investigator is a 'has-been' with the police department and now cleans houses for a living.  She is crude, calculating, and not very professional.  Not at all what I thought I was getting into, but a slight diversion off the path of knowledge.  At a recent talk about Nathan Bedford Forrest, a UT professor called him white trash, which I refuted most vociferously as he not only hadn't done his homework; he had Forrest as being from Memphis, and he was born in Chapel Hill, TN, (not too far from Shelbyville, home of the Tennessee Walking Horses), who proved to be one of the most brilliant officers and calvary tacticians of that war 
 The concept of "Rumspringa," in which some of the world's most conservative people run wilder than most of us ever do, is fascinating.  Then why is _Devil's Playground_ so boring?  The beginning is amazing, when we get our first glimpse at the debauchery of an Amish youth party.    The rest of the film, unfortunately, is pure tedium, as the filmmakers focus on a few kids who stray rather far into drugs and other vices, but who just aren't very interesting.    One in particular, a crystal meth dealer and user, gets endless attention, and we just see him ramble about nothing much for minute after minute.  The fact that he was formerly Amish does not make his pathetic life much more interesting than that of the next white trash loser.  Another Amish drop-out is a girl who appears to have serious emotional problems and who decides to go to college.  That is all I learned about her in the movie, and it could have been conveyed in about 30 to 60 seconds.  Instead, the director goes back to the girl again and again to pad out the film's running time, even though she has nothing additional to tell us.  Meanwhile, we are not given much context for any of this.  Do most Amish kids stray this far before coming back?  Do some not stray at all?  Do the adults really just sit idly by for all of it?  After seeing this movie, I have no idea--I just know about a few kids who fell pretty far from the tree, and who aren't very interesting in themselves.  It seems many of the Amish shown here do not reflect typical Amish/Mennonite ethnic traits, which goes unexplained.  It is also clear that some of the Amish people we see, including the adults who allowed themselves to be interviewed on camera, are from substantially different Amish sects.  So does this stuff go on among all the Amish, or just in some weird group of Amish, or what?  The film never explains.    Other things irritate, such as use of the same soundtrack music over and over.  Why the filmmaker thought the electronic music of Aphex Twin was the best choice to represent the "unplugged" world of the Amish, I don't know.    The footage in this film could have been used to make an interesting 15-minute news magazine segment.  It does not work as a (barely) feature length documentary 
 This "book", if you can call it that, is a waste of money.  It would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it.  Instead, I would recommend Harry S. Dent Jr.'s book, "The Next Great Bubble Boom."  Both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn, but the Dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it 
 I have found the leaking problem for the fountain.  It is the filter.  It will somehow block the flow of the water, so the water starts to accumulate and then you have a leak.  
 I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. Will this company stand by its product like that? I doubt it... For a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... It's a scam.. 
 A pseudo intellectual recommended this for our book club.  Others voted for it because they liked Lolita.  This was the hardest book I have ever had to grind through.  There are sections that are beautifully written but the majority of it dragged on and on.  At the end, I asked myself, "Why do I care?"  I dont think you should 
 First I'm going to ask the author something: Why, WHY, did you call this book "Friday the 13th", when has absoloutely nothing to do (except Jason) with the rest of the movies. Another New Line-author who's totally missed the point.  First of all, only 0.1% of the story takes place at Crystal Lake. Some soldiers then captures Jason (ehh, am I the only one who can see something's wrong already?) and the rest at the story take place at FREAKING COSTA RICA!!  Second of all, the first 100 pages Faust does nothing then descripe each characters life-story in details. Guess how many times we see Jason in that part of the boke (- and how many he kills).  Also, it's poor writed, the kills are nothing much (except some few), and the whole zombie-fact just made me wanna rip the book into pieces.  I'm not saying that you're a moron if you liked this book, but if you did, you have not understand what "Friday the 13th" is all about. Like I said: Good read for others, terrible crap for hard-core fans.  1/5 
 These are short essays on 100 of Roger's favorite movies. Even though Roger has studied many of these films shot by shot there is no thorough deconstruction of these movies. Most are 3 page essays with synopsis and commentary on themes. But, serious film students can learn from this as well as the layman.  This IS a great book by a movie critic who I agree with less than half the time. Lately, I think Roger has seen one too many movies. He's not as discerning as he once was and he's far too forgiving of a lot of the mediocrity that's foisted on us by the Hollywood Money Machine. I disagree with his recent assessment of movies such as SPIDERMAN 2, KILL BILL VOL. 2, SIN CITY, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and THE CLEARING, which was the worst movie of 2004. But, if you think he's just a Pop Culture movie critic, think again. He's won a Pulitzer prize, and his commentary for the CITIZEN KANE DVD is a must hear for any serious student of filmmaking.   I DO agree with his inclusion of almost all of the classics listed here. Some of his favorites are also mine. On DVD, I own 42 of the 100 films he essays here. Some I call "movies," some are "films." His taste mirrors my own in many ways. Especially his love of black and white films. And his love for Oliver Stone's masterpiece, JFK. But, for different reasons than Roger states here. Roger has changed his opinion about this film after his initial review because he received an undeserved tongue lashing from Walter Cronkite, who apparently knows nothing about the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and was probably mad because his 1963 broadcast likeness announcing Kennedy's death was used in the film without his knowledge. Now Roger says he loves it for it's "mood." Shame on you, Roger, for revising your original statements concerning this great film. I love JFK for the sheer force of it's propaganda, for being more right than wrong(Stone did his homework on this film), and for Kostner's performance(I cry every time he gives his final court room summation. So did Kostner when his was reciting the words. It's Garrison's actual speech from the trial, which Roger fails to mention here). It's also a marvel of film Editing and changing film stocks; which IS touched on by Roger. It's easily the most important film of the 20th Century. Because of it's controversy, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, mandating that records be opened to researchers from the National Archives(what's was left of them, anyway. Oswald's files were completely destroyed). But, in recent years Roger has backpedaled on it's importance.   Great old movies that might go unnoticed by modern MOVIE GOERS are treated as essential viewing for FILM LOVERS(the distinction is mine, not Roger's). A lot of people have seen SEVEN SAMURAI, but how many people have seen Kurosawa's emotional masterpiece IKIRU? Hopefully many more now that Roger has written an essay on it. Other great inclusions are: THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, DETOUR(a rotten low-budget B FILM NOIR), Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT(I'm an Elvis man myself, so I would have thrown in JAILHOUSE ROCK too), LE SAMOURAI, Charles Laughton's only directorial outing, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER with the great Robert Mitchum, Disney's PINOCCHIO, Astaire & Rogers SWING TIME, Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, Wim Wender's marvelous art film WINGS OF DESIRE, Ozu's FLOATING WEEDS(personally I would have gone with his tearjerker TOKYO STORY). And the best inclusion is THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, with it's odd and bombastic dialogue. It's one the most elegant pieces of FILM NOIR about bottom feeding rats ever written. And Roger knows it. Bravo!!   My only hope is that Roger will reassess Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. This film is GONE WITH THE WIND for my generation. It's a masterpiece that I call the SISTINE CHAPEL OF CINEMA. To see this film and not be completely moved by it, is like going to Vatican City, seeing the chapel, and saying, "Eh, it was alright." It's belongs in one of his books.  I just ordered THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC from Criterion after reading his essay on it. I've never seen it and Roger has me intrigued.   This book of essays deserves a WHOPPING 5 STARs. But, the reason I'm giving this one STAR is because the PAPERBACK fell apart in my hands after getting half way through it. A reviewer below had the same problem. THE BINDING IS TERRIBLE.  DEFINITELY GO WITH THE HARDBOUND VERSION.  ENJOY. 
 Honestly, I should have been able to identify with this author.  Both parents from Appalachia, with alcholism on both sides of my extended family.  I spent some time in Miami as a youngster.  And I grew up to be a professor!  I thought that I should be able to identify with this character!  But alas, that was not the case!  Donald Antrim has got the be the most self absorbed person on the face of this earth.  This story was painful to get through, not because of the depressing subject matter, but because of the monotony of the pathetic way in which he continued to NOT deal with it.  Honestly, we all have our lot in life to deal with.  He has obviously decided to continue to follow in the footsteps of those who raised him and NOT face up to the possibilities that life might hold for him.  It is a shame.  I find his writing mediocre at best.  That he has been endowed with numerous awards for writing is beyond me.  If this is representative of his best, it just leaves me thinking that surely there are more deserving writers out there 
 Sometimes a title says it all, and Madam Secretary is essentially the sum and substance of Albright's claim to fame. She was the first woman Secretary of State and probably one of the worst Secretaries of any department in any era. Admittedly she worked for a morally bankrupt man who governed based upon what the polling data showed, but this book reveals that the ship of State was rudderless and without a compass.  If the titles "Clueless" and "Sleepwalking through History" weren't already taken, they would have been much more apt descriptions of Albright's tenure in such serious posts as Secretary of State or Ambassador to the UN. The initial chapters were interesting in her personal history as her family moved from Czechoslovakia and to the USA, but it was all downhill after that.  I kept turning hundreds of pages looking for some substance or recognition of her true impact on world events but couldn't find any. Her refusal to be "baited" at the UN and defending the USA by rabid haters of the USA and instead making jokes about how it made her feel "young again" was telling. She glosses over the North Korean violation of the "framework" negotiated between the new Clinton Administration in 1993 and 1994 by the peanut farmer and never acknowledges that this "framework" was violated by the North Koreans from day one, but somehow blames the Bush Administration for calling an end to this charade by revealing the fact that the North Koreans never lived up to their commitments. The bombings by al Qaeda of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania the year that Osama declared war on Western Civilization? No connection that she had anything to do with it or the impact of the US tepid response. What about Clinton hiding behind her skirt and sending her out to defend him when he lied to her and the nation about Monica? It was all Ken Starr's fault. Arafat lying through his teeth about Palestinian terrorism and using the White House as his platform? Not a problem. Rwanda and the greatest genocide in modern history since Pol Pot as hundreds of thousands of Tutsi's were hacked to death? Boys will be boys, and besides, the UN didn't want to get involved. Any thought about how Saddam built billions of dollars of palaces under the Oil for Food program that she supported? An audit program? What and upset the French who were collecting the billions involved in the program thru Paris banks?. Mon Dieu!!  This book is much more spin than substance, but I actually think that she doesn't recognize the difference. If you want to know why we were so highly thought of by the enemies of freedom, you can read all about it here. We were very, very nice when we should have been very, very determined. If you want to know just how the world became such a dangerous place on her watch, you might be better off saving the dollar I paid for this book and asking some wino on a park bench. Most have them have a better understanding of the real world. The Freudian analysis of this book's title is that she may have been the biggest Madam in Foggy Bottom while she was in charge of the house located there called the State Department. The problem is that she is probably unaware of the fact that it may not necessarily be a compliment.  
 My best rating for Microsoft Money Deluxe is it is pure JUNK. Don't was your money. If it works at all, trust ,it is not with Microsoft Vista. A class action law suit sounds in order for this GARBAGE 
 I am a big fan of Rita Ciresi, so I went out of my way to find this one. This was her first literary work, a collection of short stories. It is just plain weird, and darkly sad. Awfully written. I can't imagine how it won the Flannery O'Connor award. Rita Ciresi's other books, especially Pink Slip and Blue Italian are so much better. I've been trying to unload this on ebay for a long time now and no one will buy it from me. Can't say I blame them 
 The author sells herself as a concerned teacher but what is obvious from the book is that she is just another businesswoman trying to sell some vague pontifications to the general public 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 First off, this title is not right. It would be better if called "Best Of" because KCi and JoJo only had three significant hits and those were "All My Life" Crazy" and "Tell Me It's Real." "All My Life" was one of the best R&B ballads to come out of the late 90's, but the other two resembled pale imitations that revealed the duo desperately trying to live up to that monster single. They succeeded someone considering both singles got pretty decent airplay ,but nothing will ever top "All My Life 
 The old version of this book had 16 pages of index.  This version of the book has only 3 pages of index.   Not happy. Fre 
 Quickly I will say that in buying this book I felt I was going to be reading about the Nazi doctors and their crimes. Instead I read a book about a young lady whom was a court reporter during some of the trials and what she saw/heard.   True some acounts are harrowing and emotional but not enough to live up to the unworthy title of "Doctor's From Hell".  I had a few friends whom stated they wished to read this book when I was done and I told every single one of them that it isn't worth their time. I'll tell you the same. There are plenty of books out on this subject that give you a real sense of what happned and the evil people whom were responsible.  I was really hoping this book was going to live up to expectations but sadly it did not 
 Before I begin the review, I should take time to mention that I am a huge baseball fan. I rarely miss a game, follow it as if my life depends on it, and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than I do movies. I also played when I was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater.  I had heard that Bull Durham was one of the best, if not the best, baseball movies ever made. As a fan of Field of Dreams and The Natural, I decided to go and rent this one. Figuring that it was about baseball I thought I couldn't go wrong, so I didn't check the ratings on any of the sites as I normally do for a movie. Big mistake on my part there.  I couldn't even make it through a half hour of this movie. There was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning. The entire thing was about sex, and I had to look away from the TV for some time. I was hoping it would get better but it never did, and after all the sex and foul language I stopped the movie, never bothering to finish it.  I was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings. Looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie, it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters, who I did not like at all, seemed to persist. Unfortunately this movie is filled with sex, and I feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release.  I'm not some kid writing this, I am a mature conservative Christian. This movie should offend anyone who believes in Him. Don't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one. Go and watch a real baseball game--always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment, plus it's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be 
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 I eagerly awaited this album, ever since hearing Mr. Mitchell sing in the Kiss Me Kate CD. His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is. I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances. 
 the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady 
 I got this book at the library's used book sale and am definitely glad I didn't pay full price for it.  The plot summary on the back cover sounded interesting, but the book itself did not live up to the description.  I stuck with the book until the last page but only because I wanted to find out how it ended.  I didn't think the characters had much personality and I couldn't get myself interested enough in them to be enthusiastic about following their story.  Not a total waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 Well, it appears I'm one of the only ones to dislike this book, and it's by my favorite author, too!  The only good part about it was that it starred my two favorite people *ahem* characters, Tony Hill and Carol Jordon. There is no real mystery, as the killer is revealed immediately. Despite the opinions' of others I didn't find the book particularly scary, either.   The best part of this novel was when it was over, so that I could start The Last Temptation, the third, and, in my opinion, most amazing, Tony Hill/Carol Jordon novel 
 This really didn't help me understand the mind of lesbians.  It was poorly written or acted or presented or something.  I was looking for insight to try and gain appreciation for the lifestyle so that I could better understand the culture, but was left with a silly sex movie.  Very disappointed.   I regret the purchase... should have gotten RENT instead 
 This book should actually be rated with less than one star as it wastes the paper it's printed upon. What a shame that such a cultured and intelligent woman should waste her time and talent in such drivel. Jorie Graham and Helen Vendler from whose covoluted cranium she was born, truly deserve to go down to the "Ninth Circle of Hell" together.  Vendler declares openly that she has never belonged to anything or voted in an election for anyone and she should be ashamed of herself for that. To make no political statement is to be a "Pontius Pilot"--a self involved act that is political in its denial. This is selfish and uncommitted, hallow, straw-man's poetry. The sort of convoluted nihilism and over intellectualized theorizing about language, poetry, and art of which this book is born is a detriment to all poetry and its readership. This sort of hopelessly abstract book will help to toll the death nell for American poetry's readership. It's utter foolery and we are not fooled. There is nothing here for anyone human. An experiment is supposed to discover something. This experiment, if it is one, discovers nothing. Que piccata! A wasted talent! A wasted effort at publishing 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 The metal pieces on the sides looked like they were going to slice my cat's throat!  threw it in the garbage 
 I truly enjoyed all of the other Rich Dad Poor Dad books, but this one is awful.  I have recommended all of the books to a number of my close friends and family.  I will have to warn them all of this book.  You know, you can knock them all out of the park though. I still will recommend that everyone should read Rich Dad Poor Dad at the very least 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records ("Most Overrated Celebrity").  If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book?  So dies a noble institution 
 Alright, so maybe a dollar is a little steep for this, so just send shipping costs and you can have it.I couldn't even watch it all. It's unauthorized because no director, producer or Nickelback themselves would authorize its' release. No music,terrible documentary and not worth .10 cents. This is the worst DVD in my collection, but, I only own 674 of them ! This is only my opinion though, buy mine and decide yourself 
 If you're looking for a dumb book to waste your time with, then this book is just the ticket. You'll notice that the author's friends in the "self-help/success" book industry all gave the book 5 stars, but people who actually bought the book say it sucks.  The self-help industry is, unfortunately, largely populated with individuals who are less than perfectly honest. They ALWAYS give each other' books super-great reviews, thereby scratching each other's backs so that they all can sell more books and make more money.   When one reads these reviews with a critical eye, one notices that they often don't say anything very specific about the book itself, which is usually a strong indicator that the reviewer hasn't actually read the book. You'll notice that most of the information contained in these reviews can be gleaned from glancing at the books table of contents, and sometimes the review focuses on the author without really describing the book at all. These also are telltale signs that the reviewer hasn't read the book.  In closing, this guy has published a whole series of similar books which purport to tell everyone how to be successful in life and handle any situation. What makes this guy an authority on life? Try reading one of his books & you will find the answer to that question. He isn't an authority on anything. He's just a guy with a lot of time on his hands whose trying to make a living without having to actually work 
 The trouble with Alistair Horne's "Seven Ages of Paris" is the set of expectations it raises and then fails to deliver upon. Naturally, when picking up a history of a given city, I expect to get a narrative that concentrates on the subject. But too much of this book is taken up by generalized history of the French nation, with only incidental discussion of the impact of wider events on the capital. Admittedly, France has become such a centralized nation in recent centuries that it is tempting to take country and city as intimately intertwined. Yet I'm not sure this was always true.  The book is also oddly stingy with illustrations and maps. The growth of Paris would seem to present all sorts of opportunities for vivid illustration (check out the Musee Carnavalet in the Marais for several hundred candidates for inclusion), but all we get here is a few sparse city maps and a few pages of glossy pictures 
 I recently purchased this DVD recorder from Best Buy. It was an open item so I got it for a good deal. Initially after I set it up I was pretty happy, after I started watching tv and recorded a show, I realized I got a piece of junk on my shelf.   It looks good and the hardware is high quality. But here are the bad points.  1. It takes a very long time for the recorder to turn on, and almost 15 seconds to eject a DVD.   2. The display that says what show is on and what channel it is reappears every 5 seconds.   3. I recorded 24 last night, and tried to watch it later. While it says in the manual and I know that some programs are copy protected, 24 was protected for almost 70% of the show. It wasn't normal increments either. It was totally random. Most of the show was cut out, and I just saw a grey blank screen.  Overall, I was extremely frustrated with this dvd recorder. Its possible it was just a bad unit but regardless I just went and exchanged it for the Panasonic DMR- ES15. 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 I fell in love with Robin McKinley with the novel Beauty, her first write of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  It was an amazing novel, and I was excited to see she had rewritten the tale a second time.  Rose Daughter, however, falls sadly short of McKinley's other work.  The writing style is difficult and choppy to follow, too many sentences are strung together to make the words flow smoothly.  This was the greatest drawback to the novel and made it much inferior to Beauty.  At the story's finish, you realize the novel has only spanned a few days, but it felt like centuries to wade through McKinley's over-wordiness and failing attempts at a more "advanced" writing style.  What is more, Rose Daughter isn't different enough to even have points for originality, or a very clever plot.  I would definitely suggest against purchasing this book, and instead sticking to Beauty 
 Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a "catty" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the "ignorant natives" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real.  Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf 
 I love travel adventure books.  I especially like anthologies.  As much as I expected to like this book, I was disappointed.  Perhaps I am more atracted to the adventurous aspects of traveling, rather than relationships and emotional ties these authors focused on.      
 Cheap mixture of basic body language knowledge and psychology catered to the masses. Very shallow and some of its comments show a unbelievable degree of narrow-mindness (Comments like "if you look like this, you are like that" are all over the book). Very disappointing book, comments like "If someone speaks about sports a lot, he probably likes sports" (page 63) say it all. 
 This book simply throws ideas out that are simply ridiculous. I think I'll be lucky to make use of more than 2 or 3 of these monsters. The only ones that are remarkable are the new giants (and seriously you'd have to plan a whole campaign to make these fit somehow). Unless you like to throw random monsters at your players (which is a lame way to DM and is even more boring than fighting the same monsters again and again) this book is just too bizzarre. I'm agonna avoid MM4 too. With this trend, the new monsters could be nothing other than preposterous 
 We have had the LeapPad Plus Writing for a couple of years now.  When it works it is great my kids love it.  The Durabily is awful!  We are now on our 5th or 6th pen for it.  This must be a problem for most of them since the last time I called the company they autimatically stated on one of the phone options that you can get up to 2 free pens for it (with the cost of $5 s/h for each pen -another $10 bucks down the drain when it actually only costs them probably a $1 to ship by mail.)  The pen is so sensitive sometimes it seems to work ok then others like on the bones of the body- you can touch on the bone and it will give you the wrong answer.  The books are a lot of fun and educational but we paid $80 for this when it first came out and we own probably 7 book ($15 average per book)and if the Leap Pad isn't working the books are a waste).  The last time I used this with my son and it started off working fine then all of a sudden the pen wouldn't recognize anything.  I called the Co. and they told me they would give me 1/2 off a new Leap Pad plus Writing book.  I thought that was kind of stupid considering I already have one that obviously isn't working and wouldn't spend money on getting a new one that will have the same problems.  They suggest when having problems with the pen to clean the prongs with alcohol - this has never worked for me.   It might be okay to buy if the pen wasn't attached to the book because it seems every little tug you need a new pen.  I am debating on getting the new Leapster L-max, but am worried that it will also have problems.  Very disappointed in the LeapPad Plus Writing 
 This is your standard, generic, run-of-the mill comedy, with Ben Stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc. and Jennifer Anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible.  Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.  If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, "oh, that was supposed to be funny", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?  Are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them, and they act like a complete loon?  I mean, come on.  This crap was old when they were doing it on the Carol Burnett Show 30 years ago.   Anyhow, if you're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight, brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time, then you'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else. It's probably better than reruns on the Cooking Channel, but only by the slimmest of margins 
 I suspect folks read the Cliff Janeway series because they enjoy peeking into the fascinating world of Book Dealing.  Or because they enjoy learning more about books & the publishing industry.  Or because they enjoy Cliff Janeway's dry, self-depricating humor.  Alas, this book doesn't deliver on any of these expectations.    Good characters and a couple of strong opening chapters show what the author can do ... but then it's as if Dunning starts piling so much fat on the bones that he loses sight of the skeleton.  (Perhaps he is being paid by the word or page?)  Plot lines fizzle and disappear, interesting characters are abandoned or disintegrate into stereotype, logical inconsistencies become increasingly glaring, and long passages of history or pseudo-history are substituted for plot.  This book promises to be an engaging romp of a story about finding a lost trove of precious books.  Alas, the trove fails to engage the reader's interest (Dunning never gives us any reason to care whether they are found or not), and the pursuit is almost an afterthought.  This book promises a wonderful (albeit fictional) "reveal" in which Richard Burton, the famous British explorer, effects the course of the Civil War.  But the "reveal", when it comes, is improbable, uninteresting, anachronistic, and tedius.  The opening chapters contain fascinating insight into the world of rare book collecting.  But before you can blink we find ourselves relocated to the Land of Melodrama, where bad guys don't need a reason to be bad, romantic relationships are convenient rather than logical, and good guys indulge in fantasies of exacting bloody revenge (but never actually do).    In short, I suspect people who enjoy this series will find little in this outing of what attracted them to this series in the first place.  I, for one, will have to think twice before giving this author another try.    
 Admission to America's elite colleges is an increasingly trying affair. An academically strong, middle class high school senior with no particular claim on a space, "un-hooked" as it is known, is faced with increasingly long odds of acceptance. The "un-hooked" applicant is squeezed by a dynamic made from increasing applications as more high school seniors go on to college and the colleges' own efforts to expand the applicant pool through increasing financial aid as well as recruiting international students even as they hold the number of places in freshman classes unchanged.  In this environment it is hardly a challenge to find a really sharp kid who was not accepted and also to find some "hooked" applicant who seemed rather less than qualified who was accepted. Venting on this situation provides a good release.   Golden vents well, but is unfortunately short on substance. Lacking quantitative data, the scope and scale of the matter escape Golden.   More importantly, Golden does not attempt to address what seems to be the most pressing question: What do we expect of these elite institutions? Do we require that they be social engineers? If yes, to what degree? Failing  an attempt to answer this question "The Price of Admission" is reduced to a voice only of frustration and angst.  For a more thought provoking read, see Harry Lewis's "Excellence Without a Soul". Lewis is not specifically concerened with admissions, as GOlden is, but Lewis is very much interested in the question of what an education at one of these elite institutions should be. 
 The first thing I did when I got this book was to look up what the author had to say about the Moynihan Report (thinking that based on the subject of the book the author would have many interesting criticisms).  Alas, all that existed was a few sentence dismissal.  After that I couldn't take the book very seriously and just jumped around to various things that I found interesting.  Some things were interesting, others were foolish.  
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 I love the idea of these but they're a pain. The plastic plunger sticks so tightly inside the plastic sleeve that getting accurate measurements is difficult. I finally oiled down the plunger and that helped, but it's a definite work-around. I've gotten the kitchen art stainless steel set in the hopes that it will work better 
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay.  They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life.  After wearing them for less than a week, I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin.  There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes.  As you walk, it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable.  I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product.  
 This may be a very essential book for hard core cooks who have a lot of money to buy the grocery's needed. I read it and made one recipe from it. The book has been sitting on my shelf ever sence. There are many other, books out there that are better then this one 
 I expected fast and flavorful recipes that might fit into a low processed carbs, high protein diet.  For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me.  Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it:  more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat.  (I've never said I wasn't picky.)  If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket.  I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying.  
 My 3 year old came to me with a screw and 2 other pieces. I figured it came from a toy but could not figure out which toy. Then today she comes to me with her skate in 2 pieces. Then it hit me which toy the loose screws were from. I also have a 10 and a half month old who crawls around on the floor and puts things in his mouth. I can only imagine what might have happened if my 3 yr old did not give me the screws from her skate. Anyway, she can't skate with them on. She falls every five seconds. This product is very unsafe and should be recalled 
 I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter.  I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly. 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 This book was terrible and I put it down after the 4th chapter.  I've read some of these authors before and expected much more than they delivered.  The story is hokey, there are too many dull, unlikeable characters, and it was just a really unenjoyable read.  This type of writing exercise rarely works outside of a classroom, and it definitely didn't work here 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 For a biginner to intermediate triathlete looking for information, this is not the"book".  It's a glorified blank logbook.  The author even states that much of the needed information is in almanac -3 which you can purchase separatel 
 I love Alice, and I love low-budget works full of heart, but this production was so relentlessly mediocre that I just couldn't bear to finish it. The songs are lifeless and as poorly paced as the rest of the performance, and the script lacks any spirit; overall this production adds nothing new to the story, yet fails to convey the charm of the book (or, for that matter, nearly any other production I've seen). As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD itself is unimpressive - the chapters are, as near as I could tell, either random or simply timed, without regard to content. If this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood, it may be worth something (unless the DVD transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me); if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere. 
 This book was one of the worst reading experiences I've had.  I can't imagine how the information in this book could be useful in any way.  The contributors are long-winded and never really say anything substantial, probably due to poor editing.  STAY AWAY! 
 They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking. 
 Read other books and find that this is for people in the maybe 70's! It is not interesting for my 2004 life. Don't be fooled by the horror stories and read other books that depict the good points and bad points but not just the bad 
 About the only thing this album is worth is the inclusion of the original mixes of Boyz N Tha Hood and Dope Man. They aren't that drastically different than the versions that appeared on Eazy-Duz-It and Straight Outta Compton. There is also the lame clean version of 8-Ball (NOT the original song, but a clean, radio version, which is only interesting in that it was on the D.O.C's "It's Funky Enough". This hodge-podge was thrown together by Macola more-or-less to make some money off of NWA, whose future at that point was up in the air because Ice Cube was off at college. The songs came from the "Boyz" 12", the "Panic Zone" 12" and were rounded out by D.O.C.'s Fila Fresh Crew and the song "Scream" by Rappinstine, which was later replaced by "A Bitch Iz A Bitch" when Ruthless got the rights back to this album in 1989. (That song was originally on the Express Yourself 12" and is now a bonus track on "Straight Outta Compton" as well).  This is interesting more or less for historical purposes, but there's nothing on really that's all that important. Aside from the original mixes of "Boyz" and "Dope Man", this is for die-hards only. The rest is 2nd rate typical early/mid 80's generic rap, which gives no indication of what would follow. 
 I do not recomend this movie. It is very slow and boring. If you want to see Helen Mirren's best work, rent "Calandar Girls." Don't waste your time with "The Queen. 
 Not nearly up to the level we'd expect from Mr. Rogers. The pictures are dated and unattractive and the text is boring and uninformative. Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume  originally published years ago, and seems  old-fashioned to today's  children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and  effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND  PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving  out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers'  book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their  children's expense 
 Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler.  Most toys, though, hold an excitement for him.  This trike lost his interest after one try.  Scuttle the trike I say, or let it become unmoved furniture in your home 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 Brendan and his friends are so shallow I was bored reading it. Is that all he's about,tripping? I guess so 
 I tried out this book and found it to be very vague. It tells some of the different types of travel but doesn't give you any specifics. It honestly isn't much help if you are actually planning to go to europe. It also mentions too few different ways that you can stay such as backpacking and such throughout all the different countries. It gave very little info on anything. Then at the end to take up space they rate and give short descriptions of damn near every restaurant in europe. Just to fill up space since this book was just about useless! If I were you I'd skip over this book and find another one that fits your needs the best 
 This book was really boring to read for me.  It spent a lot of time trying to define what pain was and all, and then it went to this big list of alternative treatments - they just listed all the possible treatments, but they didn't evaluate them further, they didn't show how effective each treatment was, you were like supposed to guess one - try it and if it helped you great and if not then try another one.   - then the whole premise is to block out the pain mentally, but the problem with pain is there is usually a reason, and just because you haven't found the reason doesn't mean there isn't a problem.  I like the idea of refusing to acknowledge it and let it dominate your life and conversation - giving it more power than it needs, but the book doesn' do a good job dealing with that either.  it just plain lacks significan't detail.  honestly all this book is - is an outline of their 16 day program.  They don't give any more details of the topics covered in the program, and this is just a summary of what they do.  But what are you paying this money for the book for - the brochure of the program tells you as much as this book does, and in fact when I checked out the program they told me more information just at my 30 minute meeting with them than they covered in this whole book.  The book was fairly worthless and not worth the money.  The ideas are good, but there's no information to back it up.   If you want more you have to enroll in their program.  The book is not worth the money.  I wish they would have done a better job and given the book more details, but then if they did that you wouldn't need to pay the big bucks to enroll in their program.  I feel pretty ripped off that I bought this book but the laundry list was actually helpful because I could then research each pain treatment so even though I don't think it's a great book - it actually helped me some.  
 I don't remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar.  If I have seen her elsewhere, it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than Gwen from 'Girl's Can't Swim', or I definitely would remember.  I'm still not sure what the title actually means... something about young women struggling to find their way... blah blah blah... but, it actually wasn't a terrible film.  Nevertheless, Le Besco's performance is one of the most irritating I've seen in years.  I was reminded of Dorothy Parker's cutting remark when critiquing a Katherine Hepburn film: 'She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.'   Le Besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face, or she was smacking her friends or family in a 'hissy fit of rage'.  These tantrums always ended with Gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three-legged moose.  What made LeBesco's performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else's performances were nearly flawless. This film was recommended to me after purchasing 'L'Effrontee', a truly marvelous picture.  While watching the first 30 minutes of 'Girl's Can't Swim' I could see that I was not the only person who admired 'L'Effontee's' subtle brilliance.  Obviously the director and/or screenwriter of 'Girl's Cant' Swim' intended on building upon the other film's message, but as a lark, they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity. I give the film 2 out of 5 because, despite its flaws, it is still superior to the vast majority of 'toejam' that hollywood produces each year 
 This is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass. Oh, and I don't sit in my room on Saturdays playing card games, either. But having fun doesn't mean "get drunk 24/7 for four years". There's something called HAVING A LIFE that this book totally misses but, well, it's for college kids, and they're mostly idiots 
 Whether you agree or not with Revel's views, and in large part I think I could be persuaded (by a more reasoned argument), his presentation carries the whiff of desperation that accompanies all ideologues and partisan hacks.  This book is no doubt very popular with people who already share its worldview. I came across it looking for a reasoned and reasonable presentation of viewpoints not necessarily my own. What I found instead was a book full of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw men, and the worst of the rhetorical games that can be played.  If you want a cheerleader to get you pumping your fist in the air a la Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken or Michael Moore or Bill O'Reilly, then this book will be great for your enthusiasm, if not necessarily for your intellect.  If you're looking for a thoughtful exploration of the nature of America, her standing in the world, and the reflexivity of that relationship, look elsewhere. If you find it, please let me know, I'm still looking 
 'Ibsen and Hitler' is just the latest in a series of sensationalistic Hitler 'exposes', right up there with 'Hitler's Flying Saucers' and 'Hitler's Antarctic Hideout'.  The question is: would the Third Reich and its crimes have taken place without Ibsen?  The answer is absolutely yes.  Unless the author can also prove, I suppose, that the hundreds of thousands of cronies who did their part for the holocaust- down to the truck drivers who shipped zyklon B and engineers who designed the ovens- also read and plagiarized from Ibsen, his findings serve only to titilate rather than shed any serious light on the workings and motives of the Nazi murder machine 
 I haven't read this thing, nor would I care to.  However, it has nonetheless had a profound (negative) influence in my life.  It seems that someone was "inspired" by this thing to make bizarre advances on someone I know.  Normally, I wouldn't care, but this person ended up suspecting me of doing it! Having glanced over the opening lines of this nauseating garbage, I'm highly offended that anyone would think I would read it, let alone act like an idiot because of it. What has become apparent to me is that readers of this sort of new age drivel are highly imbalanced and confused individuals, and potentially dangerous! I urge anyone of sound mind to avoid this book like the plague, and be wary of anyone who reads this sort of thing 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 I love Gary Null's radio program. It's so inspirational that I bought this book hoping for more of the same. Sadly, I found it one of the worst organized books I ever seen, badly edited, and full of pages and pages of superfluous "testimonials" (literally over fifty pages of insubstantial fan letters!) I'm sorry to write this because I am a fan of Gary's and appreciate what he does on the radio but I feel compelled to warn the prospective buyer away from this book 
 I don't understand why there is still a debate over whether or not DID/MPD exists.  It does.  And the experts/professionals have concluded so since they included in the DSM and since insurance companies fork over the money to treat it.  Since I have been diagnosed with it I was curious to hear what people have to say about why they think it doesn't exist.  That's why I was considering this book, but after reading the reviews I decided against it.  Here's why:  If you're going write a book debunking a legitimate diagnosis that is included in the current DSM, you should at least back it up with more than emotional backlash.  With the current findings from research (and from those who treat dissociative disorders) it is believed that DID/MPD CANNOT be realistically faked today.  Those who are trained in treating it can not only recognize when it is faked, but prove when it exists by doing some kind of special MRI (I'm not a dr. so I don't know what it's called).  Anyway, the condition exists.  I wouldn't recommend reading any book debunking it unless they can back it up with more convincing evidence than what is shown for it's existance (which you won't find btw) 
 This little book appeared to be very clever and well illustrated, however the quality, colors and illustrations were not what I had expected 
 I was interested in this book for 2 reasons: to understand what worked and to see the rantings and ravings of a madman. I purchased this book similar to the way people slow down to see car accidents on the side of the freeway. Mostly, I found the book the same way German found it when it was initially published - long winded and boring comservative rethoric. Before putting the book down, I made the distinction that if Hitler were a plitician in modern America, he would definately be one of the staunch Republicans who are afraid of science, social progress and their own shadows. On a positive note, the book further reveals the idiocy of his following as it reads a bit like the book of Mormon...not interesting.  
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 I found that this was a complete waste of time!  I consider myself a very  spiritual person but this was so vague that I kept waiting for the  "meat and potatoes" so to speak.  I have a family member who is a  severe alcoholic and I found nothing in this concept that I could use to  try to help the situation.  Don't waste your money 
 Although this critique might be viewed by my professors as academic suicide, I shall plunge headfirst and hope that the branches of tolerance break my fall.  I do not like A Room of Ones Own.  I understand the concept of stylized writing, but the content of the book does nothing to draw in the reader.  Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties.  There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas.  The presentation of these ideas; however, are uninteresting and handled in a very preachy manner.  It is my opinion that such revolutionary ideas should have been shot forth from a canon rather than whispered in a librar 
 I read the amazon reader reviews before I bought the book. Yet I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the purchase. The principles in the book about dream making is nothing new at all. The book tries to relate a  concept of 'ease' with a life working towards your dream. But it is not  very convincing to me. And the 5-step process on finding your dream is a  typical method that can be found in many other self-help books 
 This actually could have been a very watchable movie; Anthony Hopkins would be excellent anytime.  Micky Rourke is better than usual.  Mimi rogers is great.  two things make it not so good.  Comparing this to the original; there just isn't a comparison.  & Lindsay Crouse...oh man, she's painful in this one.  she has a very, I mean very, bad southern accent & it ruins the film 
 "Journey of the sparrows" was alright.  It relates to my  ancestors life.  At the begining I was really into it then around chapter 8  or 9 it got very boring.  The escaping from Mexico in a  crait and hieding  in the streets was intersting. Then When that lady took them a little  intencity was taken away.  Then when she got the job and was being harrased  I got more interesed again.  Fran Leeper writing style is great.  She makes  you feel like part of the book 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 As a life-long nudist, I was very disappointed with the DVD compared with the theatrical release that I saw in the mid 1980s. The theatrical release opened with many shots of the nude beaches, and continued this theme quite simply and unashamedly throughout the whole movie. Many nude beach scenes have been deleted altogether from the DVD and the few remaining scenes are cut drastically, in my view detracting badly from the spirit and freedom of the Greek islands at the time portrayed in the original movie 
 What a shame that a better work has not "followed" in the footsteps of Highsmith's first three Ripley novels. While the setup is intriguing and has great potential, the entire premise is marred by poor pacing; do we really need to have page after page of (what amounts to) a Berlin travelogue, as Tom Ripley and Frank visit the zoo...and then have a light lunch....and then go for a drive...and then take a walk in the forest. The kidnapping is the most engaging section of the novel - what a pity that it takes nearly half the book to even reach it. Though some may find Frank Pierson an interesting character, I was soon disappointed to see that he was reduced to a maudlin mass of ennui. There is nothing exciting or dramatic (or even interesting, for that matter) in a character who essentially "mopes" his way through the entire novel, brooding on the boorish notion that his girlfriend has gone off with another boy because he has travelled to France. Of all the Ripley books, this was the one I had the highest hopes for, and I was sorely disappointed; read it if you intend on reading all of them, but know that it's a flawed work at best 
 I read this a few years back, but I still remember it well for being the first book I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read about 100 pages, which took me over a month, after which I sat down and pondered whether the plot or characters actually justified going on reading. The book had its moments, but I found it to lack direction.  The language is absolutely excruciating. Some sentences are almost a page long, and just littered with commas, parentheses, strange use of colons, or all of the above. Often a sentence could begin with a story of something, then trailing off to a sub-story of that item, then trailing off to a sub-sub-story of the sub-story before going back to the sub-story, maybe to another sub-sub-story and back to the sub-story, and finally back again to the story where the sentence started. When you constantly have to go back half a page to remind yourself how the damn sentence STARTED, it's more frustrating than fun to read. I suppose Faulkner was going for some stream-of-consciousness approach, which I can safely say is not my cup of Scotch.  I should point out that I am an experienced reader and that I read it in my native tongue. Maybe the translator did a hack job, I have no idea. I only know it was a thoroughly painful read and I felt relieved to ditch it and move on. A book is NOT well written just because it's "difficult".  Of course, he won the Nobel prize, so what do I know 
 Being an avid Hollywood historian, I was eager to get this book about the history of Hollywood.  While the writing is fast paced, and the author has a keen interest in history, I cannot stop finding mistakes that make me question the writer's committment to research:  Fatty Arbuckle, for instance, was involved in a scandal at the St. Francis Hotel, not the Palace Hotel in San Francisco as reported here (and EVERY biography of Arbuckle mentions the St. Francis).  The Alhambra (in the Valentino part) is in Granada, not Seville, Spain.  Most historians believe William Desmond Taylor was gay, not "romancing both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Mintner at the same time".  Not to mention numerous typos that any self-respecting editor would have caught.  This turns me off 
 What so many other reviewers are saying about the slavish similarities to--and sometimes outright copying of--Lord of the Rings are right on the mark. True, Brooks dresses his world up differently, and adds few original touches (some of which aren't bad), but in the end this story simply fails to deliver anything new or even anything worth the time it takes to get through the 700+ pages of poorly-wrought prose. As John Gardner once said, it takes an authentic junk mind to write junk fiction, and the poor quality of the sequel bears testimony that Brooks doesn't improve a great deal after his debut novel.  It's a pity, really, because Brooks's conceit of placing his fantastic tales in the far future might have provided a counterpoint to Tolkien's placing his own stories in the distant past. The races of man Brooks invents (apparently "human" is different than "man") have some potential, but they just slip into the silliest stereotypes as soon as they appear on the page. The world his characters inhabit looks large on the map, but apparently it can be traversed without any great difficulty on foot in less than a week. I got the sense that Brooks is the kind of person with a lot of ideas but without the tools to make them work. J.K. Rowling does a much better job juggling her multitudinous creations.  As mentioned earlier, I did go on to read the sequel, "The Elfstones of Shannara," based on the insistence that Brooks gets better as he goes. Maybe that's true 10-15 novels down the line, but "Elfstones" is even weaker than the first novel, probably because he made up the plot himself rather than stealing a better plot from a better writer. Don't bother with either one unless you have low standards and a lot of time to kill 
 This is the book to buy if you want to teach your kids history revision, compartmentalized thinking and keeping secrets about sex and nudity while in the company of adults is the thing to do. The author encourages the readers to practice "skyclad" rituals with their kids, claiming conventional morality is nothing more than Christian guilt and shame about the body. While she does say skycladding may not be for everyone, she encourages the reader to get their children comfortable to the idea of group nudity, including introducing their children to "candle baths" to get them used to the idea. The author also recounts of how when her son was 10 or 11 he became offended by the dirty jokes and sex comments the adult Neopagans made at the gatherings. Rather than complement her son for his maturity, she instead blamed it on not being around other skyclad Wiccans, and thus his view was not "balanced". The author warns readers about places where the "anti-Witch sentiment is quite strong" and might call protective services on Wiccans who get naked with kids! There was quite a bit of emphasis in the book about how to help children deal with adult nudity and secrecy, and it's not hard to realize this is sending a dangerous message. The Burning Times (which didn't involve Wiccans since Wicca didn't exist until the 1950's) is also not a source of contention in the book.  While the author admits that no Wiccans were actually killed during the so-called "Burning Times" that European Paganism was quite extinct by the time of the Inquisition, she then turns around and says that the "Burning Times" should still be kept part of Wiccan "lore". This is because for these types, Wicca is no fun if you can't be part of a "Wiccan Holocaust" that never actually happened. They need the so-called "Burning Times" myth so they can have an excuse to hate Christians. Too mnay people get into Wicca simply because they don't like Christians, and that's just not a good reason to join. No one should ever join a religion to rebel against another religion. This book does nothing to stop it. By the same token, these people never mention the thousands of Christians murdered by Pagans during the era of the Persecuted Church. This is known as history revision, and nothing good can come out of it. On page 179, the book says if a Wiccan children ask their parents why some people confuse Wiccans with Satanists and why can't they talk about Wicca, the following explanation should be given;" Once upon a time, when Christian armies were expanding their empires, they found that their native Pagan people didn't want to be concurred. The only way to replace Pagan religions with Christianity was to lie about Paganism and kill the Pagans who resisted. There are fewer swords drawn against us these days, but the people believe the same lies. People won't believe the lies forever, but not everyone is willing to hear the truth yet." Not everyone is willing to accept the truth yet indeed! Clearly a case of the pot calling the cauldron black! The author has contradicted herself, saying there is no connection between Wicca and the so-called "Burning Times" and then turns right around and says there is...and then recommends using it to frighten children into being scared of Christians! Spreading fear and prejudice through lies is not a healthy way to raise kids. Most people (including Christians) know there's a difference between Wicca and Satanism, anyway. This compartmentalized thinking unfortunately represents the exact way many Wiccans think...that Wicca is a modern invention and yet a Stone Age religion. It can't be both. In conclusion, the book is worthless. 
 This book is a waste of money.  The best hitters are determined by a nonsensical formula which just adds unrelated statistics up.  Then each player gets a short biography and a picture or two.  It's neither a coffee table book nor a book to read, so I can't imagine anyone who would be satisfied with this volume 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.    My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.    Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)  The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.          [A `Thought You Should Know' review 
 Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice 
 I have the 2.4 ghz 4000 version and I love it, but it does buzz sometimes because of my home wireless network, so I thought I'd try the 5.8ghz. What a surprise to find it isn't as good. Yes it has some nice features that do work, but over all, it way over priced and flawed. 1. it's really hard to get a call off hold once you place them on hold. I never did figure out how to do that. 2. it's really difficult to call in to get your messages, knowing what to push, waiting to be told and you better have a lot of patience if you push a wrong button. 3. it's supposed to page you when a caller leaves a message. My 4000 pages me with the caller id of the person who left the messages, from the main unit. The hand sets page me with the number of the handset so I know which one the message is on. The new 4500 pages you with a blank page. You don't even have a way of knowing for sure that it was your phone system that did page you. It dials your pager, then nothing, so I get paged with a blank page, as if someone called my pager and didn't leave a message, or my cell phone with number held. 4. the pause key doesn't work in the paging portion of the phone, so you can enter a number and a pause to wait before continuing to enter numbers. 5. The worst part of the phone system is Panasonic, I'm sorry to say. I buy a lot of Panasonic products, but I won't be so much in a hurry to buy this name brand. They do not answer emails, I spent hours on the phone only to have the "techs" read to me from the manual that I have... they don't know the phone. No one bothers to ask or look into anything and after they read to you from the manual, they hang up on you, so you have to start over. I took it back and I went back to using my 4000, which is many years old (5 or 6). When I finally did get responses from Panasonic, via email, I was told that "that feature doesn't work, that feature doesn't work, that feature doesn't work" and "if that feature doesn't work, return for replacement". I had to go back to my email to see the order in which the questions were being answered; very impersonal 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 Opera is intended to be seen - a true multi-media art. But a fascinatingly perfect stage setting aside, this is one production better heard than seen. Sonically, the performances please, but this rates as one of the more visually disturbing casts I have witnessed. A 58-year-old Plcido Domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier. Aprile Millo, as a well-fed version of the Ethiopian slave girl (in ridiculous black face), Aida, defies the costumers' best attempts to provide a waist line. And Dolora Zaijick mirrors a middle-aged matron more than the Egyptian princess Amneris. A fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities. Like an emperor, the Metropolitan Opera stands as a respected authority. Perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act, but the emperor has no clothes - or at least they need ironing.  These are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera. Huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased, but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate 
 I love Massive Attack. I hate, with a passion, 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. Come on! Poor Horace Andy sounds like he's hurling in that song! I'm really trying to like this compilation. Some songs are wonderful (Dido, Gorillaz, Morcheeba, Royksopp, Badly Drawn Boy, Chem. Bros.), but then they want to include Goldfrapp's 'Utopia', which is a brilliant song, but the track included in the Ultra compilation is some [bad] mix that doesn't even begin to portray the beauty that is the original uncut song. WTF?! I feel lightly ripped-off, like I've been had. So, I'm going to edit my copy of Ultra Chilled Vol. 1 and burn my own edit (and include the original 'Utopia') so I can at least enjoy the good parts. But seriously, it shouldn't have to be like this 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink" excepted).  Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island.  The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course.  Yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for 
 Well, i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking.  First it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto, then it just stopped working.  It was pretty cool for a bit, and is pretty light and easy to set up, but I'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol 
 This book is perpetuating false facts about Reiki and its history. Hayashi did not charge $10,000 for master level training as this book claims. And certainly Usui did not charge anywhere near $10,000 as the book is  suggesting. This book also states that Usui was a Christian monk, when in  fact he was Buddhist. Another false fact presented in this book is that  Hayashi was Usui's successor, when we know through research it was Ushida.  The society that Usui founded in 1922 still exists today in Japan and is  called Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho. Ushida was the second president of this  organization after Usui made his transition. I recommend the book Reiki  Fire for those interested in the true and verifiable history of Reiki or  contact the Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho society in Japan. These are only a FEW  examples of the incorrect information this book is presenting about Reiki  and its history 
 I will never buy a brand new product release from Linksys again. Their Q.C. stinks. I am on the third WRT54GX4 router and it is the first that was not defective. I got it set up and tried my new WPC54GX4 network card(SRX400) and got a weak signal, but I had my second laptop with a WPC54GX card(SRX200) on the desk getting 100% signal strength. I switched cards in the two computers, and the old SRX200 card was better in either computer(both XP Pro). After hours with semi-English speaking techs, they came to the same conclusion I came to in five minutes...a bad antenna in the new WPC54GX4. So once again Amazon will replace a defective Linksys product for me. I had been a Linksys fan in the past, but not any more. Here's a link to a picture of the first router I got and its defect.  http://vowe.net/archives/006639.htm

 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 "Wise Blood" could more aptly be called "Stupid Minds."  Both titles are tendentious, but the latter is more accurate.  Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania.  We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic.  Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.   Faulkner plumbed the humanity within or beneath the grotesque.  Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.  Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar.  If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, an Islamic terrorist would be wise 
 When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item 
 I am trying to be an amateur investor and this book didn't help. I was hoping for clear formulas for valuing companies, assessing risk vs. reward etc.  The most valuable part of the book is when the author describes his own transaction as a manager, but he makes huge leaps over how he reaches his conclusions.  I guess I needed someone to say "take this and add it to that", etc., and this book didn't 
 I gave this book 2 stars more out of nostalgia then anything. It is chalk full of florally pros that border on the boring. I am not sure what came first the movie or the book however I found both of them to be severely lacking. The characters are hard to like especially Claire and by the end of the book I didn't much care if they got together or not 
 Mr. Chowdhury's writing is quite dry and I didn't get much out of reading this book.  I was quite disappointed after hearing so much from others

 does not live up to the hype, no wonder he works with Jakob Nielsen, same thinking "structures" erm. nice idea seeds, would fit into a four pager, even with examples.  don't buy this book, the seven bullet items summarize all included.  much awrite about nothing 
 I bought this thinking that it would work better than scooping kitty litter into a small trash bag and tying it off and then placing it in the trash.  I was WRONG.  This does not hold much waste and takes up un-necessary space.  If you want to buy something for your soiled kitty litter get a diaper genie and throw your trash bags of waste in that.  I have three cats and have to empty this Litter keeper at least every other day.  I wish I never bought it

 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 This book should be renamed "1001 Stories About People Who Took Initiative at Work". There was very little actual advice to guide the reader on how to take initiative at work. Almost the entire book was composed of short anecdotes about others who did something special on the job. I found these stories to be somewhat interesting for the first 50 pages or so, but tired of them quickly. If you're looking for inspiration on how to increase your performance at work, I'd recommend looking elsewhere 
 Though I found this book full of facts and a great look into their lives, the Author is very repetitive in his writing.  He repeats himself to the point of annoyance.  There are paragraphs that are rewritten two to three times in a few chapters.  If you can get past this, check it out.  If it irritates you like it does me, find another title about them 
 Why not sell the thing with a battery, it's a special battery, not available in the boonies, so I have a choice....Drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail.  Iknow, Iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that?  So for the folks who read this... BUY A BATTERY TOO!!! 
 I really think these cards were a rip off.   The drawing of the baby in the cards is enormous so its really difficult for the child to see what word he or she is supposed to recognize or sign.   Big waste of money 
 I have wanted to see this movie since it came out in 1981 when I was first becoming interested in 60s radicalism (I was 10 at the time) and now I really wish that I had seen it then and got that particular mania out of my system.  Despite great acting by actors that had yet to be established (ironically Kevin Kline's future wife, Phoebe Cates, would be in Fast Times at Ridgement High - that other movie with a cast of well known actors that the casting director somehow managed to find before they were famous) the overall script is just a tedious mess of characters acting badly. They are either guilty about selling out or they are trying to live the pissed off radical stereotype (one that wears very thin after your 20th birthday) and Meg Tilly is just there to say some of the funniest strange lines (it's like she was auditioning for the part of River on Firefly 20 years too early). I won't deny that it's cool seeing Jeff Goldblum playing creepy and Kevin Kline fighting it otu with Jeff Daniels, but the storyline feels dated.   Last, the special features are pretty weak. The trailer is badly done. The "making of" featurette has Lawrence Kasdan saying the exact same things he says on the liner notes. And the extra scenes don't even show the Kevin Costner scenes that they filmed and edited out (which is a shame since everyone goes on about how his character was the bright spot and the center of the group, but we never get the sense that he's anything but a corpse. Of course, halfway through the movie I started to wish that Kasdan would have just done a movie abotu the Costner character with his friends as minor players - but then again when Kasdan and Costner did team up they produced the painfully dull Wyatt Earp.)  So this is an OK movie, but it's not great. It doesn't deserve the respect it gets. I'm sure there are better movies abotu college friends reuniting and/or The 60s. There have to be. Anyhow, watch it if you have the burning desire but don't pay full price 
 I am now at page 590 in a 720 page book.  Absolutely nothing of relevance has happened.  Similar to the 2nd book, I'm guessing the last 50 pages will be a crazy and implausible 'wrap up'.  Instead of focusing on how verity regains his throne, how they thwart the red ships or how they dispose of regal, the only thing that happens is we get to read about how fitz travels literally from buck to past the mountains.  Nothing really happens along the way either.  Fitz travels on a road little more than a trail, he gets tired, goes to sleep, starts skilling toward molly and burrich although he doesn't want to and then wakes up again to drink some elfbark tea.  Rinse and repeat for 600 pages, literally.  I see no adequate way for Hobb to 'finish' up this book in the next 130 pages considering her rambling writing style.  I find myself thinking "oh no he's going to sleep again" and shaking my head almost every other chapter. Fitz gets captured like three times and three times he 'manages' to escape.  I felt like i was watching an episode of the original Batman on television!  It's amazing how one can write 600 pages and have nothing happen at all.  I understand character development but this is beyond reasonable when it's 99% that and 1% story/plot.  I also found myself thinking aloud "i don't want to read this anymore" many times throughout the meanderings in this book.  I'm not exaggerating, nothing happens in the 600 pages I've read.    Not to mention the number of plot holes I've encountered.  It's baffling. I really regret reading this series.  For example, Molly encounters old men who recognize her as the bastard's woman, yet Regal can still not find her!  Okay!     It started off decent with the first book.  It was a good intro and I was excited to start the 2nd book.  After 500 pages in that book with nothing happening, i started to get an idea of about the 3rd.  But by then it was too late to stop reading the series.  Hobb's writing style is at times rather annoying too.  Whenever the characters ask a question with a negative particle, she insists on switching the subject with the negative ala "Can not you.." or "Should not you.."  Then she switches back to regular American dialogue.  She isnt' consistent with it either.  It's awkward at best.  Each and every single female character has to be sassy and always try to take charge.  God forbid she portrays a female that's not 'equal' to men or appears weak!  Her villains are laughable.    We know nothing of more of the red ships or Regal, or the forged ones by 500 pages into the third book than we did 50 pages into book one.  It's astounding how she can concentrate so much on Fitz, who never really grows anyway, and leave all the other characters to a single dimensional fate.  Regal is the embodiment of evil and that's good enough for you!  I really want to stop reading this book even now at 600 pages into it because I know the ending is going to be terrible, yet I am compelled to finish it because I've invested so much time into it...  Read this book at your own risk 
 There are many Reba albums that are masterpieces as far as I'm concerned.  Some of these are :  "Whoevers In New England", "What Am I Gonna Do About You", "Heart to Heart" and "Unlimited" and "For My Broken Heart".  To qualify an album for "masterpiece status" ALL THE SONGS on it have to be single material.  The problem with this Cd is that there are many brilliant songs on here that should have been released as singles but weren't.  The rest of the songs are throwaways.  The title track is a total loser...a rock and roll type of song that with a terrible melody.  The keepers are "I'll Be", "I'm Not Your Girl", "Roses", "She Wasn't Good Enough For Him" and "Back Before the War".  THe outstanding cut is her duet at the end with Jose and Durval the Brazilian guys who sound great with Reba.  Reba should be very proud of the way this song turned out.  It alone makes the album worthwhile.  THe other songs "What do You Say", "When You're Not Trying To", "Nobody Dies From a Broken Heart" and ther rest are all forgettable!!  It makes me sad because this had the potential to be a true masterpiece if Reba had only picked out songs like the "good ones" I mentioned above.  The good ones are all excellent "single potential" songs and excellent in every way!!  
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I have read and enjoyed all the volumes involving the "No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."  This was a book I eagerly anticipated, but found very disappointing.  The stories seem to be simply retellings of very simple, but ambiguous, themes.  It didn't have anything which stuck with me (except a quizzical expression on my face, I guess). 
 I had a lot of high hopes for this book.  Sirona Knight has obvious experience with magic, and talent with the pen.  Dream Magic starts out weakly, yet another book that feels the need to defend itself in the first few chapters.  (The usual, and far too often repeated magic isn't Satanism, Some Christians aren't that understanding...blah blah blah.)  Then I started to really enjoy myself while working through her versions of quarter calling, circle castings, and astral meditations.  However, I expected her to go into more advanced studies...or further details and she never did.  The start of what could be an awesome book drops off into a number of love and wealth spells.  What a let down 
 Whether or not you like this collection of essays will depend on your definition of travel writing. D.Cooper's "Canadian Gothic", J.McPhee's "A Fleet of One" and B.Donahue's "Under the Sheltering Sky" are all excellent. However many of the pieces chosen are little more than self-indulgent fluff. Was 2004 such a mediocre year for travel writing? M.Byers "Monuments to Our Better Nature" and R.Chevat's incoherent "Screenwriters Vacation" and M.Gorra's "Innocents Abroad?" are hardly memorable.  As another review has pointed out the selections seem to come from a rather limited field: The New Yorker, National Geographic, Travel&Leisure. There are thousands of publication venues, yet Pico Iyer decided to treat us  to an anthology that is  top heavy with selections from the  main stream "Big Media" press. The publisher of this series, Houghton-Mifflin hasn't strayed far from the ground that it feels most comfortable with-established main stream authors. Even the piece by Tim Cahill does not represent his best writing. Most of the selections in this book seem like warmed-up left-overs.  As another reviewer has  mentioned,  only 4 of the 24 selected authors are women writers. This just boggles the mind... were there no women writers of merit in 2004?  My main concern is that few of these selections are really "travel stories". Some are set in foreign locales, but deal with subjects like teaching English in Tanzania, riding the bus in NYC,  famine in Ethiopia ,and  political repression in Burma. There is also an irritating post-9/11 angst in several of the essays. While this maybe a  reflection of the mood of  American writers in 2004  coming to grips with their new found feeling of insecurity in their comfortable middle-class lives, it does not reflect the daily  pre-occupations of the other 5 billion souls on the planet. There is a self-centered navel gazing in this collection of essays that reflects some of the worst, not the  best of recent travel writing.  Nowhere in this collection will you find the brilliant writing of  W. Thesinger, Freya Stark, Norman Lewis, Eric Hansen,  or Jan Morris. You will find a lot of boring and recondite references to Henry James  however.  This collection of essays is to travel writing what Starbucks is to a bistro . If you can't tell the difference from the real thing, you might enjoy it. Maybe.   I would give this book a big miss, and send a message to Houghton-Mifflin . Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to the "old Europe". This collection of essays isn't even "old-style travel writing". It is a mis-directed bore, brought to you from the same corporate folks that convinced you that chicken McNuggets is  really food. This isn't travel literature. It isn't even literature. Most of the collection is dross. 
 Beware -- this is not the update to the highly regarded Kingfisher Illustrated History. Instead, it reformats the previous work, departing from the orderly 'accent of western civilization' theme, de-emhasizing Greek and Roman history in favour of lesser known, minor world cultures and in general, adds aggresive PC editing. Using this book as a homeschool reference will result in you needing to spend time explaining the PC biases to your children, and ultimately, needing to purchase an additional reference book 
 This book has some good information, but is very incomplete.  It does not even contain the deora car that is on the front cover and title page of the book!!!  This book only lists mint in package prices and many cars have been left out.  It also contains very little variations.  If you are looking for a complete price guide, look somewhere else 
 I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are 1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences 2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much). 3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.  Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10 
 There is so much scientific nonsense in the book that it is appalling! Working in the field of self-organized behavior in insects colonies, I can tell you that the presentation of that subject in the book is awful!  The number of wrong statement is so outrageously large that they are impossible to list below 10 pages of text!! It is a pity because such a book completely discredits a real scientific field that is confronted enough with new-age babble, scientific unfounded or wrong statements, pseudo-philosophical stupidities and so on. If you want to learn something real about "emergence" please stay away from this book. The rating of 1 star is just for the paper on which the book is written.. 
 I think Dr Oz is a fantastic doctor and I have heard him speak on tv but I did not find any useful information in this book for my life 
 This book had such great reviews so I decided to try it. What I found was a slow story.  I just didn't care about the characters and I struggled to get through the first 100 pages.  The writing was good, but it did not draw me into the story 
 "European vocabularies do not have a silence rich enough to describe the force within Indian contemplation. Only Shakespeare understood that Indians have eyes." (p. 23) And how would Mr. Rodriquez know anything about the force of Indian contemplation? He doesn't allow Americans, among whom he numbers himself, to know much of anything. And what's this about Shakespeare? Didn't he just say something about European vocabularies?  Informed by his immersion in Elizabethan English, Rodriguez fashions poetry out of absurdity, misanthropy and breathtaking contradiction. He fools high school kids (and it seems a lot have been assigned this book), but the educated, well read adult will be skeptical. How can he complain that he was taught that the Indians were gone, then drag multicultural education through the mud? I'm ANGRY that U.S. history was fed to me divorced from North America. I thought Montezuma was a legend! I defend all efforts at inclusion even when some ridiculous stuff comes along with it. Keep those ideas coming!  And why is it that the people who have benefited most from affirmative action spit in its face? It's especially odd coming from a man whose parents moved to the U.S. for the express purpose of bettering their children.  Rodriguez is entertaining on the topic of alienation, but he's the perfect example of why I've yearned for a minority gripe: It gives the human soul a hook on which to hang the cloak all mortals wear, the weight of an elegiac separation from God and other people. It's not about being Mexican/American, it's about the human condition: Read the poetry of the precortesian Mexican philosopher Nezahualcoyotl, who, as King of Texcoco, was hardly a stranger in a strange land.  Warning to readers: Rodriguez saves all his personal attacks for women. If you find man-hating literature tiresome, which I do, beware misogyny from a man who waxes lyrical about bedpans.   Rodriguez strives valiantly to be Octavio Paz, and is even trotted out as our answer to Mexico's Nobel laureate. (See, we Americans can search our souls in inscrutable, contradictory ways, too!) My advice? READ OCTAVIO PAZ INSTEAD. At least he loved life 
 I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field 
 I love books about evil, deranged killers. Usually, I would say the more deranged, the better the story, but this book crosses the line. It is just too harsh, too wretchedly cruel for me. For a metally-ill villian to work well, he/she must have some human characteristics, even if miniscule. Michael O'Connell has none. He is incomprehensibly mean. His motivation seems to be that of a robot, programed to kill. And his ability to insinuate himself into his victims lives and mentally torture them is beyond believable. This story went beyond my comfort level, until I finally gave it up half way through. I like scary books; I don't like books that cross the line into gratuitous torture 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 Too long, too extraneous, too trying too hard, too boring, too pointless. It was torture trying to get through this. A waste of 430+ pages 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 Am I doomed to hate electronic music forever? At the present time, I can count on one hand the number of artists within it that I generally enjoy; far too small a number to sustain an interest in the genre. The problem, as I see it, is that, as a sympton of the genre's machine and synthesizer foundation, that most electronic artists are profoundly lazy. They simply let the sample and preset banks do the work for them, resulting in music that is repetitive, dull, and soulless.  Darude's "Before the Storm" is a prime example of exactly what I mean by the above paragraph. Finnish artist Ville Virtanen achieved some degree of fame with the single "Sandstorm" which actually achieved some mainstream radio airplay; you've probably heard it at least once even if you don't listen to (or actively avoid) electronic music. As a piece of music, it's purely disposable; poppy hooks, an anthemic chorus, and a simplistic and repetitive structure. Well, one single isn't enough for a full-length album, so Darude filled up an entire album (yes, a full-length LP) of "remixes" and thinly-veiled knockoffs of his smash hit.  I have scarcely encountered music more bereft of imagination and creativity. EVERY song follows the same formula: a stale, 4/4 beat with some irritating, buzzing synth samples and, if you're lucky, some irritating vocals (most noticeable on track 9 "The Flow"). EVERY song is dripping with cheesy, repetitive pop hooks and banal melodies. Like all bad electronic music, the songs go nowhere and show no progression throughout their length, despite the fact that some run on for seven minutes or more. Darude is even so lazy as to reuse the same synth samples as featured on "Sandstorm", giving the listener the impression that Darude simply cut, pasted, and rearranged "Sandstorm" to fill out a full-length album. "Feel the Beat", for example, could have easily been a simple remix of "Sandstorm".  Furthermore, I take umbrage at people labelling this music as "trance". Perhaps I'm flaunting my ignorance of electronic music here, but isn't trance music supposed to be, I don't know, entrancing? Because there is absolutely nothing "entrancing" about this album. It's shallow, cloying, repetitive, and predictable, riding the success of the overplayed single "Sandstorm". This isn't trance. This is the kind of banal, disposable pap that's done nothing but turn a promising genre into a cesspool of cheese. Look elsewhere 
 I love goth, rock, punk and reggae music but this is a load of wannabe rockers trying to be cool and failing quite miserably, i hope that this music doesn't get TO popular otherwise us Goths will have to release loads of albums to get this junk of the charts 
 The authors of this book are able to twist and distort facts to a point where it is unbelievable.  Are they worried of China becoming too strong?  The PLA is modernizing and they are afraid that it will "upset the  balance of power" in the area.  That's just a another way of saying  that they are challenging the U.S. sphere of influence.  They say China is  seeking hegemony when U.S. influence stretches from Yokohama all the way to  Jerusalem.  Now suddenly we're scared to death when China has the  capability to project its powers beyond its borders?  This book is a joke!   Look at the economic situation; they commment on the trade deficit.  Well,  at the same time the U.S. is placing huge trade embargoes on China.  How  can you criticize the trade deficit when your government is actually  preventing free trade?  Reading this book, one would actually believe that  China is going to WWIII; it is 200 pages of U.S. government propaganda that  just isn't worth your time 
 This book reads like stereo instructions!  In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions.  Many terms are used but not defined.  Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 I found the basic idea of this story as interesting and I was excited to read a story that dealt with racial equality, etc. However, I felt that the story was a little too far fetched and so many of the situations did not seem realistic or plausible at all. Also, during the short span of time that this story took place pretty much every character was having a pretty significant life revelation, discovery, exposure, etc. etc. I know the author was just trying to bring home the point of the book, but for me it was so extreme that it was not believable at all. There seemed to be many long dialogue passages between the different characters that said the same things over and over again.  I wasn't really excited about this book, and the characters just did not grab me. I did appreciate the main idea of racial equality and thought about the things the characters said. This is my first book by this author. 
 This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's  hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the  Decca/MCA "Greatest Hits" and "Ernest Tubb Story" were  pretty good...but this album is for completists only 
 I was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for Christmas, however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented.  Now I need to return them.  Other than the dent, they were cute. Even though they were only $25.00, there should be some quality control by the manufacturer 
 El producto es de muy bajas caracteristicas. Material barato, zoon de baja calidad, en otras palabras es sumamente inferior a otros equipos que he probado los cuales se encuentran en el mismo rango de precios. Kodak tiene una linea de Camaras económicas las cuales paracen ser desechables.  No lo recomiedo 
 I've read Arroyo's "Chart Interpretation Handbook", so I picked this one up while looking for information on the elements. Unfortunately, I didn't get much from this book. I was very disappointed to find the charts and the house explanations almost reprinted word-for-word from "Chart Interpretation." While I appreciate the information on the elements, I didn't really learn anything. I was also disappointed that the subject of archetypes was not clearly tied to the planets, signs and houses. The author does bring a lot together in this book, but it is very general, more of a grouping of what's been stated by others, than an actual point of reference. Perhaps as my astrological studies continue this book will become more meaningful to me. I've since found much more relevant information on the four elements elsewhere 
 Nothing much new or of substance here.  I sent it back and ate the postage 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 Rumpelstiltskin is a movie I recorded off of a paid channel years ago. I only recently sat down and rewatched it. This movie is from the same people that did Leprechaun, (no surprise there), since this movie is about a little deformed creature man.  The movie is about pregnant woman whose husband dies in the line of duty. Sometime has passed since his death and she's had the baby. Now she visits a pawn shop where she finds this unique looking jade and gold statue. She takes the statue home, and finds herself wishing her husband could see his baby. Well, Rumpelstiltskin "grants" her wish, and in return she must now give him her first child. He terrorizes her through the whole movie, and kills the people that gets in his way.  Watching the movie, I noticed there wasn't really any blood in it, and it wasn't all that scary. I found myself getting bored halfway through the movie. I must say that the make up effects on Rumpelstiltskin was pretty realistic looking and creepy. The movie seemed like more of an action movie with a deformed little man as the bad guy, instead of a horror movie.   It wasn't very original either, it reminded me too much of Leprechaun, with a little man terrorizing the characters of the movie untill he gets what he's after, and killing everyone that gets in his way. Same basic plot of Leprechaun, only worse with no blood. It wasn't the worse movie I've seen, but it wasn't all that great, and it didn't creep me out one bit for a horror movie.     
 This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally 
 Nancy Leigh Demoss does make many good points in this book, so I could not bring myself to give it only 1 star.  However, she is so lacking in empathy for women, so condescending, that I advise anyone considering reading _Lies Women Believe_ to save their time and money.  She cherry-picks scripture to back up her claims, such as divorce is *always* a sin, ignoring the direct words of our Lord and Savior in Matthew 19.  I say that if Jesus allows divorce for "immorality", then Nancy Leigh Demoss should not contradict him.  She gives trivial examples of reasons women divorce, like a husband forgetting a birthday....what about incest,abuse, adultery, alcoholism??  For the record, I am not divorced, but it makes me furious to hear Christian woman encouraged to stay in abusive situations because divorce is a "sin".  She has never been married and has no children and it shows!  She has no idea what is it like to raise children, to cope with closely spaced births, to cope with life with a husband, children, a job.  Most Christian woman I know have paying jobs, at least part-time, and it is a necessitity, not an indulgence.  I work so my family can continue to live indoors, not because I am a "raging feminist".  I could go on and on.....save your money 
 Buss must love to hear himself talk.  This is overstating the obvious to the n'th degree.  How many ways can you say that murder is related to human evolution and animalistic instincts?     There, actually, I just re-wrote the whole book in one sentence.  Don't bother...there's a reason there are so many of these for sale used, and very cheap 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 Bottom Line: Fans of A Series of Unfortunate Events will most likely be disappointed by this book.  "The End" does for series what the movie did for the franchise; and that's not good.  Before I get into the negatives, first let me state the positives.  While not as good as in earlier books, the writing in "The End" is clever and still has the trademark Snicket whit and wordplay, although the jokes seem forced and repetitive - but I guess it all depends on how you look at it.  Also, the final revelation in Chapter 14 (yes, there is an additional chapter at the end of the book) gives careful readers a lot to ponder.  As with all the other books in the series, this is a fun and fast read and, even though there are major problems, I must admit that I still had a good time reading this book.  That's about it for the positives.  Now for the downside.  First off, you will not find resolution to many of the series' mysteries in "The End": No information on the contents or location of the sugar bowl, nothing more about the purpose of VFD or its schism, nothing about the fates of the villains and volunteers from the fire at the Hotel Denouement (or the hidden library), not a word about the "man with a beard but no hair" and the "woman with hair but no beard," not a peep about the possible survival of one of the Baudelaire parents, etc, etc, etc.  The problem isn't that "The End" doesn't explicitly resolve these issues for us (did anyone actually expect that it would?), it's that the layers and layers of intrigue that have been building up for years are largely ignored.  The true unfortunate event would be if the series were to end like this, with nothing more to bring closure to these outstanding mysteries.  This volume does add an extensive cast of new characters, however they are all as flat as a pancake (read the book, then try telling one of your associates or enemies anything about the characters Marlow, Larsen, or almost any of the other islanders for that matter - bet you can't).  This time around even the series' mainstay, Count Olaf, seem utterly lifeless and even out of character.    The plot of this book is rather dull, which is perplexing considering that this is the longest book in the series. What you will find within the pages of this book are 12 chapters of fairly slow paced and repetitive "story," followed by a long Chapter 13 that is so utterly ridiculous that the writers of Scooby-Doo would feel guilty ending their story (let alone a beloved series) in such a way.  It is as if the author got to the end of the book and noticed he hadn't moved the ongoing story forward, so decided to have certain characters monologue about the fates of others.  For example, we have all been wondering what happened to the Quagmires and expecting some type of glorious reunion, but I'm quite sure that nobody wanted to hear Kit Snicket say "yeah, they captured some birds and then crashed into the ocean, where the 'question mark' shaped vessel swallowed them up.  I don't know if they're alive or not.  P.S. - Fiona and the Hook-Handed Man got swallowed too."  Lol!  As terrible as that sounds, the actual text in the book isn't much better than what I just wrote.  Not to spoil anything, but the bit about Count Olaf's fate isn't much better either.  The pacing is all wrong: why spend chapters going on about the tedium of island life, and then cram the important contents into a few scant sentences?  Judging by the response to this book, it looks like old Lemony has really dug himself a hole.  The fans are mad, and justly so.  Even if the series continues in spin-off books for years to come, many fans have been turned of by "The End" and just don't care anymore.  The prevailing attitude is that readers would be better off stopping with Book 12; in many ways it is better to use your imagination and think of the millions of possible ways that the series could have ended, rather than reading the thoroughly unfulfilling way that it did end.  All I can say is that if there are future books coming, they had better be something 'really' special, or "The End" may be the beginning of the end 
 Sorry guys, but after all the hype that was building up to the initial release of the Blue Lion Collection here, I am extremely disappointed about the final product here.    OK, first of all I was a big fan of this show back in '84 and '85....but that was when I was only like 10 or so.  So, weigh that in with what I have to say below.  So 20+ years later, even after restoration, the animation in this series just doesn't hold up.  From the crudely animated environment to the pencil like drawings of the lions and Voltron, to the terribly animated mouth movements, the animation is just horrible compared to the 3D enhanced animation we get today in modern animated shows like Justice League and other mainstream anime series.  Oh, one note about the restoration itself.  If this is restored, I'd hate to see what it was like prior to restoration.  It still looks pretty bad, IMO.    Another thing I find disturbing is the juvenile dialogue.  Very childish dialogue on top of very childish voice-overs.  I mean it's not even funny.  It's like the scrounged the bottom of the barrel to get these actors to voice this show.  I guess I'm just spoiled now that modern animated show get some top voice actors to give life to the characters.  I bought this collection with the intention of buying the whole set, but after struggling to get through the 15 episodes, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time or money on this badly aged series.  If I may say so myself, the packaging is the only redeeming feature of this set.  Shame the series itself isn't any better.   Now, if they were to ever release the 3D CGI animated version of Voltron, I'd buy that set in an instant.  That one was for a much mature audience.  Hopefully it'll see the light of day soon.  IIRC, it was only 26 episodes or so, so a 4 disc set would catch that one 
 First off, let me suggest instead "Reinventing Your Life: The Breakthough [sic Amazon] Program to End Negative Behavior" by Jeffrey E. Young as a vastly superior book for the recovering narcissist.  As a narcissist, I was advised to read this book by a therapist, to better understand the origins of my own narcissism. I was already aware that my parents were narcissists and I am looking for help in recovering from my own narcissism. This book does not provide actual help for a narcissist in terms of suggestions or advice, aside from indirectly suggesting you seek professional help. The trouble is very few therapists will in actuality want to deal with a narcissist. They will, however, be willing to suggest reading literature.   This book is a story about the author herself and a collection of other stories about others who are all linked by their having narcissistic parents. Reading about what sorts of problems other people have doesn't especially help you in recovery aside from pointing out areas to consider and perhaps bringing forth something from your past you may have buried and long since forgotten. That being the case, I rated it two stars instead of one as there could be some benefit from reading it. I cannot say whether it would be beneficial for someone who was unaware of their own narcissism or their parent's narcissism, though I would question how they happened to pick up the book in the first place.   I would suggest reading instead about schema therapy (i.e. the book mentioned at the start of this review) which actually offers steps to proceed through which are enlightening and appear to be significantly helpful 
 Yes, I am way, way over thirteen and a big Christina Aguilera fan. I can't help myself.  I actually rate this item a minus 6 stars but that option was not available.  This DVD is a joke - a bad joke. Spend your money on ANYTHING else. 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 It's always discouraging when self-professed Christians lie, and Dembski purposefully perpetuates a lie in order to further his ID claims.  The lie is that evolution by natural selection is "random."  Most famous is the analogy of a hurricane sweeping through a junkyard and creating a jumbo jet.  That's so ridiculously impossible that evolution must be impossible, too.  Right?  But only the genetic mutations underlying evolution are random.  And being random, most of them are in fact terrible failures, frequently causing the fetus carrying them to spontaneously abort.    Only those mutations that do not harm the carrier can be passed on to future generations.  That is a non-random selection process.  In general, only those mutations that actively benefit the carrier are likely to spread throughout the population.  That is a non-random selection process, too. (That's a bit simplified, but the general point holds--even harmful mutations that spread do so non-randomly.)  Dembski's claim that all non-randomness is evidence of design fails the simplest test of logic.  So his goal of mathematically proving design by finding complexity is a red herring.  His implicit claim that evolution by natural selection is randomness in action is a flat-out lie.    Don't be fooled by the ID claims of scientific oppression.  Dembski's work is unscientific not because he believes in God (many scientists believe in God and get published), but because it tries to prove the unprovable.  Karl Popper pointed out decades ago that you can't prove a negative.  Evolutionary biologists don't claim they have proven the non-existence of God because they understand Popper's principle.  But Dembski believes he can prove that evolution didn't cause something--he never actually tries to prove God, he only tries to prove something else didn't happen, then sticks God in place as the only explanation.  That is bad logic, bad science, and even bad theology 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 I have uninstalled SystemWorks 2006 and will not be going back to Symantec products. I had three problems:  1. On initial install of SystemWorks in January 2006, the "GoBack" module wiped my hard drive. This was annoying and not easy to fix.  2. I reinstalled (and had to reregister) without the GoBack module and used the software for several months satisfactorily. A few annoyances: CleanUp consistently (every night) deleted cookies and autofills I wanted to keep, so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table, they kept disappearing.  3. I wanted to move to a faster hard drive. After following the Norton Ghost directions explicitly (and getting a "successful" message, the cloned drive would not boot up. I therefore went back to my old drive. SystemWorks required me to reinstall (and reregister). In December, after renewing my SystemWorks subscription for $49.95, I successfully cloned the disk (using EZ Gig II). Again, the only software that did not work on boot up was SystemWorks. I called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers. I explained the circumstances but was told "there was nothing to be done," and that I would have to buy the software again. I chose not to.  I have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from Word, Photoshop, etc. The protections I was getting from SystemWorks are being covered by AVG AntiVirus (shareware), Registry Mechanic (shareware), SpyBot (shareware), and DiskKeeper ($30), and Microsoft's Malware Guard (free).  I have been using Norton/Symantec products for over 15 years. Never again 
 I REALLY HATE THAT I ORDERED THIS BOOK.  IT IS LOUSY.  IT DOES NOT HAVE GOOD RECIPES OR RECIPES THAT PEOPLE WOULD REALLY ENJOY.  THEY ARE TOO STRANGE.  I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS BOOK AND I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE TO PURCHASE IT 
 Welcome to a new style of reviews.  For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring.  Today marks a day of change.  I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing.  Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans - but for me, it is still all about the cinema.    War, really people, what is it good for?  Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film "Hart's War", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his "luxury" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.   Did I hint towards "The Great Escape" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes "Hart's War" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, "You can't handle the truth", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.  How bland.    "Hart's War" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?    Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, "oh brother!".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.    This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved "Fallen" so very much.  "Hart's War" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.        So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?  To my reply ... absolutely nothing.    I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give "Hart's War" a  (wait for it ...)  BLAH 
 Too much of personal letters not much variety of bussiness letters. Very simple choice of words. I could'nt use it at al 
 this book is full of cliches and is very outdated. the stuff he talks about does not relate to real estate anymore. he recommends you don't farm?!!?!?!?!?! i really can't stand the writing style and how choppy it is. also, the print is really small and hard to read, and i have 20/20 vision 
 To borrow a riff from PJ, if this is literature, I'd hate to see what drivel looks like... I've always enjoyed PJ's hilarious rants as he skewered stupidity and political correctness, while keeping his political beliefs (for the most part) under the hood, where they rightly belonged.  Sadly, in this case, the dual curse of flat humor laced with bitterness and the burden of a lost political cause (the defense of Dubya) combine to transform this from "must buy" to "pick it up when you please because it will languish on the library shelves".  I had to force myself to finish this, and will say that the final postscript was the best part of the whole. 
 This book just didn't get started for me.  I'm still trying to get interested in it...and for me not to be able to keep a Marcia Muller book in my hands until I'm done is unthinkable. 
 Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad. Pages are falling out 
 One of the worst albums of all time from one of the worst bands of all time. That's all I have to say.. 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 I was very disappointed in this book, and not just because it is difficult.  I was mainly disappointed because rather than explaining religion, Boyer explained the "transmission" of religious beliefs.  He explains the influence of "memes" (cultural archetypes)on people's beliefs, but he doesn't explain why some people reject them and believe something else 
 Skip this one and go for the original AGING WELL by Dr. Jeanne Wei, which came out a couple of years before this..., which even uses a similar jacket design!  AGING WELL by Jeanne Wei is much more comprehensive and practical than this new pretender, and I learned a lot more about how to manage my life to stay young 
 This little drive worked great for two weeks and then, suddenly, all of my files are gone.  There is no physical damage to the device and it still comes up in XP but sans any files 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 Anytime anyone stands up and writes logically about abortion, the people who want to change the laws based on their religious beliefs start  slandering both the facts and the character of the writers. Read this book for yourself, then check out the historical facts.  Abortion is not for everyone. Banning abortion is not for everyone. Each religious organization should set standards for their own adherants. The rest of us do not have to follow them. 
 Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :- 
 that people could read this book and not be the least bit suspicious or inquisitive about the sources of a man who writes for a right wing publication, "Human Events." Even the subtitle, "That Undermine the War on Terror," is speculative for which the author provides no explanation while suggesting sedition by Americans opposed to the war. That alone, is heavy-handed.  There are two contentions that I would like to address from this book: Haliburton is not profiting from their contracts in Iraq, and 2) Iraq really did have WMD's.  If Halliburton is barely making ends meet with its open-ended, no-bid contract, then don't they owe it to their shareholders to pull out of Iraq toward more profit-making ventures? Shouldn't their board of directors be thrown out? Has anyone bothered to check Halliburton's northward stock march since 2003? A look at Ameritrade from Aug 06 to July 06 shows that the company has almost doubled it's price share!  It's hard to imagine a company cannot make money after being forgiven a $60 million dollar penalty for overcharging the government for things like $45 for a case of coca-cola, or $100 for a bag of laundry, or underfeeding our troops at Halliburton-run messhalls? Haven't they been charging the government for feeding the regiment three squares a day, seven days a week? So, whose running this company into the ground anyway, and leaving it awash in red ink?   Now, for the author's proof that there were WMD's in Iraq:  If we really did discover weapons of mass destruction, as Miniter claims, wouldn't this administration have trumpeted this information worldwide? How come even they are admitting that WMD's don't exist, and never did? Even the US Army Chemical Corps stated the chemicals they found, which Miniter proclaims as proof, were just chemicals and not chemical weapons. The sarin was so degraded from age, it would have been wholly ineffective. The low grade uranium was already bagged and tagged by the U.N. years earlier. Incidentally a lot of countries have that amount of uranium. Does that mean they are making WMD's, and are we going to invade them too?  It was tough reading this when I suspected that Miniter was clutching anecdotal straws to reinforce his preconceived beliefs. His work and sources will not withstand serious scrutiny. He had made numerous factual gaffes, an indication of careless editing and miniscule research. And he uses inductive reasoning to draw his conclusions.  Judging by some of his five star reviews, it's obvious that his conclusions matched his readers' expectations. It's unlikely however, a reader will challenge what he or she already wants to believe.  Mr. Miniter, just because lemons are yellow, and your car may be yellow, doesn't prove that your car is a lemon. It only proves that your car has yellow paint 
 I bought this book to help deal with my 6 year old's nightmares.  There wasn't really anything about that in the book.  I thought the name implied the book would mostly be about bedtime fears but really it is a generalized book about 30 or so fears a child may have so it really didn't help me at all.  There doesn't seem to be depth of analysis of any of the fears and I can't imagine the book would be useful to many people. I don't necessarily think this is a "bad book", I just didn't find it helpful for me and don't see it really being helpful to most people, but if you just want a book with a little bit about a lot of fears, this would be a very good book for you 
 I gave it a chance and not suprisingly I was thoroughly sickened. This is one of the latest in a crop of Hip Hop crime dramas featuring the same horrible rappers that fuel the ... soundtracks in the acting roles. This movie left a foul taste in my mouth and quite a headache. This is further proof that Rap is ruining all forms of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this incorrigible trash. Word Yo 
 Now, don't get me wrong - I am a Starhawk fan, and I am a Pagan.  I loved 'Spiral Dance', and enjoyed 'Dreaming the Dark' and 'Truth or Dare'.  I really did want to enjoy this book.  However, Starhawk's considerable literary talents do not seem to cross over into the realm of fiction.  What's wrong with this book?  Well for a start, it's VERY simplistic.  The pagans are all loving, bi-sexual, multi-cultural and good.  The christians are all fundamentalist, violent, middle class and bad.  The pagans are a little too perfect and a little too self-satisfied with their own cunning to be truly engaging characters.  I agree that it's rare and lovely to have a novel where the pagan characters are good people, but this is a bit heavy-handed.   Secondly, Starhawk shies away from addressing any really hard questions.  Everything about the pagan utopia is great.  Everything about the fundamentalist regime is bad.  There's no dialogue between the two groups at all, and no suggestion that the two might learn anything from each other.    Thirdly, the plot is a stinker.  It is nothing but a vehicle to express Starhawk's philosophy.  The characters are wooden, and the plot is very predictable.     I really wanted to like this book.  Instead, it made me cringe.  Bottom line?  Read any non-fiction work by Starhawk.  If you want to read good pagan fiction, try 'Mists of Avalon' (Marion Zimmer Bradley), 'The Light Bearer' (Donna Gillespie), or even Wyrd Sisters (Terry Pratchett). 
 I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.  Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem 
 I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.  Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  "Tant pis, vers le bonheur. 
 This is a beautifully produced book with magnificent colored pictures. In many ways, I think it would be better without the text. The history, basic beliefs, and traditions of each religion are not presented in a concise or  coherent manner. I would be unable to give anyone a succinct summary of any  of the religions discussed by relying on this book alone. None of the  subject religions seem to be treated seriously, and they all come off as a  bit silly. Perhaps the silliness of organized religion can't be hidden  behind words, but other books have done a better job of obfuscating that  fact 
 You will still need to buy the AC cord for this unit.  This is not a charger.  It's essentially a $30.00 piece of plastic that holds the Q upright.  
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 As someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it. After reading many of these Amazon reviews though, I opted out of a purchase, and took it out of my Bronx library instead. Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time, and not any money.  This book is a sham. It is obviously mostly fiction. And it's boring fiction at that. The book is divided into chapters, each chapter a new "adventure."   I read the subway one first, where the "explorers" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line, to see the City Hall Station, which opened in 1904 (NYC's first station) and closed in 1948. The station is located on the loop of the 6 train, that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge. First of all, anyone can go on this "adventure." Just stay on the train at the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge, and that's it. Despite the author's attempt to make this sound risky, no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care), just sit down. The author created some "European tourists" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop, and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying "are we on the wrong train?" Well, unless all those huge "6" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read, then you probably got on the correct train. The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11. This chapter was a joke.  I started reading the other chapters, and saw they were no better. I then started to breeze through the book. One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all. This, despite the fact that on page 67 the author states, "Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle..."  But no photos of their "adventures" are in the book. Why? Because it's fiction.   There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring, sure, that's easy. There's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere, ooo. Buit no pics of the actual "adventures." I guess "Josh" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed.  The funny thing is, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself. Especially the City Hall station, there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours.  Just stay away from this sham of a book, it's really a huge waste of time 
 What on earth are you thinking? Nobody is going to pay that much for this game unless it has a portal to the deminsion of Toyland. 
 It would have been much better if this book had never been written.  The story in this volume takes place in the time period after the wandering photographer (Robert Kincaid) left Madison County, Iowa, following his short love affair with the conventional wife of an Iowa farmer (Francesca Johnson), until his death.  Actually there is not much discussion about Francesca; rather the story is focused on Robert's new discovery of his forgotten son produced from a one-night sexual encounter with a free-spirited girl in Northern California when Robert was much younger.  This epilogue dilutes the beautiful love story between Robert and Francesca described in The Bridges of Madison County, which I have always defended against pretentious friends who regarded it as a trashy romance novel.  It appears to me that Robert James Waller was forced to write this terrible "A Thousand Country Roads" for some reason which I don't understand 
 This is an out of date look at the Japanese.  Ruth Benedict interviewed Japanese in the United States during the last years of World War II.  After the war Benedict had a chance to visit Japan and talk to Japanese in Japan,  but elected not to do so.  Therefore, this book is jaded and misrepresents  the Japanese.  Other books are better and give a truer picture of the  Japanese 
 My fiance and I purchased this item thinking it would make a great addition to our room. The pictures looked great. As it turns out, the product is not as nice. The chairs are too shallow (not deep enough) to be comfortable and leave a large unsightly gap between the seat and bottom swivel portion. Also, the color does not appear to be Espresso, but rather black/brown.  I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN 
 I usually really hate to critize a book like this, but this book was not  what I expected it to be.  This book was to be romantic suspense, but where  was the romance?  This book focused mainly on the mystery(which was solved  by the the time you reached the middle of the book), and then the story  kinda dragged on,  probably to finish the love story.  The love story was  okay, but there was no serious focus on it and it just kinda closed off.   In the end, for my first book by Krentz, it was not the greatest 
 To lead off, the author of the book was long-time Cleveland, OH, print media sports reporter/columnist Russell Schneider. When Schneider retired from his post at The Plain Dealer - still a major daily at the time - he wrote a weekly column for a minor weekly newspaper chain and turned his attention to a variety of book projects, including Covering All The Bases.  Boudreau was a legend in Cleveland as an all-star shortstop and player/manager - taking the helm at age 24. The 1948 team - one of the greatest in MLB history - went from world champions to the big screen, starring in a typical sports film at the time, The Kid From Cleveland.  The Hall-of-Famer was also known by millions of Cubs fans for his nearly three decades of work on radio broadcasts on WGN. Boudreau also had a brief stint playing pro basketball in the National Basketball League, the forerunner to the National Basketball Association.  With nearly a lifetime of professional baseball to reflect upon, it is surprising that Schneider focuses so much on Boudreau's statistics rather than drawing out anecdotes to highlight the achievements. Schneider does a good job having Boudreau comment on his controversial loss of collegiate eligibility at the University of Illinois for signing a letter of intent to play for Cleveland upon graduating, but there are really no journalistic high points afterwards.  A series of book signings in northeast Ohio were greatly scaled back due to Boudreau's worsening health problems. Though even more than a decade after the publication, there are still new autographed books available for readers who like to comb through bookstores in northeast Ohio.  For baseball fans who enjoy statistics over ruminations, Covering All The Bases is a hit. But Schneider could have done so much more to make Boudreau's career come to life.   
 I was hoping to see some concert footage of early UFO but, didn't get to see a single song played in its entirety!  BS commentary, etc. fill most of this DVD.  SAVE YOUR MONEY 
 I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists.  The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color.  The storyline, however, is amateurish.  Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable.  Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan?  And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother?  DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician?  The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics.  The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive.  Were his parents abusive?  Why the displaced agression towards Bruce?  The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama.  I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there.  I wished the writing lived up to the art work 
 The Dyson DC07 works well enough in the upright position, but if you are planning on using the attachments, prepare to be disappointed.  There is zero maneuverability, mediocre suction, completely awkward positioning, and it is an overall nightmare.  The hose is stiff and ended up tipping the canister onto the floor, scratching the wood and making me wonder why I bought the machine in the first place 
 I based my purchase of this book on the review here on these web pages by psychologist Craig Chalquist, based on his comment (in effect) that life well-lived necessarily has highs and lows in it, one must accept, even embrace both dark and light phases, as a tree needs both sunlight and dark night to fulfill its potential.  It was with that understanding well in hand I began reading St. John of the Cross.  Other reviewers have said it's difficult to read, perhaps because of the tranlator's stated goal of being as true to the 16th-century Spanish as possible, not rewriting it to make it more accessible and losing the literary voice of the original which, apparently, is the more important value of this work.  I don't have a problem with the language, and it's not a big book, just over 200 pages, but I haven't quite finished reading it and I'm not sure if I will (oh, I probably will) because something about it makes my skin crawl. I reject this sort of ascetic mysticism on grounds that it's philosophically flawed--it's the tortuously convoluted path of a labyrinth from which one exits by the same gate as one entered, and for what?  To me it suggests nothing more than pathological, compulsive, sado-masochistic auto-eroticism.  Union with God, indeed; get your hand out of your pants, go outside:  God is everywhere.  Turn off the computer, get some exercise; let God find you.  I shall serve no god who demands obedience from slaves; my god loves me for my willful independence.  If we are made in God's image, does that mean God is a self-flagellating crybaby?  Get up!  Get on your feet!  Be Lightning!  Be Thunder!  Be Earthquake and Avalanche!  Be Iceberg and Volcano, Tidalwave and Twister! Make God proud!  Don't buy this book! 
 I received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my Canon Rebel XT Camera.  Followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail.  It appears that this remote is defective 
 This book is a great example of the passive exploitation of the college textbook market. Publishers have perfected the art of having an expert slap together material that is not elaborated upon enough for advanced students, or which repackages information that can be obtained cheaply (or freely) elsewhere. Then the publisher can charge a grossly inflated price for the book, encourage professors to require it for students, then keep the price high by forcing scarcity in the marketplace for those same students who are forced to buy a copy at any cost. This particular book will only ever be purchased by college students in communications law, most of whom can get 99.9% of the knowledge herein for FREE. Here's the rub - this book is almost entirely made up of reprints of court case documents, which record the rulings and reasonings of judges. But if you are a college student - that is, a member of the only possible market demographic for this book - then your college probably offers free or inexpensive access to database services (such as LexisNexis or WestLaw) that compile this information for scholars.   In this book, the "author" Zelezny has supplied a brief introduction that is so brief as to be useless. Then each chapter has an introductory page that features a paragraph on the overall topic, followed by a list of one-sentence descriptions of why each of the selected cases is of interest. Then the court documents for each of the cases are simply reproduced (with some omissions that enhance brevity but damage full learning), and only a handful of those cases are supported by any explanatory introductions or conclusions from Zelezny. In short, Zelezny just barely tells you why he's reprinting information that is free elsewhere. Instead of buying this completely extraneous book, the student would be better served by simply learning which cases are considered classics in communications law, then reading the cases (plus their supporting documents to boot) on the computer network offered by the campus that holds the class that requires this book. Guess which one costs less. [~doomsdayer520~] 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 She has alot of wonderful ideas. If it is a new concept for you to have  play and joy in your marriage, pick up this book.She is the pide piper .The ride with her is a blast.But reader be warned of what is behind her teachings.She is simplistic and even cruel.  She has no respect for anyone who disagrees with her.She puts down feminism,therapy,medication and 12 step programs. In her view,addiction,abuse,even depression is a choice.Her worshiping followers hide the fact that they get help from other sources than her,for fear of reproachment.And if you disagree with her,you are called a loser.

 I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 Bought this to replace my old 2200 Ipaq; Man what a mistake! The battery is always dead, even after the HP tech support for hours on 3 seperate occasions; Patch downloads done nothing, lost information, reloads, Bugs to many to mention. I wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before I purchased it. All the good features it has don't hold a candle to all the troubles it has. I'd be very careful if your looking to buy this model. Da 
 First things first.  The most important thing to recognize about this book is that the majority of it (about 2/3) was not actually written by Jesse Livermore.  It was written by Richard Smitten, a man who tries (and fails miserably) to create a sort of monologue of Livermore, complete with phony quotation marks, in which the great trader outlines his system.  Having said that, Livermore's actual writings are very interesting.  The first few chapters of the book is a word for word transcript of Livermore's original text, and contains much in the way of useful insight and helpful tips and information.  The Livermore Market Key at the end of the book is also Livermore's creation, and it, too, is useful in its own way. 	 The rest of the book is cobbled together by Richard Smitten, a man who seems to have made it his life's work to piggyback on Livermore's success in order to make a name for himself.  Smitten took letters and interview transcripts and pieced together a phony Livermore monologue.  It is unconvincing and a complete waste of time.  The writing is abysmal, and Livermore's concise points and techniques (from the first part of the book, the part Livermore actually wrote) are repeated over and over and befuddled to the point that you have to remember that it is not actually Livermore speaking.  Smitten's attempt to adopt Livermore's style of conversation fails miserably, and the whole of his work is tedious to the power of ten.  I couldn't even get through it-I had to skip to the Livermore Market Key at the back.    The book also contains some shameless self-promotion in which Smitten attempts to peddle his biography of Livermore onto the reader and also his trading system, which he shamelessly claims will help you trade like the great legend.  Smitten's writing is so awful I would never even consider anything else written by him-his seeming inability to create a concise sentence without a run on and his ineptitude at using question marks when necessary waxes tiresome in a hurry.  The best book about Livermore's trading style is Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and that book will get you closer to understanding the real Jesse Livermore than this drivel ever will.  Aside from Livermore's own words (the only redeeming factor here), this book is utterly useless 
 This book goes way overboard in the networking areas and scrimps on areas such as firewall topologies, intellectual property and standard types of hacks.  A lot of the information about servers and networking goes way over your head unless you already know about the topic, and about half the info on networking is just touched on superficially on the exam.  If you use this book to study, you're going to spend way too much time on networking and you won't know about a third of the other things -- HTML and JavaScript coding, for example -- that you need to know for the exam 
 This book is garbage. Tell me of one documented case of human ill-effects from GMO's and maybe I will sway. Recently the Zambian gov't turned down 18000 tons of emergency grain from the US because it was GM. People died of starvation as a result. At least take the time to get the other side of the story before taking this book as the gospel truth. I respect Nader for alot of the things he has done. This book is certainly not on that list 
 Gives a good overview to US-Philippines economic, social and political relations.  Good detail yet easy to read due to a well developed writing style. The authors' many anecdotal observations were annotated, thereby helping to reveal potential biases, unlike many writings.  Strongly recommended for any studies of Philippines 20th century history. 
 I was looking for a book to help with an upcoming trip to Glacier National Park area, but this one didn't fit the bill.  While I wanted suggestions for things to do, day trip recommendations, trail information, etc., this book is more like a "yellow pages" of Montana.  Want to know about motels?  It's here.  Want to plan activities?  Probably not the right book.  It's all black and white, very large (too large to pack), maps are scarce.  I'm going to look for a different option. 
 Having completed the camino de santiago and read this book I see no relation between the two. One reviewer said that maybe something had been lost in translation-this may be a tactful way of saying that this book is actually tedious and vastly over rated.The setting is the camino but frankly could have been anywhere else as specific references seem to be lacking-and are probably irelevant to the story.I also found some of the mystical aspects just plain mumbo jumbo-maybe it's just me or maybe others did not like this book but are afraid to be critical of such a 'great' book 
 Lent to me 'cause I'm such a mystery fan.  But I couldn't get over the fact that Anne Perry is herself a convicted murderer and if I bought her books I'd be contributing to her profit off her murder.    From Time: "When mystery writer Anne Perry was 15, she committed murder. She and her friend, Pauline, killed Pauline's mother. Perry served 5 1/2 years in an adult women's prison. After her release, she left New Zealand and has never returned. Now living in Scotland, Perry has fashioned a new life and a successful career. Although family and close friends knew about Perry's past, it was never known to the general public, including her agent and her U.S. publisher. The New Zealand film, Heavenly Creatures, deals with the 1954 case. A New Zealand reporter uncovered Perry's previous identity as Juliet Hulme. Perry insists she does not remember specifics of the actual crime."  Watch the documentary "Heavenly Creatures" for the facts.  It's just gross that she got off so light for murder and is now rich because she writes about how to committ murders.  She's not wise, she's opportunistic 
 Ray Johnson is a virtually unknown figure of the Pop Art scene and his story is filled with interesting figures from New York at the time. Additionally his suicide puts a tragic spin on his biography. I was disappointed though once I saw that 'How to Draw a Bunny' was not going to let the viewer at the information so easily. What you do get is interesting enough but it comes with an soundtrack consisting of drum riffs that is engineered at the same level as the interviews which proved to be very distracting. About 30 minutes into the film I realized that I had yet to see any of Johnson's work in the film. When it does appear it is quickly cut, cropped, or shown in bits.   'HTDAB' does not suffer from lack of information. After a while, I got the feeling that the filmmaker had almost too much information and interviews often stray off unrelated to each other. I was left to wonder why some anecdotes went on for five minutes while other more interesting ones were cut off to quickly.  At times too much of a 'personal touch' interferes with the film. Why for instance do we need to see a re-creation of a valentine xerox work of Johnson? Was the filmmaker concerned that it might serve to undermine the actual work? Its not too much of a shame...you get the point of the film -and Johnson's collage and xerox work- rather quickly but the details that are supposed to be the meat of any documentary are downplayed by the garnish.  
 There is NOTHING of science in this sliver of a book.  This book Summed up:  You must think Rich Use thought to bring form to the formless Thank god so it will occur. When it doesn't occur, you either weren't thankful enough to god or failed to think hard enough about being rich. PURE SCIENCE!    I could understand someone in 1910 being impressed by this work, along with maybe animal-magnetism or iridology, but only a half-wit would be compelled by any of this today 
 Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received.  I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04.  Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet 
 This book wasn't great. I don't like the format of this book the way it was written by several different contributors. I don't feel it has any particular flow or direction. It touches of some supplements and on the macro and micronutrients but doesn't outline any particular diets for anything. If you want to read a little about effervescent creatine, a little about protein, a little about calcium, and a little about a few other topics then I guess this book would be for you but you can find way better information in other books or online. I don't recommend this book 
 Seemed like it was probably early in Yuen Baio's career. The fighting was very slow paced and measured... The story was pretty decent I guess, but the acting was really bad. That being said, the story really isn't capable of driving this movie. If you put the fights in fast forward it's a good watch 
 I only watched this movie to see how bad it would be. Unfortunately I was proved right. I absolutely loved the original care bear movies from the 80's but this was awful compared to them. To borrow an old saying: "out with the new in with the old".     
 I found out about this artist and this cd while watching the Early Show on  CBS one Saturday morning.  They played one song off the cd that sounded quite good. Sorry to say, there is only one or maybe two other songs that are worthwhile of my cash.   
 Much too expensive, for such a kind of book 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 I ordered it on 9/9.  At the beginning it would come middle of October.  It was OK.  However, delivery schedule had been changed.  It is not arrived yet, nor I do not know when it will come.  Amazon knows this delay.  However, they asked me to send a review of it.  What does it mean?  I rated this item as  1-star; it is not for the item, but for the seller, Amason. Amazon is generally good campany, I think.  However, I cannot accept my situation for this.  Honestly saying, I want to rate 0-star for this order 
 I was very disappointed with these sheets. If I had not thrown away the bag, I would have returned... (Instead my pug inherited them for his bed)  They are poor quality workmanship and the fabric is cheap. I purchased them to match my Croscill Versailles set. They did provide a visual pop, but were a nightmare to sleep in. If you like the sensation of sleeping in wet plastic wrap and flush money down the toilet for entertainment, these are the sheets for you. If you want comfort and durability, stick with a 100% cotton 400+ thread count sateen sheet 
 I am used to making projects for which dimensions for the various pieces are provided.  Not only does the author fail to provide dimensions but he also fails to even talk about some of the pieces that are part of a given  project 
 Have read all three of this series, and will read no more.  Geoffrey Frost, the lead character, never quite reaches two dimensions, let alone three.  He is always perfect in his tactics, his plans, and his response to any situation.  The dialogue is wooden, and self-consciously done in the style of the period, to the point that it becomes a distraction.  In this book, the story is also highly implausible, and requires a suspension of belief that belies its intention as an authentic period piece.  And it's not just the primary character who is perfect: the "woods-cruizers" are all always in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, never miss a shot, always give sage counsel, and so on.  The few villains that show up are all quickly redeemed by their mere exposure to Geoffrey Frost.  I admit that I am holding this series to standards of Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin, which are classics, and by that standard, Geoffrey Frost only rates a C+.  If you absolutely must read this series, do so at the library's expense, and not your own 
 While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min, the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min.  Even after getting new batteries (which turned out NOT to be the problem) I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was "scammed".  It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones 
 This book was lacking something. There were alot of times in the book where it dragged and I was tempted to put it down. I was simply disappointed with this book. I don't think that E Lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse 
 Way too many names, Way too much detail. There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read. 
 This book gives you a general overview only. In most situations I had to refer to the Pro Tools reference guide to get a detailed explanation in order to do what needed to be done. Yes, the reference guide is 650 pg plus. But you can easily browse through bookmarks to find the topic you are looking for.  I guess, if you have no idea what you are doing, and don't know what to look for in the reference guide in the first place, this book could direct you there when needed.  I have also taken some on line Berklee Music classes with this author, but that is a completely different structure. Great class if you can afford it 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 The author is not an expert on jade at all. Features pieces from own private collection and some of the descriptions are obviously inaccurate (eg. Goddess of Mercy holding a fly swatter???!!!). Would give it -ve stars if possible. I am also aghast that the publishers did not have more rigorous standards 
 It's rather hard to review the product. I ordered from Kid Concoctions over a month ago and still haven't received my order and they won't reply to my emails 
 No scent that I could tell, and totally melted down all over everything in less than three hours. 
 It reads exactly as you would expect, as an adventure based on a video game designed by Douglas Adams but penned entirely by the Minister of Silly Walks.    For me, it was disappointing.  
 Summary:  I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.    In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.    Hardware, OS, & primary software used:  1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office 2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office 3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's games  Prior virus/spyware products:  Lattitude & X1: Norton Dimension: freeware provided by our ISP  Theory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS & office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.    Lesson:  Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time:   1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD & downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.    2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good.   3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude & Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.    4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.    5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.    6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection.  
 This book provides a good overview of reflections of the late Terence McKenna, a celebrated icon of the contemporary psychedelic scene and discussion, comparable perhaps with Timothy Leary in the 1960's.  For the curious reader, "Food of the Gods" offers a rich insight into his thought and its appeal. But that appeal turns out to be rather narrow and limited, unfortunately. Like Leary, McKenna commanded considerable attention, reaching a wide audience and achieving some degree of celebrity. But as reflected in the pages of this book, his analysis and views turn out to be surprisingly (I would even say disappointingly) weak, and fatally biased, with no solid substance.    I am sure McKenna must have been a very nice man from what people say, and I don't necessarily suspect he was a dishonest person.  Nor is he a bad writer.  But for a subject as interesting as the human impact of hallucinogenic fungi, the discussion McKenna offers here leaves a lot to be desired.  He tends to jump precipitously to his conclusions, and tries to support his arguments by speculation, often idle in nature, and rarely qualified with any semblance of scholarly rigor. This is surprising (and again, disappointing) because he is apparently well educated.    For example, the glare of Lamarcke's error is blinding in McKenna's speculations that psilocybin mushrooms may have catalyzed the very evolution of our species from its hominid ancestry. This is a good example of the kind of thought that seems to have excited so many readers of McKenna's works.  But if you have a minimally sound understanding of the idea of natural selection, its actually a little bit insulting to your intelligence (not that I think he meant it to be).  McKenna's thesis of the extraterrestrial origin of Stropharia cubensis gleefully throws any and all pretense of informed reason to the wind, and I'm sure that's a lot of fun--but only in a cartoony, conceptually childish way.   Readers seeking a more balanced understanding about psilocybin mushrooms will scratch their heads at how oblivious McKenna seems to findings from science.  To me his writings recall "scientific creationists" and their style of argument.  In fact, along these lines, one of the worst flaws in this book is its stifling, overbearing, disaffecting ideological rigidity.  It is almost like what one sometimes sees in "creationism" but of opposite, left-wing rather than right-wing, character.  The more different, the more the same? This is hokey, corny stuff, and actually not interesting, unless you are really into, well, overt propaganda really, about the "partnership" society of prehistory, and the "dominator" culture, and ... it just goes off into this sort of hambone rhetorical bait for anyone who will snap at it.  Here, a lot of fashionable, widely circulating fairy tales about prehistory and pre-industrialized culture are installed at the foundation, where only a better informed theoretical perspective could serve.  Its Rousseau's "noble savage" all over again, with PC retooling.  (From my perspective, notions that other peoples are better or worse than we are, especially if they are really really different from us, probably tend to distort our image, and capacity for humane understanding, of both them and ourselves, sooner or later).  One seeks in vain for a connection of any significance in this book to the prior works of pioneers such as Huxley, Alan Watts, Huston Smith, and R. Gordon Wasson, whose comments about the personal power and impact of their experiences with psilocybin mushrooms and/or similar agents are so insightful.  McKenna actually challenges Wasson's thesis about Soma, suggesting it was not Amanita muscaria but ... you guessed it ... Stropharia cubensis.  And true to form, he offers nothing amounting to evidence, only a chain of poorly reasoned supposition and speculations--a far cry from the exhaustive research and painstaking studies upon which Wasson based his theory.   McKenna argues his ideas with all the passion he can muster, and perhaps this explains part of his appeal for some readers, especially if they share in his brand of polarized politics (note the unbridled enthusiasm on parade in many of the reviews posted here). So if firing your imagination with a lot of wild and wooly psychedelic surmises is your cup of tea, you will perhaps find this book entertaining.  Its really a dalliance in mental self-stimulation for anyone whose tastes it appeals to.  If a sound, well-informed perspective about a subject as important and interesting as ethnobotany is what you seek, well, this book is still good in that you can get a clear, detailed picture of the Terence McKenna phenomenon, and what it represents as a body of ideas or thought, what it is all about, the better for you to be able to evaluate its relative merits.    Apart from that, this is essentially an uninteresting book on a fascinating subject.  I would prefer to bear happier tidings, but "Food of the Gods" really fails to deliver a discussion worthy of the visionary promise of personal experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, compelling and glittering as that promise is.    But don't take my word for it, read the book and see for yourself what you think.  The good news is, if the king within it looks naked, you need not think there is anything wrong with you, even if you don't hear others around you mentioning this surprising fact. (BTW, McKenna's does have some good essays such as "Wasson's Literary Precursors" where his scholarship and writing can shine without being muddled by a lot of prank speculation, but they are not to be found in this book.)  
 Having started and built two successful magazines, I was horrified by this book. The title alone should have tipped me off. "How NOT to Start a Magazine." The author admits she was unsuccessful at starting a magazine, so why would anyone who is serious about a new magazine project want her advice? It's like asking John Kerry for advice on how to successfully run for President. This book contains very little useful information. It's a blueprint for failure. If you plan to fail with your new publication, read this book. It's worthless 
 When "Pearl Harbor" came out three years after "Saving Private Ryan", I was hoping for a similar dramatic blockbuster that infused admirable and likable characters into an action-filled, heart-tugging, and well-directed/produced movie.  Instead (and how can I articulately put this?) well, quite frankly, it sucked.  The acting was extremely poor in the lead roles (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale).  Even with the number of high-quality actors in it (i.e., Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Josh Hartnett, etc.) they were not enough to save this film.  The special effects, however, were quite remarkable and one of the few bright spots in this cinematic bummer.  Unfortunately, these first-rate effects didn't make up for the awful acting 
 Crump was featured in the book BABIES FOR SALE: the Tennessee Children's Home Adoption Scandal by Linda Tollett Austin.  If you want to know about Crump that is the book to read.    Edward Crump was a typical city boss who sold favors out of public office.  This made the rights of citizens dependent on what they could afford to buy.  Crump enforced the poll taxes that charged people money for the 'right' to vote.  Crump was big in bootlegging and prostitution.  He was the architech of the Memphis 'baby selling' scandal brought to light by Senator Estes Kefauver in 1950.  Crump appointed both women in the scandal.  Georgia Tann or Camile Kelley were Crump's employees.  These women took the heat for Crump's crimes.   This book is PR for a criminal.    
 I checked this book out at my local library thinking there might actually be something useful to help me diversify my online income.  I was greatly disappointed.  Not only does this book repeat what just about every other book on earning money online talks about, but it also involves many things that could be considered SPAM and annoying practices.  The author states he is against those practices and insists that his techiniques are fine, but I can't help but get a bit sick to my stomach when reading his tips.  Also, he claims its super-easy to make lots of quick money, but even with his deceiptful tactics, you will still need a good product (which he doesn't tell you how to develop) in order to sell anything worthwhile.  Please do yourself and the rest of the Internet community a favor and don't both with this book

 A great idea poorly executed.  The construction is cheap.  The screen is marginal at best.  But worst of all, it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras I have on hand or a USB card reader.  A piece of junk that I am now returnin 
 Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have "briefed" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.  It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the "testimony" is second-hand).   The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that "Disclosure" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even "written" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.   The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.  In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.  Tragically disorganized efforts like "Disclosure" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but "Disclosure," for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.   
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening. 
 S.E. Frost is either highly misinformed on Christian matters, or a liar. He states that we have never been able to answer the problem of evil and sin, which we have. He declares that we do not know who created the devil, and we do. He does have a couple of gems in the book, but if you are a Christian, or atleast open to truths, even the ones you don't like. I believe they would be better found elsewhere 
 Kudos to the 'reader' from North Brunswick NJ for his observations. Just to briefly give some detail to his comments: regarding Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith "to which every Jew must assent," no less an (Orthodox) authority than Nachmanides (the Ramban) takes issue with the 7th principle, that Moses' level of prophecy exceeds that of all others. See "Kitvei Ramban" (ed. Chavel) page 322/323, where after discussing the relative insight of Abraham, Moses and the angels, Ramban states that Mashiach will have a fuller understanding of God than them. Ralbag (Gersonides) states a similar opinion. Regarding the 8th principle, that the Torah we have today is exactly what Moses received, although the transmission process has been meticulous, there are many traditional (orthodox) sources that acknowledge that this may very likely not be the case. Tractate Soferim in the Babylonian Talmud makes references to variant readings, the Midrash in Bamidbar Rabba "describes" a visit to Ezra the scribe by Elijah the prophet where the nekudot (dots over the Masoretic Hebrew text) are characterized as signs pointing out words/letters of "questionable" authenticity. One can also mention the phenomenon of Ketiv u'Keri (words spelled one way in the Torah, yet pronounced differently) as reflecting some uncertainty in the text. Although it is a mitzvah (commandment) for one to write for himself a Torah scroll, the halacha (law) is that the scribe does not make a blessing prior to writing precisely due to the uncertainty of the text. Maimonides himself is known to have searched extensively for an "accurate" text of the Torah. His eight principle is believed to have arisen as a polemic to the masses, who were being accused by their Islamic neighbors that Jews had changed/falsified the Torah. This is an example of what he termed  "necessary opinion" as opposed to a "correct opinion." Even Rashi, who no one as of yet has accused of not being Orthodox, seems to have a version of the Torah with an extra letter "vav" that does not appear in our text in parashat Teruma. As regards the Oral Law, the very existence of Machloket (differences of opinion) among the sages suggests that, yes, while the Torah and much of what is embodied in the Talmud is of Sinaitic origin, once it was given to Man, it became vulnerable to human imperfection in the process of transmission ("Lo bashamayin Hee"  - the Torah is not in heaven 
 The cover blurb says "flawless writer." Correction: Benedict tries -- too hard -- to create an "acerbic" character by having her drop celebrity names and have a profession that's too cool for words. Too People Magazine for me. I get the idea -- I've been a divorcee in love with her own fantasy singlehood, too -- but it doesn't work, especially with the too-abrupt shift to the deep feeler/thinker she becomes when confronted with a messy real life. Other people -- Gordon, Tyler, and Quindlen to name three -- have done it better, and truly flawlessly when it comes to writing. Maybe it's me, not wanting to wallow in the nasty lives in a large cast of unlikable people. It's like watching ugly soap stars: I have to look at enough ugly people in real life, I don't want to see them on TV, too. The novel was so bad I skipped the parts that had the pretty, and redeeming, Swansea descriptions in them just to find out what comes next so I could turn out the light and go to sleep 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 He makes sound like the wall street market works like the casino. In the real world it doesn't work all of the time. I didn't loose money, but I did practice it for 5 months as a game and was only making 4% . 
 i was so happy when i first purchased this book but when i finally sat and read it, it was so boring and a drag it was a waste. The story had no purpose nothing was really going on it. This book is juss a waste don't buy this book i wish i coulda gave it no stars it was juss that bad buy beware don't read this 
 Prof. Gardner's book is disappointing. He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first. Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity. For example, he believes in building up the inner world of "mental representations" [unexplained term] yet insists on "performances of understanding" [another unexplained term].   Also, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the "position" or "situation" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place. Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.  The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.  In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner. It would be kind to say he is eclectic. I hope it's just not fuzzy thinking.  However, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness. Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not! His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal. I don't like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.  When attacking E.D. Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for "cultural literacy," he sets up a straw man. He says that Hirsch's school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian "tabula rasa." Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch's writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa.   Further, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top. Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best. Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner's presentation.    Believe me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn. If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?  I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner's part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence.   The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.  Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?  Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence? I don't think so. Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate.   Lastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton. The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense. Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.  As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.    In this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.  
 How can someone get something so wrong, and yet still have apologists who defend him, and believers who buy his books?  There's lots of money to be made in Doomsday predictions if you can rationalize taking the money from the fools that will buy your pitch.  This books predicts the world will starve to death due to overpopulation.  Only problem, the predictions were made decades ago and they were all wrong. We're still here.  Maybe he can write a book on global warming.. 
 ...and were just looking for a legitimate excuse, you should definitely read this book. Any Red Sox fan who was devastated by his defection to the hated Yankees should definitely give this one a whirl, as you will come away thinking, "Good riddance." You also come away with the understanding that for Johnny, it's all about himself and it's all about the money.  What this book is NOT is a good behind-the-scenes look at the 2004 Red Sox. You get a few good bits, but not enough to justify the price of the book. What you get a lot more of is Johnny Damon being repulsively full of himself. His statement that "I banged 9 women during my wife's 36-hour labor" was absolutely appalling and morally repugnant. Then he has the gall to blame HER for their divorce because she was "too paranoid." The book was pretty badly written and was full of typographical errors and factual mistakes that every casual fan will pick up on. I knew from previous input I had from others that I might not like the book, but I didn't expect to come away flat-out hating the guy. That is what this book will do to you. The degree of selfishness and boastfulness is nauseating.   Please save your money. If you MUST read it, get it from a library 
 The CD does not work in either my CD player of in my computer 
 This author understands absolutely nothing about Russian or Soviet history.  If you wish to worship Ronald Reagan, this is the book for you!  If you want to understand Russian and Soviet politics, history (warts and all) don't waste your time, you will find almost total propaganda.    His comments and quotes from Gorbachev, however, are appreciated. It is about time Americans got over their "gorby love".  I saw this author on BookTV -- he cannot even pronounce Russian names correctly, let alone get very much right about Russian people and Soviet life (one example:  Russian churches were open to the public and widely attended during the Soviet period, even if Lenin and Marx were absolutely right about religion!)  Finally, this author fails to discuss how that sick triumvarate of Thatcher, Reagan and Gorbachev are very much responsible for a terrible upsetting of the power balance in the world, which has got us the mess we have today.  Russia and the former republics are in a pathetic state of ruin. Regions formerly controlled by the Soviets (including Afghanistan)are overrun with terrorists, resulting already in great tragedy, and who knows what will come next.  And this author waxes *poetic'* about how much "credit" should be given to such insanity.  The author is either utterly deluded or supremely stupid. 
 This movie was on TNT and the dvd will not make it any better. This might be worse then Viva Knievel from 1977. While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . You never find out why Evel started to jump for a living. They never show the showman part of Evel. Instead they show really stupid things like Evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie. 
 I have Sue Waters newer book which is done very well. I was very disappointed when I got this, her older book, to discover that the projects were very amaturish.  There was not much substance to the book for the price so therefore I will be returning the book to Amazon (alas this is the price you pay for buying a book when you cannot see the contents).  
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.   
 This is about the worst biography I've ever read. The author doesn't really know more about Soros than all of us who have read Soros's own books. All the materials used by the book seem to be second-handed.  What's more, when you read a book on Soros, it ought to be his investment stories that are most intriguing. This book, unfortunately, devotes a tiny coverage on Soros's investment life. Most of the book is on some mumble jumble stuff that nobody cares.  Lastly, the book isn't perticularly well written. Extremely boring.  
 I just completed this book yesterday and I must confess if it was any longer I might not have.  While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative.  The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life.  Many of the comparisons seem strained.  In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly.      It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious.  It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this?       The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill.  If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile.  If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last.  Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 I put off writing this review for a while, because I really love the Cake Doctor books, which are just fantastic, and didn't want to say anything that would hurt Ms. Byrn's feelings--she seems like a pretty cool chic.  This book, however, was a major disappointment.  I made several recipes from it and I'd say three out of four got two forks way, way down--my family did not like them at all.  The other reviewer that says she depends a lot on soup and cheese, half and half is accurate.  If I wanted such meals, I'd just zip on over to Cambells.com and save myself the cost of the book.  I didn't find anything in here that my family was glad to see again aside from the Ham-and-Cheese Impossible Pie, which I found out was pretty well known elsewhere.    This book also has some pretty odd recipes.  It's sort of like she stuck to her own family's favorites that didn't translate well into other family's taste--their appeal is not nearly broad enough to justify their being included.  Creole Shrimp with Polenta, Curried Chicken and Artichoke Casserole might be favorites in her home, but I assure you they aren't in mine.  My family didn't even care for her Tuna Casserole.  I would recommend buying a book from people who write about dinner--mainly "Fast. Cheap. Good." by the Desperation Dinners writer, which also includes your grocery budget to boot (with chapters like "How To Eat On $100 a Week", how can you go wrong?). Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross cook meals that have a tried and true broad appeal, as they have a nationally syndicated column called Desperation Dinners.  With all the feedback a national column generates, their substance is tried and true with a broad appeal to all.  As a frugal mom with a limited budget and limited space for books, I regret this purchase and wish I could return it.  Sorry, Anne.  Stick to cakes 
 There are a lot of books out there written purely for entertainment and then are the more scholarly, "artsy" books like "The Stone Diaries" that unless they get Oprah's endorsement usually aren't read in the mainstream.  These latter category of books have more freedom to experiment with different styles and techniques.  This can make for an interesting story or it can make for a dull, albeit somewhat thought-provoking read.  Again the latter categroy best describes "The Stone Diaries."  I hate to say a book is boring because I sound like a five-year-old trying to squirm his through an opera, but this book is BORING.  The problem lies with Daisy herself.  She isn't interesting.  She does nothing interesting.  Almost nothing interesting happens to her.  Her first husband for all of two weeks gets drunk and falls out a window; that's the most interesting thing that happens to her.  That and her birth in the kitchen of her father's Manitoba home when her mother was either too stupid or too lazy to find out she was pregnant.  Everything else is as common and ordinary and unexciting as the lint in your dryer.  She grows up, moves with her father to Indiana, goes to college, gets married and widowed, visits Ottawa, gets married again to the much-older man who helped raise her after her mother died, has three kids, gets widowed again, becomes a garden columnist, gets fired, gets depressed, gets old, gets sick, dies.  The end.  It almost sounds more interesting describing it that way than it reads in the book.  The most agonizing part for me is it takes the book so long to even get to Daisy.  The first 90 pages of the novel go by without knowing more than basic information about her.  We read nothing about her childhood except her getting sick and developing an allergy.  We read nothing about her teenage years in Indiana or her time in college.  We go through a good third of the book without knowing ANYTHING important about the main character of the story.  We're told plenty of background about the people around her--including the life story of her dead mother--but very little about her until she's already widowed the first time and on her way to becoming the Canadian June Cleaver.  The only way to appreciate this book, especially near the end, is to think, "Daisy is like me" or someone you know.  But then it's pretty depressing to think most of us are this bland and ordinary.  We'd like to think we're special but if we see ourselves in Daisy then we are anything but special.  The narration for this book was confusing as well.  It refers to Daisy in the 3rd person most of the time, but then throws in first-person references as well.  There's also a paragraph or two halfway through saying how unreliable Daisy is as a narrator.  Upon reading that, what am I the reader supposed to believe?  All of this as well as the frequent time shifts, cuts to letters, "theories", recipes, notes, and so forth left me dazed, confused, and feeling empty.  Of course you can say, "This won a Pulitzer, so what do you know?"  I've read many of the Pulitzer winners over the last 15 years or so and there aren't many I'd recommend reading unless you're a literary snob.  I'd theorize it's because most of these winners aren't written with the intent of entertaining readers.  All in all I think there might have been a way to make this uninteresting topic interesting, but Shields doesn't do enough to make that happen.  You're better served contemplating your own dull, empty life than reading someone else's.  To close, I'd like to point you to John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom books, starting with "Rabbit, Run" that chronicle a relatively ordinary person in a much more fascinating, entertaining way.  The last two books in the series even won Pulitzers.  There's a literary experiment that succeeded brilliantly 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 I ordered this item for our kids as a Christmas gift.  When it arrived, there was no chocolate in the box.  When I contacted Amazon to ask to have the chocolate shipped, they said they couldn't do that; the item needed to be returned and a new one would be shipped.  The second fountain arrived and still no chocolate.  I once again called Amazon and asked to have the chocolate shipped, but they cannot do that.  To their credit, they refunded the price of the fountain, but overall is was a hassle.  Would not order this item again 
 Having read the previous book by this duo about biblical archeology I looked forward to a good and interesting read.  I was hugely disappointed.  There was nothing new in this book: it seemed to be a re-hash of some of the material in the earlier book.  It may well be interesting to those who have not read the first book, but for me it was very tempting to put it down.  (However, I did read it through to the end. 
 I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers. And this customer will not be one next year 
 I tried to learn chess from Chess For Dummies. It was not written so even a dummy could understand things. It starts showing you stuff about how to play chess then suddenly you find a chapter in between that has nothing to do with what was covered before and leaves you lost and confused. How can a book like this be popular? Maybe because it is just part of a series of hundred of books that cover other subjects but just this one is aweful because the company did not know any better when putting it together. 
 This book was horrible, one: because these books don't interest me at all, and two: why does there have to be a whole novel on this topic when there cold just be a summary sheet. Basically this book is just not my cup of TEA..hahh 
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 Dont know whether the author had been too keen to show how good he wrote or to publish a new book or what, this book just lacked the substance to be useful on investment or trading. I doubt whether any reader of it can "understand how markets really work and win the wealth game" per book title by the very descriptive and insightless essays in unlinked chapters. I wonder why some referrals could praise it as an excellent Trading/Investment Psychology book. As a pro trader/CFA/trading book lover, I cant tell anything positive about it. So far I had rated less than five books of this category a one star as far as I remember, and this book is one of the minority. 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 Stopped working after one day! Show scrambled characters on the LCD. This scale was probably made for aliens since its reading is not legible to the human eye. Returned it. 
 The Namesake attempts to get the reader to the soul of the immigrant experience, but fails, as the book primarily focuses on the one-dimensional, shallow, superficial Gogol (who is American born), instead of spending a little bit more time on Ashima and Ashoke.  She also stereotypes all first generation immigrants as well as desis in India, as insecure, uncultured, bourgeouis.  The reality is quite different - while a large percent of Indians in India or first generation immigrants may not buy cheese from Pyrrenes or sip wine, there is a tremendous amount of art, music, literature in cosmopolitan India.   I almost got the sense, that this novel was a catarthic and semi-autobiographical release for Ms. Lahiri.  As a first generation immigrant, I can tell the reader to not base their idea of indians on what is potrayed by Ms. Lahiri in form of Ashima, Ashoke etc.   Finally, being a Manhattan elite with food, parties and drinks SHOULD NOT be the only definition of something all Americans are striving for.   She does not potray America or India in the vast multi-dimensional ways that these two great nations should be!  Other than that, interesting details of life in NYC and good, clean descriptive prose!  
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 Doubtless going to rattle a few cages here, on *both* sides: the people who consider his stuff impermissibly naughty, and the people who wax rhapsodic about this particular work.  But it has to be said.  Britain, the land that pioneered imprisonment without charge before we did, the land that criminalizes self-defense against burglars in your own home, is also the land without a First Amendment; and this has seemingly scared Mr. Hamilton into self-censoring and mutilating his own product.  This is a first-rank tragedy, as he is arguably the best-known and most highly respected photographer of this entire genre, and therefore the most likely to prevail in a frontal assault against the philistinism which equates nude photography with pornography.  Instead, however, he has in this volume essentially raised the white flag and abandoned *nude* photography in favor of topless photos which won't arouse the ire of the British police.  An astonishing number of his photos are awkwardly cropped for legal, rather than aesthetic reasons, so what was clearly shot as an integral figure study gets published as an amputated torso.  This phenomenon was *not* present in his early works, including his films and his photos for the Spanish edition of "Playboy"--it manifested itself only when the world got uniquely psychotic about "child pornography".  Even in the USA, where a 17-year-old Marine who carries a machine gun for a living can be considered a "child" if photographed wrongly, Sally Mann and Jock Sturges haven't thrown in the towel (or draped the model in it ;-).  Nor, of course has Bourboulon or Ionesco.  So I say:  Boycott!  The guy's got a right to protect his hide, of course, and even Galileo recanted when the Inquisition threatened to murder him for saying the Earth goes around the Sun.  But would you spend your money on a book that says it's the other way around? 
 Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd 
 Do you think jokes about a mom making her sons masticate by the pool is funnY?  No, I dont either!!  But this is all my friends play!!   For humor I prefer Woody Allen!1  Go seee Scoop with Scarlett!! 
 If you are interested in version 2.0 of hibernate, this book works well. If you, however, are interested in learning hibernate 3.0, you will struggle to get anything to work.  Examples: 1. code/ddl generation from mapping xml doesn't work without serious adjustment 2. the session.find command no longer exists (page 48) 3. session.delete(HQL) no longer exists (page 51)  For someone who is trying to learn hibernate, this manual has caused more headaches than it has solved 
 This pamphlet provides a very good high-level overview of the WBS concept, but the sparse content does justify the $25.00 price tag.  There are 58 half pages of text in this publication and it is a mere 1/4" thick. I was very disappointed when I opened the shipping box.  Before opening the shrinkwrap I surmised that I had received a CD version, but was surprised to find a very thin, very spartan publication.  The content, sans the intro, about the author, and index, would probably equal to ten back-to-back pages of information.  This publication clearly did not meet my expectations.  
 I got this thoughtful gift from someone who felt they were getting me a quality product since it is Cuisinart.   But, it is truly awful.  The worst thing is how loud it is. I'd like to know what the decibel level of this noise is because it is probably off the charts.  I'd probably use it more if it wasn't for this and the fact that it is really super heavy.  Cleaning it is like a workout for your upper arms.  And it doesn't clean up quickly.   Apart from this it works good but this for me is a major downside.  I wish it would break so I could justify purchasing a different blender 
 Not at all informative, this book seems to have taken its cue from Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" theory: the authors construct a model for the future U.S.-China confrontation that they almost  seem to hope will come about. Although nestled in scholarly language and  presented as the views of experts on China, most of the argument seems  based more on stereotypes and American paranoia than any actual fact. Also  annoying is the authors' assumption of the general benignity of U.S. policy  in Asia; it never occurs to them to question the designs of U.S.  policy-makers and businesses in the region.. 
 A snappy title and a great idea did not match up to the reality once listened to. The range of songs was odd - and most were rough - both in musicianship and lyrics. We listened to the CD once and I immediately regretted buying something based on great previews and accomplished artists who contributed to the tracks. Perhaps they were all drunk on rum when they came to the studio?! Don't bother buying this. 
 You guessed it: It's the same leftist b.s. we were all taught in school. Please, I'm already almost asleep...spare me these tired old lies 
 Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.  Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.  Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...  Very Very bad servic 
 These were horrible.  I thought I'd try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
 Not the product I was interested in.  Pathetic version of an actual good DVD.  Little information given which led me to believe it was the real thing 
 The credibility of this book has now been destroyed- see "Margaret Mead and Somoa" by Derek Freeman for proof- most serious academics now see this book as an emberassment, a bad joke perpetrated by an eager to please twenty three year old neophyte in the grip of ambition and groupthink.  A heady mixture indeed Ms. Mead.... The noble savage you say?  The malleability and innate goodness of human nature you say?  History now points an unwavering finger and pronounces you a liar.  What a shameful legacy. 
 I was pretty excited to read this book.  I found Rosamund to be a great read .  Until You was somewhat lacking but Phillipa takes the cake.  I found it to be boring from page 1.  I just couldn't get into it.  It was also very drawn out.  Ms. Small's earlier books had more steam to them.  I don't think this is true about her later books. Hopefully the 4th one in the series will be much better 
 This is a poor performance, poorly written and produced for a youthful audience. It is not adult fare 
 Although this catalogue is stunning in its photography, graphics and presentation, I was surprised and dismayed by its content. If the article in Chapter 6 entitled "Stumbles and Pitfalls in the Search of Viking  America" is an example of the level of scholarly rigor, the authors  have stumbled painfully with misrepresentations, unsubstantiated innuendos,  blatant contradictions and a stream of factual errors. The pitfall, it  seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest  consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the  Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue  (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research. In all, this  publication is an embarrassment to standards of American scholarship and a  perverse use of taxpayers' money. The Smithsonian should be ashamed of  itself!

 The Joss Stone of Snakes and Ladders is MIA. On this release she appears to be a background singer for a second rate rap group. There is NONE of the magic of her voice and lyrics from the Body and Soul CD 
 VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God.  This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere.  This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book.  Stick to the earlier stuff 
 I selected this book based on the awesome reviews.  It sounded like everything I needed to know about real estate investing, in a simplistic format.  Within a few chapters, I found the book to be very condescending (i.e.; Basically....if you're too stupid to understand this calculation, real estate investing is not for you).  Since I am a beginner and not a math major, I did not expect to whizz right through all of the calculations.  But I also did not expect a negative tone with no support that made me not want to read it further.  So, I bought REAL ESTATE INVESTING FOR DUMMIES.  I found it significantly more helpful.  It does point out warnings and says that if you're not comfortable with possible negative cash flow, then maybe real estate investing is not right for you at this time.  It also weighed the stability of real estate investing in comparison to stocks.  I found the Dummies book much better suited to the beginner while detailing pros and cons, instead of being a pain to read.  
 `The Anglo-American Establishment" is a book by Carroll Quigley, a man whom former president Clinton called his "favorite professor."    Quigley documents the work of a secret Group of influential conspirators, alleging that the Group was one of the most important historical facts of the 20th century, due to its influence on British foreign policy. The book covers the period from 1919-1945.   The author nearly bores us to death, and presents a lot of information that is contradicted by other sources.  There is some worthwhile information here, but it will be hard to find if your eyes glaze over.  Cecil Rhodes of South African fame formed this unnamed Group and perpetuated it after his death, by way of a trust fund.     Many who were associated with the Group imagined that they were endeavoring to extend British rule throughout the world, along with the great moral ideals of "freedom and democracy."    This Group was self-deluded.  They imagined that they were moral, civilized, and even Christian, but they were the antithesis of all that.  Their methods were those of tyrants, despots, warmongers, and conspirators.  Quigley makes a fundamental error in supposing that this Group was at the apex of power. More likely, this Group was manipulated to further the interests of international finance, without the idealists in the ranks having any suspicion of being used.      The name Robert Henry Brand (Baron Brand, Lord Brand) is repeatedly mentioned as a supremely influential member.  He was a partner and managing director of Lazard Brothers Bank.  "In all of his activities Brand has remained one of the most central figures in the core of the Group."     The Group was responsible for an unbroken series of British policy disasters.  Like they say, the big money is made in wars and depressions.     The Group's idea of expanding the British Empire mutated into the idea of placing the Commonwealth within a League of Nations, which is just another name for world government 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation.  The Good:  * Screen is bright, images look great * Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen.  * Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue.  The bad:  My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!    I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price.  Some details: * Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the "setup" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global * Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen. * Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this "feature" off. * The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change. * No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily  get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system. * Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 Up front, I'll admit that I do not own this DVD.  Reason:  I absolutely REFUSE to purchase a full-frame DVD, on top of that in a flimpsy cheap case that makes the edition reek of sub-standard.  When are the studios going to wake up to the fact that there is a growing number of movie buffs who want the WHOLE movie and not what some pan-and-scan technician decides we are allowed to see?    Until they decide to release this great little movie the way it's supposed to be seen, in W-I-D-E-Screen with a good sound track, forget it.  Thank you, previous reviewer, for pointing out the crumminess of the current release.  
 I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 Orson Scott Card has no idea how to teach writing.  His suggested techniques are not only difficult to apply to the actual writing of fiction, they are misinformed and contrary to basic principals of dramatic writing.  After reading this book, you might walk away with a mouthfull of cool sounding lingo.  You will now, however, write better 
 My 3 year old loves tractors, so he could watch this DVD all day. There is no way I could though! The music does not go with the movie at all. And I hate to say it, but if you were just listening, and not watching, you would think it was an adult film. Yeah, I know! The trucks are great, I just wish it had "truck" kind of music to go along with it 
 I knew something was amiss after ripping this to mp3 realizing it sounded EVEN WORSE, sounding way more degraded than the quality loss you'd expect from cd to mp3 transfer. If the decision to release these songs with poor sound quality was DELIBERATE then she's doubly failed; there is no added "warmth" or "ambience". This is a tragedy, because Orton has talent but it doesn't come through as I'd hoped on this album. I yawned several times during playback, it just isn't very good. These cuts would work better as throwaway, "alternate takes" or "rarities" - but as a bona fide career release? What she should have done is dump this production set and handed it over to William Orbit, who not only would have made these tracks infinitely more listenable, but you would actually HEAR them with proper EQ and mastering 
 This book has all the right things to make it a good novel. So why does The Raven only give it a measly two stars? Three words: Excessive language use. A character like John Constantine can be expected to use colorful language. Not a problem. In the real world, people express themselves in any number of colorful or off-color ways. But when the writer begins to add the words as part of the text, not conversation, I begin to wonder about the author's imagination. Isn't there a better way to say that without resorting to "gutter language?" The Raven thinks so. It is unrealistic to think that characters should not give way to full expression, it makes the character more human; you think: "Yeah, I know a bloke like that! Sounds just like him!" But in the context of the writing, it becomes: "Can't he think of another word? I'm tired of reading the f-word all the time!" Quoth the Raven.... 
 This book is a load of crap... and thats the nicest thing I can say about it.  I couldn't even stand to finish it, though I got most of the way through it.  Her statistics are all massively out of date (maybe the book is too, I don't remember) and the book is aimed at low level students.  If you're a barely-making-it-c-student who needs a boost, read this.  Otherwise, skip it.  The things she says about Ivy league schools (all the classes are huge and taught by graduate students with thick accents, etc) come off like she's presenting a conspiracy theory,  and I hardly count her as a credible source.  If you want to read a book dealing with about the same subject matter, read "Harvard Schmarvard." The guy who wrote it is a Harvard alum,  so I trust what he has to say slightly more than Pope.  He takes a much more objective- and sane- view about the whole thing, and comes off as much more trustworthy.  Pope completely puts down big schools, saying their wrong for everything, along with competitve and Ivy league schools.  Big schools are wrong for some, Ivy league schools are wrong for some, but the woman is crazy.  I read the library's copy, but I wouldn't advocate buying it.  Even used 
 The only reason I bought this soundtrack was for the version of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," sung by Rufus Wainwright. I couldn't find that version on another CD. Didn't care for the rest of the songs on this CD that much 
 The meta-story of this film was potentially interesting, but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable.   One star each for Cross and Black, whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie. Unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters, whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable, I would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching Melvin Goes to Dinner 
 I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album.  My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD.  AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable).  These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career.   The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool.  They've always been unique.  Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene.  Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, "Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band," at the beginning of the "He Who Laughs Last" video.  These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene.  When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae).  These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound.  Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity.  I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool).  Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD.  But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground.  AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.     
 This guy is totally out of touch with reality.  He is trying to rewrite reality so that the we give HIM power through the money he hopes we will spend on his book.  Don't make the mistake of buying this book and don't make the huge mistake of following what he writes.  There is no need for power in life.  Especially at our ages.  We need peace and happiness.  We can get this by a walk in the woods.  Don't loose the rest of your life by running after happiness where it is not.  Happiness is inside yourself, try to find it before looking elsewhere.  It will not come from anywhere or anybody else.  Get peace with yourself instead of creating chaos.    All chapters are poorly written with bad advices 
 Omie & Izzy are brother/sister kitties about 6 months old. They received this as a gift:  "It's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we don't play in it much on our own. One of the wires broke already and we've had it less than one month."  
 This David Bret should be a fiction Author. This was the biggest waste of money. Where were the wive's interveiws, old studio execs and his children when this pile of rubbish was being written? It is really easy to write of man who is gone over 40 years and make up as you go along. I worked at Warner Bros. for years and have followed Flynn's life to great extent. This garbage should have been pulled from the shelves long ago!!! 
 I don't think it's something you'd want to read for its own sake unless you have a particular interest in the development of the novel in in the nineteenth century. The plot concerns the efforts of Sir Austin Feverel to prevent his son's marriage and then to break it up. There are ponderous attemps at humor. A tragic and melodramatic ending is tacked on. The story is often difficult to follow, with characters being assigned different names. Jane Austen had already shown how a a tight light novel could be constructed. Madame Bovary had been written (for the diffference between mediocrity and genius compare the descriptions of the food at the wedding breakasts in this and in Madame Bovary). This has the clumsy baggy long-winded structure of Dickens (who was writing Great Expectations at the sme time) but without the great characters and confrontations. This was popular literature in its time, and considered scandalous 
 I thought that I ordered the textbook and got a type of study guide instead.  The title of the textbook and the title of the 'studyguide' CANNOT be the same on Amazon - that is where I made my mistake!! 
 The claims made in this book sound great, until you look at the other side of the Laetrile (a.k.a. B17) story.     I just can't find a CREDIBLE source that endorses Laetrile. According to the book that's because the Feds are out to get 'em. All mainstream Oncologists (or any M.D. for that matter) are part of a vast conspiracy fueled by greed and thinly veiled homicidal tendencies. (I should add suicidal to the list since DOCTORS DIE FROM CANCER TOO.)      We all need something to believe in when life stops being wonderful and gets tough, scary and incredibly unfair. When your sick and the best treatments available bring only a marginal chance of survival (sometimes leaving you with missing parts) it's only natural to become desperate and scour every resource you've got for a better way.  THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE PERFECT 'MARK' FOR CON-MEN/QUACKS!      If you're still curious go ahead and read the book, but don't stop there.  Look at all sides to every story when considering treatment options, it's not like you have to believe every point of view you're exposed to.   Go to the watchdog sites and look up Laetrile/B17. Checkout the wrap sheet of the individuals marketing this stuff, cross reference your search and look at what other miracles they market. Ask yourself...   ·	Do the articles and testimonials for these different products seem to be a form letter.  ·	How do they find the time to become experts in virtually every field of medical science and discover a cure for EVERY major disease known to man? ·	Are they really a doctor? Did the school they earned their diploma from have authority to grant doctoral degrees in that field? ·	What is the success rate and where are the reports to prove it? If there are no records, how could they be so stupid? (Our brightest minds have been toiling for decades and they have records of every tiny success and huge failure.) ·	There are dozens products for every bodily function known to man on the shelves of vitamin shops. They are there legally even though most are not proven or doubted by the mainstream medical community. Why is B17 allegedly singled out? ·	Keep in mind that alternative therapies that WORK (i.e. Acupuncture) ARE being more widely accepted everyday.   ·	Many Quacks claim that their cure has been widely used in some far off land for ages and everyone there agrees it's saved numerous lives. THE WEB IS WORLD WIDE! Check it out! Are Australians being cured without a doubt or has their government just not gotten around to banning the product yet?  Making an informed decision is a lot of work, but it's a worthy investment of time if it prevents you from trading your life for a lie.  
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 It worked right from the get go as far as recording my VHS tape, very easy to figure out. And I had no problems with formatting my DVD (I used Windata DVD-R) or recording.  What I DID have a problem with is that the final result drops frames, resulting in a jerky stop-motion look.  Also, there is no way to tell how much time you have left to record until it just suddenly stops recording.  Seems to me a DVD should hold at least two hours, but it only held about an hour and a half.  I was really excited at first when it seemed like it would work perfectly, and then so disappointed with the poor results and the inadequate information needed for stress-free recording 
 Yes my friends, it's time to review yet another one of Roger Corman's Comedy Classics. The 1978 film "Deathsport" arose from two significant incidents. One, the box office success of George Lucas's "Star Wars" virtually ensured that Corman would attempt to capitalize on that film's success. Two, Rog needed product to follow up on his "Death Race 2000" flick. Retaining the services of David Carradine and throwing in sound effects lifted directly from "Star Wars," Corman must have thought "Deathsport" would rake in millions. There's just one problem, however. "Deathsport" is an awful film. It's poorly scripted, cheesily acted, suffers from cheap production sets and lousy props, and generally runs about seventy-five minutes longer than its eighty-two minute runtime requires. I've seen many Roger Corman films thanks to the miracle of DVD technology, and have even enjoyed more than a few of them. For instance, I think "Humanoids From the Deep" is a massively entertaining movie. But "Deathsport" is in a category all its own. It's easily one of Corman's worst efforts. If you're familiar with his particular brand of low-grade sludge, you know that's saying a lot. When he misses, he misses big time. "Deathsport" is a huge miss.  The opening scenes of the film tell us that what we are about to see takes place in the future, 1000 years after an even called the Neutron Wars decimated humanity. Umm, o.k. Why not? It could happen. Then we see Carradine loping through rugged landscape clad in a cloak, a loincloth, and a few stock post-apocalyptic accoutrements. He's Kaz Oshay, a member of a rabidly individualistic sect possessing mental abilities and a tendency to speak dialogue that sounds like it came from a box of fortune cookies called the Range Guides. An evil dude by the name of Ankar Moor (Richard Lynch) sits nearby on a mountaintop, watching our hero through a scope while issuing frantic ambush orders to a bunch of hapless foot soldiers. Moor wants to capture Carradine's character at the behest of the evil Lord Zirpola (David McLean), a tyrant who rules over Helix City, so that the people in the city can watch Oshay die painfully in a spectator called...wait for it...DEATHSPORT! Predictably, Oshay falls into the hands of Moor and soon learns of a plot to wipe out as many Range Guides as possible. He teams up with one of them, Deneer (Claudia Jennings), to bring down the hegemony of Zirpola and Ankar Moor.  Along the way we're treated to one ham-fisted scene after another. Geez, where to start? How about with Ankar Moor's obvious comparisons to Darth Vader. He dresses in black, was once a Range Guide himself, and now works for an evil emperor...I mean Lord. Then there's the Deathsport itself. Set in a huge coliseum surrounded by cheering crowds--it's all created with canned sound effects and large paintings--the actual game is so lame I hesitate to describe it. Contestants drive fearsome death machines that shoot lasers that vaporize their enemies. Sounds great, doesn't it? It is until you realize these "death machines" are simply dirt bikes covered in molded plastic. Moreover, all they do is drive around popping wheelies and jumping over dirt ramps. Oshay and Deneer compete by running around this dirt obstacle course knocking the bad guys off the bikes, which then explode with big blooming fireballs. We even see one of the riders stumbling around on fire in slow motion. The subsequent escape, and thus the rest of the film, consists of endless chase scenes, explosions, and dialogue so dumb it'll lower your IQ score by fifty points. Will Oshay battle Ankar Moor in the end? Who will win? Who cares?  Whew. You'd have to check out "The Shape of Things to Come" or any of the Italian post-apocalyptic actioners to find a movie that compares with the mind-numbing banality of "Deathsport." Every actor associated with this boilerplate ought to have his or her SAG card seized and burned. It's been awhile since I've seen a film fail on so many levels. Ripping off sound effects and plot points from "Star Wars" is only the tip of the iceberg. Witness, for example, the over the top shenanigans from David McLean as Lord Zirpola. The actor who plays the character, David McLean, looks like a low rent Vic Morrow. His performance consists of threatening underlings when he's not clutching his head and roaring in pain from the "radiation poisoning" that's threatening his sanity. Then there is Claudia Jennings's sultry dance in her birthday suit. O.k., I really liked that part, but I couldn't help suppress a chuckle and a groan when I noticed that her dance was part of a torture devised by Lord Zirpola. The method of torture, you ask? Deneer must sashay through a bunch of dangling Christmas lights encased in plastic. When Zirpola flicks a switch, they cause immense pain. At least that's what I gathered from the ominous music and sound effects. Speaking of the music, the score consists of random synth noises slapped together. It's utter garbage.  Extras on the disc consist of trailers for "Big Bad Mama," "The Capitol Conspiracy," "Knocking on Death's Door," and "Death Race 2000." There's also a talk that lasts for roughly five seconds, long enough for David Carradine to punch out an interviewer who has the temerity to mention the word "Deathsport" to him. I'm kidding. There is no interview, but one could imagine such an incident occurring since the film is so incredibly awful. Still, I'm going to give the movie two stars because of the lovely Jennings and because I can't get enough of these terrible post-apocalyptic flicks. Avoid "Deathsport" like the plague unless you have similar interests.  
 I must have really funky shaped ears because the right ear is just about perfect and the left is just painful. Add to this the fact that the cord is about 13 inches long (exaggeration) and this set is a bad deal 
 I find this author very simplistic.  It seems it would be good for a young reader: simple language and not too challenging.  For adults?  I'd think adults would get impatient with the overly simple writing.  I'm a big mystery fan, and tried a couple of her DoD series, but they're SO immature. Geeze, Encyclopedia Brown is more complex 
 The book offers good introduction to Flex 2 and includes many tips as well.  But the big problem for this books is the writing style.  The examples are usually modified/enhanced examples from previous chapters.  But the authors relentlessly go through each line changes with a huge paragraph; it often looks something like "remove this line, add this component, and save".  A usual half page worth of content is bloated to 3, 4 pages of tedious step-by-step instructions.  I personally would prefer to see the code changes between 2 versions directly, something like a side-by-side code snippet comparison would do the trick 
 Berger is anything but readable.  To start with, any given sentence in the book contains anywhere from one to five neologisms the author himself has spawned (most likely in a laughable attempt at clarity).  Sentences like "the nominizing act intends a comprehensive order of all items that may be linguistically objectivated, that is, intends a totalizing nomos", is among one of thousands of obscure artifacts of Berger's logic-gears that serve to make this book, in three simple words, *anything* but readable.  I award it five stars for containing excellent ideas, and subtract four for managing to render them virtually indecipherable 
 An excellent book for the same pretentious, self-congratulatory grown-ups who give themselves little kisses of self regard for their Channel 13 memberships and who shiver with uncontrollable pleasure at the very mention of "culture," or "art." Children, however, will be, as mine was, and I was, bored.  My child is too young to also have been repelled by Tony Kushner's fake, artsy-fartsy poeticisms that make reading the book out loud a tedius struggle, though he was not too young to have wondered, as I did, if an actual STORY was going to begin at some point. A good reliable general rule of thumb, especially where children's books are concerned, is that when critics fling about raves involving high school lit terms like "allegory" the cautious reader without a lot of loose pocket change will walk on by.  THE WILD THINGS, for eg, is a great book that hasn't got much of a story story, but that has a LOGIC and a story type rythym and language that doesn't try to force the ball out of the park 
 yea so like i'm sure the product would work if i had HD components but my problem was i bought it for my hd tv that only has one regular av input and like 3 HD inputs so i needed 2 or 3 devices with regular plugs( 1 plug for video 2 for audio ) so now it sits all silly looking on my entertainment center while i wait for the correct type of a/v switcher to show u 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts 
 This book is superficial, gossipy with little insight other than ain't folk strange. Try Love's Executioner by Irvin Yalom for contrast  with ease and pleasure of readin 
 I read this a few years ago and it was terrible.  The book in general is not very well written and I had to push myself to finish it. Every so often the book veers away from the plot so the preachy heroine can go on a goody goody witch rant.  She's so annoying, I wanted to reach in the book and slap her.   When I did finish it, instead of giving it away or keeping it-I threw it in the trash. 
 I expropriated this book from the Princeton History Department, where it was forlornly residing underneath a "Free To Anyone" sign. I got what I paid for. It's crap, and babble, and everything else that uniformly applies to anything written by a deconstructionist, structuralist, or similar academic mountebank. If you come across a copy, skim it for laughs. (Trust me: you won't have to get past the Introduction to find some uproariously awful sentences. 
 After reading this book, I still haven't decided whether the author is a genius or a nutcase.   Most of the main characters ultimately die a particularly useless and gruesome death, and the book never seems to arrive at a particular point.  Even the prologue drags on endlessly. 
 The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review.  As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples.  What an awful book 
 Plugged it into my wife's car. Set it, listened to 1/2 of a song, then went to remove it to try it in my car. The plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter, leaving part of the plug in the jack. Returned it, Satechi sent my refund quickly 
 One of the other reviews commented how this disc had no surface noise?  Well, they're right.  The noise reduction (sounds like an older analog process) removed enough of the upper frequencies that the label chose to add echo after the fact to cover up their handiwork.  So, "Blue River" is a brilliant performance . . . but it appears here in mediocre sound.  For my money, the best sounding set out there NOT on Mosaic is the 2-cd 'Jazz Tribune Vol 48' on RCA (a US release). There is a WORSE sounding Beiderbecke cd out there, with Orrin Keepnews' name on it yet.  BUT . . . that's another story 
 I haven't read the book but I am about to buy it so this isn't a review it's just a comment on the other reviews.  I don't know exactly how the writing linked Taoism and Ninjutsu as I haven't read the book. I just wanted to say this isn't the first time I have heard of this.   It was in one of either of these two books I can't remember which (I would bet on the first):  Mind Manipulation The Ninja - Steven Hayes  They discuss the development of alot of the psychoogical aspects from the Taoist 5 elements and there was a reference to some "5 element ninjas." There was even a Japanese word for them.  I remember this clearly coz at the time I was doing XIng Yi Luihe a Taoist art with the 5 elements at its heart. Also the 5 element ninja idea sounded cool.  I am not concluding anything...just offering a bit of info in passing.  PS. My rating was just to try and not mess up the rating by others. 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
  At first I was real happy with this, but when I opened the case and started using it I realized how tiny this was. I could hardly fit my USB cable into it's pouch and if you put the ipod in the case that it came with and then into the travel case, it wouldn't really fit. The hole thing started falling apart after a few days and my ipod wouldn't stop falling out of the little lether so it got scatched alot. It's not really worth $30 to me. I suggest you do not buy it. 
 I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas. 
 After this percolator stopped working, we were instructed to send it to Dulalit's service center for repair (Electra Craft, Inc.)  Customer service at the repair center was very unprofessional -- they would tell us the package was shipping out to us, and nothing would arrive.  It was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition.  It took them four months to return the percolator to us.  They refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund.    We unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one, I had to contact Electra Craft, again.  They were able to provide the part, a simple stainless steel lid, for $25.00 plus shipping and handling!  I'm sure their other replacement parts are overpriced as well 
   This particular edition of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" is a bare literal translation prefaced by a rather wordy introduction that pads the book up to a total of 96 pages.  While the translation is not bad, the book contains no explanations or notes to enlighten the readers on some of the more obscure points, such as the modern equivalents of ancient Chinese distance measures.   The one sentence review, pronouncing this to be the best translation, was perhaps a bit generous.  Among both military and history buffs, the prevailing view is that the translation by Lionel Giles, of the British Museum, is the definitive translation.  Of the various available editions of the Giles translation, the Special Edition that contains two complete copies of the English text - one with and one without extensive notes and commentary - in addition to the complete text in Chinese characters - is far and away the best.  The $4.95 price for this book (or for the matchbox size miniature edition from Running Press) is a bargain only for those who are more concerned with price than with value.  Choosing a better edition of "The Art of War", rather than this rather skimpy edition, will be money well spent.  It is far better to own a book you can be proud of and which does a better job of informing you than this merely passable edition.  
 This CD is decent at best. I give it 2 stars just based on the  3 songs (Palmetto Park, Samba, Via Nueve). They sound great and soothing, but everything else is mediocre. It is just uninspired. The 2 major flaws with the CD are Vince Gill singing, and the uneven solo time Russ takes over David. I love piano a lot more than classical guitar, and it seems Russ always takes 2 solos to David's 1. He is not the best guitarist in the world (all riffs sound the same from this guy) and David is much more technically proficient (classically trained pianist) in my opinion. Also, there are too many vocal tracks on today's smooth jazz CD's, and the vocal tracks always SUCK (excluding Fourplay, Norman Connors and Pat Metheny Group). If I want to hear singing, I'll buy Norah Jones, Al Jarreau, Diana Krall, and other VOCALISTS. One more thing, Trumpet is not the best smooth jazz instrument, so why the hell is Chris Botti on everything? I also play trumpet and would like to keep it in traditional jazz or classical music 
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 Do not read this book! It has useless and stupid information. The very little important information would be common since to most people who have ever gone to school. I strongly recommend that you don't read this book. I'm a christian and I still do not think it is a good christian book. If you like coffee, cokes, tv, music, etc. then you shouldn't read this book. It will tell you that it is wrong for you do these things. Please do not read this book! 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:  1.) Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.  Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them.  Just a mess.  2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone.  Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.  3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself.  I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously.  Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.  I guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.  For me, I've decided to get one of those Vollcraft units.  It's on order 
 More a political history than a technical one, and not very engaging. I agree, though, that the research is broad 
 I was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. It isn't really, and there isn't really that much to this magazine.  It is just another tired old AOLTimeWarner publication, just like Time, People, or Teen People.  I looked at the August and September issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on Elton John's Out of Africa fundraiser and the article on Julian McMahon.  The rest of it was ads, and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in Vogue magazine, but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else, and they are annoying.  There were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of Kelly Ripa (post excessive Photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it "plastic person syndrome") Mark Consuelos, waay too much on Jennifer Garner and her baby, and other weird things, such as the trend of designer cupcakes.  I wish I was kidding on the latter, but I am not, nor do I have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is Jessica Alba's favorite.  There was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here.  Despite the size of this magazine, there is very little to sink ones teeth into, just way too many photos of the same old same old, and tips for mimicking them.  I am NOT interested in becoming a Teri Hatcher clone, nor am I interested in seeing Vanessa Carlton's pad.  This magazine is for you if you like excessive ads, no diversity, a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in New York because some celebrity did.  This magazine is mediocre at best, and the worst part is, it has the exact same fashion advice as Vogue.  I went with Vogue because there is substance in their magazine, and the ads are classy and very chic.  Leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at AOL Time Warner.  
 I realize that the Stephanie Plum series is primarily written for women and I can appreciate that. Even though I am a guy I had really enjoyed the books until this one. First of all, I grew very tired of all the misadventures. I know that is the charm of her character but I think she averaged 3 strange encounters a day. It just wasn't very realistic. Also, the ending was terrible. If Ranger was going to take care of her business anyway, why did he let her waste all that time? Lastly, is there going to be a point when Stephanie actually becomes semi-independent and competent. I am starting to lose the love for Ms. Plum 
 I agree with the reviews below: this is a fabulous collection of verb paradigms for both learning and reference. But a significant flaw is that neither the word stress nor the quality of the stressed vowels are indicated.   The stress on the present tense of italian verbs (and some infinitives) is not predictable from its orthorgraphy and it may appear on either the penult or the antepenult of a verb. Such information is necessary in order for a learner to acquire a correct pronunciation, and it is missing in this book.  Moreover, a stressed "e" or "o" may be pronounced either open or close in Italian verbs in the present tense and in some irregular past-tense and past-participle forms; but in this book, there is no indiction of a preferred pronunciation. Such information would be of great intrest to a learner who wanted to develop a native-like accent.   In order to find information regarding verb stress and vowel quality, a learner would need to consult a second dictionary.   As an alternative, I would recommend, at least for starters, the trade paperback called "200 Italian Verbs" by Barnes and Nobel. Although it is limited to 200 verbs, the stress is conveniently indicated by an acute accent on verbs with close "e" and "o" and by a grave accent on verbs with open "e" and "o". This publication is out of print but still available on line for under five dollars from used-book sellers.   
 There is so much content that is erroneous and problematic in this DVD it is almost impossible to know where to begin.  The basic premises which are presented throughout this DVD are reconstructionist and revisionist history. The implication that is portrayed here is that all of history (especially that which pertains to Christianity) that we were taught and all of history that has been presented textually is wrong. However, the implication furthers itself in the presentation of this DVD that what is here (in this DVD) is correct and should be taken seriously if one is to have a more enlightened view of history. If you don't believe me then simply watch the DVD and see for yourself.  The majority of the authors interviewed in this DVD have written books that have absolutely no historical evidence which would substantiate their claims (with the exception of Dr. Robinson, but even some of his claims were fanatically out in left field on occasion). The only author who was actually willing and honest enough to admit this was Henry Lincoln (one of the authors of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail.') On several occasions Lincoln admitted that what is being presented here is purely speculation and should not be take too seriously. But ideas have consequences and it is apparently taken very seriously by those presenting it in this DVD.  This DVD is shot through with unsubstantiated claims that are presented as if they are incontrovertible fact. This is deceptive at best for the viewer. Anyone who would actually take a little time to probe into these claims, looking at credible and respected researchers and scholars, would see this to be the case.  The most interesting feature of this DVD is the interview (in the extra features) with Dr. James Robinson about the Nag Hammadi documents. This sections gives a nice historical background explanation of how these documents where found, who found them, where they were found, and what happened to them after they were found. However, as this interview moves forward and shifts into different subject matters, there arises several problems in Dr. Robinson's assertions and the overall interview begins to take on a certain 'agenda' (for lack of a better term) that fits the tone of the film. However, I did enjoy his interview (and for this I give the DVD 2 stars).  Overall, this DVD I believe, is more harmful than helpful. It shows a serious breakdown in credible historical research, and the methods behind credible scholarly historical research. The DVD demonstrates that speculation is more solid than actual proven fact - which is simply absurd. It is filled with unsubstantiated claims that are presented as if they are 'proven' fact (proven only by assertion and no evidence other than assertion). This, as I stated earlier, is just pure historical deception.  For a good counter to this DVD and its claims I would recommend "The Da Vinci Hoax" by Carl E. Olson and Sandra Mielsel 
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 Am I the only one that is not rating this CD more stars?  I was VERY disappointed in this CD.  Too much talking by Ms. Cook took away from the whole recording.  I must admit that I was unaware that it was a Concert Recording. Another disappointment was that it had no orchestra. Had I known that I would not have purchased it!  She is still in fine voice and I will remain a fan of hers.  Too bad this CD is a bummer 
 "The Third Millennium" can only be described as a monumental event in the annals of crud.  On a literary level, this puppy manages to be even worse than the Left Behind books.  As "Left Behind" was one of the most purely awful bricks ever foisted on the book-buying public, that's no mean feat, but undeniably Paul Meier has accomplished it.  All I can say is that "The Third Millennium" is the worst children's book I've ever read.  I label it a children's book precisely because it's written for children.  Characters are cardboard, personalities are told rather than shown, and nearly identical sentences are repeated over and over.  Reading Meier is like reading stories by fifth graders; he knows the rules of the English language but can't grasp how to write effective sentences:  "Even though he congratulated himself on being an avant-garde psychiatrist, Larry couldn't supress a conservatism that more than occasionally popped out.  His religious Jewsih ancestors had made their indelible mark, which was reflected in the white trim on his gray house.  Knowing that he could close the shutters anytime he liked similarly comforted him."  (How many times did you have to read that final sentence before you understood it?)  "The Third Millennium" follows the standard formula of Christian potboilers.  A middle class family is minding its own business when suddenly neighbors get raptured, Israel is attacked for no reason, and the United States renames itself "the New Roman Empire".  The President does suspiciously anti-Christian things, such as defending the right to privacy and balancing the federal budget.  He also announces a plan to implant credit card numbers in everyone's right hand, and invites people to share their comments by dialing 1-800-666-6666.  (No, I'm not making this stuff up.)  Of course there are long chapters of folks reading the Bible and no shortage of instantaneous conversion scenes worthy of Chick tracts.  For the most part, however, the main characters do nothing but sit around watching TV until almost the end of the book.  Continuity also slips.  Leading man Larry Feinberg is first described as a psychiatrist but later as a physician.  His son Ben starts out as a medical student but later we're told that he's a math major.  Ben's girlfriend Cindy is supposedly blind, but that doesn't stop her from seeing a hippy-like classmate who turns out to be an angel.  Of course complaints like these miss the point, as even fans of "The Third Millennium" admit that the writing is pretty nasty.  The appeal lies in the supposed fact that this stuff is all biblically kosher and will be coming true any minute now.  In fact Meier tacks on an Acknowledgment section where he congratulates himself for his "compulsive quest for accuracy and feasibility".  Hmmm, let's see here.  Meier has Jews performing animal sacrifices in Jerusalem, apparently unaware that even the Orthodox halted ritual sacrifice centuries ago.  He mentions "the ancient Muslim Empire of Babylon"; Babylon came and went thousands of years before the founding of Islam.  One character claims that Hitler started the extermination of the Jews on 1942 on Av 9 (Av is a month in the Jewish calendar).  Unfortunately for him, the Holocaust actually started years earlier, in 1939.  Then there's the prophecies.  Practically half the book is devoted to having a dude named Jimmy lecture us on how many biblical prophecies have come true.  (The fact that Jimmy is a used car salesman, a profession not known for honesty, makes this unintentionally apt.)  Debunking every claim in the book would frankly tax my patience and exceed amazon's 1,000 word limit, but I'll give a small sample.  Consider this from page 79:  "Turn to Ezekiel 4:4-6 and note what God had the prophet do.  He lay on his side for 430 days to signify that Israel would be in another exile for 430 years. ... Because of their lack of repentance, their punishment was multiplied sevenfold, as Moses had warned it would be in the Torah in Leviticus 26.  Sounds strange until you add it to 536 B.C.  I'm going to translate this into the modern calendar.  Anybody recognize the significance of this date?  May 14, 1948, the date modern Israel was founded."  Let's see here.  The number of years between 536 B.C. and 1948 A.D. is 536+1948=2484.  On the other hand, a 430 year punishment multiplied by seven is 7*430=2910.  Now I think 2484 is not the same number as 2910, unless conservatives have decided to replace math with 'intelligent arithmetic'.  I would submit that most of Meier's other claims fall apart in a similar manner.  To give credit where credit is due, Meier's predictions are not totally off the mark.  Describing the President of the United States, he says the following: "There were no restraints on his pursuit of his own ends."  If that doesn't perfectly capture the attitude of our current chief executive, I don't know what does.  Other than that, however, Meier's attempt to fortell the future seems to have hit a bum steer.  How it is that garbage like this hogs the spotlight while great Christian authors such as R. A. Lafferty and Gene Wolfe languish in obscurity, I don't know 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 The book, while written fairly well, doesn't have enough to keep the reader interested.  I was more entertained by Flags of Our Fathers and Indestructible, Jack Lucas, Medal of Honor. Though any hero's story deserves to be told. 
 Lets be for real. What is good charlotte doing? Making a bad name for Punk. Whenever I tell Some one i like Punk, I have to hear....oh you like that good charlotte, you like that blink 182. NO I dont I listen to real punk, Bands Like the dead Kennedy's.  But it's not only punk being destroyed, other genras are too.   Just look at hip hop. I listen to real, talented hip hop groups or rappers such as public enemy, Big L, Rakim, Wu tang, but If I tell some one i like it i have to hear... Oh you like 50 cent, you like mike jones ect ect.  What you have to do is get this pop mtv crap outta hear. No matter what genra it is....MTV has a fake commercial side to destroy it.  Matter of fact, a real punk band wouldnt be all over MTV, they wouldn't have a corny gimmic of wearing piercings all over them, or running around naked (blink 182).  BOYCOTT ALL THIS POP GARBAGE, wheather it's pop-hip hop, pop-punk, pop-rock, whatever.  Good Charlotte is the same type of music as 50 cent. THEY ARE BOTH POP. end of story 
 This book is horribly outdated!  If you have Acrobat 5, - fine. Or maybe not so fine... use the money you would have spent on this book and upgrade to the current Adobe version: Acrobat 7 as of Sept 2006. ..and beware of Wiley Books that don't specifiy the application version - -  Wiley is notorious for this -- remember, when purchasing a Wiley book -- think twice if the version of the application is not specified. 
 I feel like maybe I missed something, given all the hype that surrounded this book. But I found that it didn't seem to add much to the subject matter: it seemed like a rather weak summary of the explorers journals. I keep feeling like I would have been better reading the primary source material or a different survey of that material. I like Ambrose's other works and am a avid history reader, but this one really feel short. The subject matter may simply not as suited to Ambrose's style. Someone like Robert Kaplan (Balkan Ghosts), Rebecca West (Black Lamb and Grey Falcon) or William Dalrymple (From the Holy Mountain) would have done a much better job of weaving in what Lewis and Clark were seeing and experiencing within the context of their times and pulled in additional material to illuminate the subject matter. 
 This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype.  Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario.  But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device 
 Any book based on the premise that the Rosenbergs were innocent, deserving of beatification, victims of awful America, is not going to date well.  1977, I suppose, was a kind of high-water mark for that sort of thinking.  If you have a friend who thinks Stalin was unfairly maligned, this may be the book for him.  I was forced to read this book cover to cover by a vindictive college professor who assigned it to me (and me alone) as the subject for a class writing project.  I loathed every minute of it.    From its doctrinaire anti-anti-communist, anti-Americanism; its sub-Dos Passos modernism; its sophomoric delight in scatology (giggle, giggle, tee hee, Nixon has sex with Ethel Rosenberg and is then anally raped by Uncle Sam).  There are no fully-formed characters, just endless making of puerile political points.  Nixon-bad.  Time Magazine-bad.  America-bad.  Ethel Rosenberg-saint and martyr.    Its like a bad book treatment of a very bad Ken Russell movie.  I'd rather eat jagged metal bits than be forced to read this pompous, train-wreck of a book ever again 
 Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
 sound is fine for Ipod music. The radio stations do not come in. One local station tunes to all.  Our $20 Boom box gets better reception 
 Writers like Arundhati Roy love to write about conflicts.... the left in general loves the idea of a class struggle... because that is how the society in the West was for many years and still is in certain ways.. India has never been about that.. what one sees in India at every turn is reconciliation.. the amazingly accommodating nature of India enabling us to accept people from all religions, from all backgrounds etc. I believe that the essential nature of India is love... sadly, very few people recognize this and this book is the result.. shallow and abusive... We no longer seem to have the awe and respect for beauty and greatness... the "everyone and everything is equal" philosophy has destroyed our understanding of the world.  As Adi Shankara says, we are all equal but only when our mind evolves to the stage where we can conceive of the world in that fashion.  A materialistic loony who has plastic surgery every six months is not equal to Adi Shankara no matter what anyone might say.  As they say in my hometown,  Kahan Raja Bhoj, Kahan Gangoo Telli 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 I bought this book based on the reviews here and the fact that it had an introduction by Lon Milo Duquette--I just finished reading his wonderful "My Life With the Spirits." But if this book's content reflects the new hermetics, then the new hermetics is a superficial mishmash.  First, the system is a rehash of Golden Dawn with NLP and Leary painfully grafted on. The first thing I wanted to know was why this combination is particularly worthwhile, but the argument for this combination seems to rest on the author's claims that NLP and Leary are "cutting edge." Well, they aren't cutting edge, but even if they were, why would what is cutting edge be especially helpful in hermetics, new or otherwise? Just because something is new does not make it good. This assumption, though, permeates the book.  There is not much depth. For instance, certain parts of the book contain large crude illustrations of well known GD rituals like the Middle Pillar, apparently to take up space. Whole tables that reiterate widely available GD information are reproduced.  But worse are the numerous sweeping statements that are completely incorrect, such as "Your brain does not differentiate between thoughts and things, because thoughts are things." Or how about "Eastern thought tends to be transcendental, ephemeral, and often insubstantial." One wonders if the author even knows what these words mean or just used them because they sounded important (which would fit with the superficiality here). Or the author's statements that alchemy is an exclusively Western practice or that Satanists can't exist without evangelical Christians, etc., etc. Every page offers a selection of truly ignorant remarks.  This book is a good example of the kind of superficial familiarity with belief systems, breezy arrogance, and just plain laziness that is frequently passed off as knowledge in the occult world, and that is why I titled this little review "Embarassing."  The book is founded on the mistaken notion that there is in fact a free lunch.   This is one of the few books I've read that I would like to get my money back for. The only reason I did not give it one star is because they caught most of the typos and it has a nice cover 
 Mark Bittman's "How to Cook Everything" is a treasure trove of vegeterian recipes, including tons of recipes for cooking legumes, grains, and vegetables. Unfortunately, those sections are all missing from "The Minimalist Cooks Dinner," which is essentially about cooking meat, poultry, and fish. Vegeterian Bittman fans would be better off sticking with "How to Cook Everything" and/or trying out "The Minimalist Cooks Vegetarian.&quot 
 Clever marketing ploy, calling this the last novel written by an author, supposedly a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815, portrayed in the ABC series LOST. There are even LOST references sprinkled throughout the book - Hanso, Mr. Cluck's, John Locke, Oceanic. Unfortunately, it's the only clever aspect to this book. It's a wholly sophomoric effort in the private dick genre.  PI Paul Artisan is hired by a rich man to find the man's identical twin, the supposed "bad" twin of the title. For a novel this short, Artisan spends an enormous amount of time thinking screamingly inappropriate thoughts about women he meets along the way - some simply in passing - including bedding the rich man's stepmother and a hippie yoga instructor named Sky. About half-way through the story, Paul makes some high-handed comment that he's not doing to the job just for money anymore. This statement comes completely out of the blue. I didn't find his thoughts or his actions backing this up.  The author has the annoying habit of repeatedly referring to the protagonist by his full name. Really not necessary, since they're the first two words of the book. Paul has a mentor with whom he discusses the case, a former college instructor named Manny, with whom he shares custody of an aging, but young-at-heart Labrador named Argos. Manny has a knack for making his point by referring to classics like Lord of the Flies and King Lear. References which, invariably, Paul never gets, and Manny has to explain.  Frankly, I would have rather read a book about the dog 
 I cannot fully express how disappointed I was after reading this massive report on complexity foundations.  The pre-release hype would have one believing that Wolfram was the next Newton or Einstein, with this book describing some paradigm-shifting new observation about science and our universe.  Unfortunately, the only one who seems to believe that this work is brilliant is Wolfram himself, whose self-congratulatory accolades color the text throughout the book.  So okay Mr. Wolfram.  I got it.  You believe you are supremely brilliant and anyone who doesn't agree is supremely dense.  But really, the observations in this books are almost self-evident at a level of "duh!" as rendered by a surly Napoleon Dynamite, "Gosh, everyone knows that!"  So, if you've got the stomach to sit through hundreds of pages of redundant charts, graphs and text... and if you can handle a massive missive of self-absorbtive congratulations, then go ahead and see if you can discover "A New Kind Of Science."  All I found was the old kind of self-delusion.   
 (i am not a native speaker, please overlook my style) i am not going to review the novel, i simply love it. this edition was quite a disappointment to me: the box and the over book-cover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite; the book cover and the binding are rather of a poor quality but still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this 
 This is a disappointing release and offers little that is new to the dedicated collector, even "When Lights Are Low" has had a previous CD release in Japan on Sony CSCS 5242 - we really need a release of the albums not on CD ! 
 I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 Meh, I had high hopes for this book, I really did.  Some of the projects are really interesting, but as it's been pointed out many times before the whole thing is just a book of plans from his website. Every single project requires at least one (often many more) special part that can only be order for an arm and a leg. Expect to spend several hundred dollars for the cheaper things.  I did learn a lot, and aside from his special parts everything else is clearly labeled and listed, so the book is far from a waste. Anyone reading this type of book should have enough of a background to be able to replace with their own cheaper components.  I did enjoy it as a good read, but please Mr. Iannini: lay off milking people from your site so much 
 I think of Caroline Myss' other two books as adding to my information and spiritual knowledge.  This boook however does not have the same effect.  It's main theme is to 'pay it forward'. 
 This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.  However that's about all the good things I can say about it.  I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..  There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.    There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.  The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by  telling what happens.  Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.  Give me "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman" or "Brides Of Blood" any day over this movie.  Jeff Marzano  Recommended further viewing:  Horror Hotel IT !

 This book is required for my finance class. However, this book doesn't explain the concepts well. For example what the book covered on the chapters have nothing to do with what were asked on the exercises. Students are often left in the dark trying to find themselves to come up with the formula (luckily we have the internet). If you buy this book make sure you have the TI BA II plus calculator. The book ONLY explains how to do most of the problems on THAT particular calculator instead of giving us the formula to use on any other calculator or using spreadsheet. Although there are some chapters that mentioned they will give instructions on how to solve the problems using MS excel but so far only chapter 1 gave us some basic information and rest of the chapters don't show anything (even though they mentioned it). So the words on the book and what you are actually getting don't match. Unless you have a very good instructor who's willing to work without getting help from the book, you are pretty screwed.   This book needs some serious editing (as I said the words and the contents don't match). 
 This may be entitled "Warner Bros. Classic Holiday Collection," but Warner Bros. had nothing to do with the production or distribution of Boys Town, Men of Boys Town, or the 1938 Christmas Carol. Louis B. Mayer may return to haunt the Christmases of those heretics against the one, true religion of MGM, who purloined Spencer Tracey, Mickey Rooney, and Ann Rutherford to enrich the reputations of Harry, Jack, Abe, and Ted. 
 My boyfriend bought me this book because we were experimenting with this and had mixed results.  Since it is not something you can really discuss with your girlfriends without getting really weird looks, he thought that this might help.  The amount of real guidance in this book is minimal.  The author basically tries to persuade you for the majority of the book that this isn't a nasty or strange act.  To an extent that makes sense since being mentally open is important but after a while it just seemed superfluous.    The only "tips" she really gives is to use lots of lube, communicate constantly (before, during and after), go slow and a few suggested positions.  All of which is common sense and I knew before reading this book.    A lot of these chapters just had tons of stories that said how awesome anal sex was.  She also got into some really hardcore stuff such as anal fisting and S&M that didn't appeal to me at all.  I didn't think she adequately warms you up for that either just throws in these really raunchy details that made my stomach turn.  I was expecting specific places to touch or where pressure can be applied, particular acts of foreplay involving the anus, angles of entry for comfort and pleasure etc.  I didn't find any of that.  The only sex guides that I felt were of any help got that specific.  Perhaps the author did that so we could adapt to our own style but I just thought it was too vague 
 This book, which was first published 1871 in German, is one of the most important works in the history of economics. In one single book Menger dismissed the labor theory of value to replace it by the theory of marginal utility. Some of his basic concepts had before been expressed by Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1854) and Stanley Jevons (1866), but their views were not widely adopted and Menger did not know their works. Menger's contribution goes far beyond the "Marginal Revolution": In one relatively small volume he developed a complete economic theory, which explains the nature of rent, wages, exchange value and money much more coherently than the classical economics of Smith and Ricardo did. Together with Leon Walras (both of them unaware of each others works) Menger layed the foundations of modern mainstream economics. Menger's work is far more accessible than Walras', also because Menger did nor regard Maths as relevant for economics. Adherents of the Austrian School of economics venerate Menger as the founder of their sect. Like Marx Menger was extremely literate, well versed in Aristotelian logic and able to read German, English, French, Italian, Latin an Old Greek, but his writing style (in German) is by far inferior to that of Marx.  There is one thing, that Marx, Menger and mainstream economics have in common: They mistake their models, which are abstractions of reality, for reality itself. Also Mengers theory, stringent as it otherwise is, has some obvious flaws: Menger can not convincingly explain entrepreneurial profit; he reduces it to a kind of wage, that the entrepreneur receives for organizing production. Menger ardently rejected the method of the contemporaneous German Historical School, but when it comes to explaining the nature of money, he amply uses historical facts in his argument. As he dismisses the notion, that money is based on convention, he gets into difficulty to explain, how worthless little pieces of copper can effectively act as secondary coins. On a close look Menger's whole theory is based on an incomplete axiom: Economy is not driven by people's needs, but by the needs of the people who can afford. Inequality of income distribution is a set fact before people begin to articulate their needs.  Where does this inequality of income distribution stem from? You can not sensibly exclude history from economics, if you want to answer this question. A clear hint to the answer lies in the fact, that serfdom had been abolished in Austria only 24 years before Menger wrote his "Principles". Of cause the former serfs were obliged to make high payments to their former feudal lords to recompense them for their loss - private property is sacred, you know. These recompensation payments were still under way in Menger's times. Though Menger frequently quotes examples of archaic handcraft in Eastern Europe, feudalism is not mentioned with one single word in his "Principles". Was it all by chance that Von Böhm-Bawerk, Von Hayek and Von Mises, the most prominent economists of the Austrian School that followed Menger, were all members of the (former feudal) aristocracy? 
 The author Feiler wrongly ignores (or honestly doesn't realize) that the Holy Bible claims mountains of Ararat to be where Noah's Ark landed. Not Mt. Ararat itself. In the early Christian era (long after the Old Testament was written down) Mt. Ararat was known instead as Masis Mons or Mt. Masis. The people of the early biblical writers's time all felt the Ararat region where the ark landed was far south of where Mt. Ararat is. There are many mountains that have traditions of being the mountain of Noah's Ark.    Feiler also refers to WW1 Russian pilots spotting something resembling the ark on ararat. This story is rather fictional. It was pretty much created by one writer Benjamin Allen in 1940 for a magazine. Roscovitski was the name of the pilot that Allen invented to have seen the ark.

 The brilliant and witty ethos of Cynthia Rowley and Ilene Rosenzweig shows creativity and talent. I HAVE BUT ONE CRITICISM...WHAT THE HECK ARE THESE GALS DOING ADVOCATING THE WEARING OF FUR ON CLOTHING???? THEY WILL BE INFLUENCING THE FEMALES OF THE LAND WITH THEIR FEMME FATALLE ADVICE. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ESPOUSE THE TREND OF WEARING FUR IN TODAY'S WORLD?IS IT ALL ABOUT THE MONEY????? IS THIS THE WAY OF THE WORLD TODAY?...MAKE A BUCK - DON'T CARE HOW YOU MAKE IT???? Take the "shahtoosh" for instance, that is advocated to wear in place of a coat, as the "in" thing. Unfortunately, the suggestions of wearing the shahtoosh will not help the already "endangered species" from which the shahtoosh will be made, which is the Tibetan antelope. So any of you naysayers out there think that this is just one animal, and who cares??? Well, we should all care about how many species on this planet we endanger or extinct. Why do two brilliantly funny and talented women want to create a market for animal fur adornment on clothing?? 
 It is obvious the author is brillant, but this book is not very interesting and the overall quality is poor.  If you compare this book -- it does not meet the grade. I can not recommend 
 I happen to think the pictures in this book are beautiful.  I wish I could achieve the same level of competence with color.  By buying the book, I hoped to improve my ability to quickly make sound color choices, but try as I have, I just can't get the needed information from this book.  I have purchased quite a few books on painting, and some have really helped me.  The really frustrating thing is that it's obvious she knows what she's doing, but equally obvious she has a hard time communicating it.  If you already understood the topic, I'm sure you would get some comforting reassurance from seeing that which you have grasped reaffirmed.     If you are not already a good artist, it's pure misery to try and figure out what she is saying.  I have read every word and studied every picture in some cases 3 to 5 times, and I have taken little away.  I'm sure that if she were watching me paint, I would eventually understand what she is teaching, but I was not able to get much from the book.  I did enjoy looking at the pictures, but the text is pure torture 
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 I was very disappointed with this sequel to Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife.  Berdoll spends far too much time developing new characters that she has created, and far too little time telling much new or interesting about the title characters.  More than half of the plot lines are spent on people far removed from Pemberly or the family, only to bring them together for a brief if memorable encounter in the end.  I think that the characters had some merit, though I picked up this book to hear about the Darcy's family life.  I found the entire first half of the book to be extremely tedious and had a difficult time getting through the chapters.  One main complaint is that the author takes the same information and re-examines it, then re-examines it again, and so on, and so on.  Often from a slightly different perspective, but very dull all the same.  I am appalled that she has bound it as a "new" story and feel that she saved herself a lot of time and creativity by not including nearly as much original material.   As for the over-attention to the Darcy's sex life, well I guess I am not a devotee of romance novels and though I like the characters, I get very bored very quickly with the repititious love-making.  It is too bad that these dominated the chapters written about the Darcys.  Overall, I found the second half somewhat interesting, but am sorry that I wasted my money on it.  It could be worth borrowing though 
 I am very familiar with the Taoistic approach to sex and circulation of energy through the 12 channels in the body. That's why I am surprised that Chia has NOT given full details about the circulation of the sexual energy. It is one thing to unleash the stored in you sexual energy BUT if you don't know precisely how to direct it through your body, you can easily end up with serious psychosomatic problems and damage your nervous system! Take a moment and ask yourself what do you want- health problems or orgasms!    In order to use this book you should have an excellent knowledge/experience in Qi Gong, Acupuncture or at least Taoistic Yoga. Otherwise you will play with fire! I know that it is interesting to deal with this kind of stuff BUT if you have NO idea about the different energy channels, chakras and acupuncture dots then I strongly recommend you to forget about this book because it will harm you more than it can help! Look for a safer approach 
 As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing.  Additionally, I found his writing skills poor.  His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging.  The book just ends, no real ending to the story.  As I said, I was very disppointed 
 Absurd humor is a very difficult thing to pull off. When it works, it's funnier than just about anything you can think of. And when it fails.... you get The Andy Milonakis Show.  The entire show revolves around a grown man who, for some reason, looks like a 12 year old boy (...whatever) doing weird things. Had this been executed with a little tact, or any sense of intelligence whatsoever, the possibilities could have been endless for this show. However, Andy Milonakis is a terrible performer, incredibly irritating, and the "writing" on the show is just about as lame and unfunny as it could possibly be.  Look, I'm a HUGE fan of absurd humor. Pretty much anything on adult swim, the Tenacious D show, Family Guy, Monty Python, Mr. Show, I live for that stuff. But leave it to MTV to pick up the worst, most watered down variant of this style of comedy to put on their pathetic network. It takes intelligence and skill to pull off a show like this, and Andy Milonakis doesn't have any of these things. Avoid at all costs 
 As a devotee of the Rendell/Wexford series, it grieves me to say this one strikes out.  I kept doggedly reading the thing, thinking, this surely can't be Rendell writing this.  I can't remember any detective story with such a cast of extraneous characters, so many red herrings thrown out.  The occasional insertion of Wexford's daughter Sylvia's predicament was refreshing, but the story itself bogged down quickly.  Two girls dead, some unknown connection between the two of them, lots of suspects.  Then comes the unlikelyl (absurd?) revelation of who the original ringleader was.  Sadly, then, this reader admits disappointment over End in Tears 
 For people that had tryed many ways to lose weight, that book is useless because contain no new information about how to do it. The method is less food, low calories and more exercise, just it. It has a few informations that can help understand how the metabolism works. 
 I'll admit I haven't yet finished this book.  I find it rather diffiult work.  Almost an act of faith in itself that by the end there will be revelation.  I'm not a religious person. Although Jimmy doesn't constantly bring up religion on every page, it does feel as though he does.  Hammering home Christianity, evangelism, fundamentalism and so on gets a little tiring for me.  If America has a moral crisis, it's more likely to be caused by religion than solved by it.  I don't need to believe in 'God' or 'our Saviour Jesus Christ' to have morals and morality. His heart is true but his message will probably only preach to the converted.  On the book itself, it's poor value.  Poorly made, thin, doubled spaced type and a reasonably large typeface.  I wonder what the wordcount is 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 Not the best score I've ever heard. Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc. I don't doubt Howard's talent as a composer, but the music for King Kong, sadly, doesn't have the same bite as the movie. 
 This book is incredibly confusing.  It takes a subject that can be written about very directly and clear, one in fact that's not all that complex (programming a simple Pic micro).  Unfortunately this book was written as though by a complete beginner.  The book severely lacks an understanding of the hardware and the connection of the microcrontroller to electronics theory couldn't be more vague.  The programmer with this board called 'el cheapo' makes a racist epithet in its name.  Furthermore, the PCB for this programmer is so poorly designed and fabricated you might as well build a different programmer from scratch or based on an open-source design.  This thing was a nightmare to use and build.  This is a beginner's book -- and when you're learning you need a good teacher and you need some foundations.  This book serves the purpose of neither 
 The importance of Derrida and his movement is monumental - not for the term "deconstructionism" (heard frequently without a clue to its true meaning) but for how he has influenced (Western) society. Derrida, like Marcuse, Chomsky, Foucault and others, has moved from his original study to a broader agenda and, like many intellectuals, considers his mastery of one subject transferrable to another.  He managed to survive the embarrassing Paul de Man fiasco and has since wisely avoided mention of the "Hitler in all of us".  He has remarked on the authoritarian anti-democratic nature of deconstructionism, treating the subject ironically.   This is, allegedly, a textbook of post-Modern thought on language but reads like a didactic, out-of-focus Proust. The writing is  nebulous, self-referential, unreadable. He speaks in Orwellian terms equating opposite qualities and words. It is so ephemeral as to lack certitude and for this very reason many commentators fear definitive statements on the subject. Deconstructionism is, despite all the twaddle, inherently subjective. He muses on expression, anxiety, emotions, signs and existentialism, finding meaning and interpretation where there is none. His popularity rests entirely on academia and like-minded camp followers in the media. I mean, how many Iowans care about the "ultimate" meaning of allusions? The problem with the ouevre is that  when taken seriously, it literally make mountains of molehills.  Such as, well, equating fairy tales to S&M sagas, symphonies to invitations to rape, skyscrapers to phallic power trips, signs of "white" recycled paper as racism and stuttering as aggression. Allusions are, in Derrida-speak, fraught with deep meaning. To accomplish this one must divorce words from their sources and stated intent. The critic has been necessarily elevated above the  author since only he can provide a "true"  meaning. It is so outrageous that few outside of the Ivory Towers give it credence. That would be a mistake. Language is perhaps the most human of all abilities and its interpretation affects our personal and collective consciousness. His method has been called the "language of cultural Marxism" and is a necessary component of modern leftist ideology.  At any time I expect Jacques Derrida to announce, like Alan Sokal, that it has all been a collosal joke on both the true believer and the reader 
 I am a third generation Christian Scientist and, contrary to what some reviewers have written, my church does not forbid me from reading what I want or seeking medical attention if that is my choice. Consequently, I read Ms. Fraser's book with interest. Like the author, I remember well my childhood in Christian Science. Unlike Ms. Fraser, though, I have nothing but wonderful memories of two loving and dedicated parents and a host of Sunday School teachers and friends who worked diligently to practice their faith. I know of several instances in which church members and people in my own family consulted medical doctors and in many of those cases it was Christian Science, not allopathic medicine, that healed. How can this be explained? And why is it that C.S. cannot be considered "Christian" when Jesus Christ Himself used no medicine nor consulted doctors to do the things He did? And didn't He say that the works He did we could do, too? What's that about if not turning to God in the FIRST instance for help rather than reserving such power as a last resort? And what of the children who have died under the care of Christian Scientists? What of the many, many more who have died at the hands of well-meaning doctors who, being all too human, often make mistakes. Witness the many news articles about mistakes involving vaccinations, clerical errors, misdiagnoses, amputations of incorrect body parts, and unproven therapies. And let's not forget all the so-called FDA approved drugs that later turn out to produce side effects equal to or worse than the disease they're supposed to cure! Tell me conventional medicine is the way to go? Even if I wasn't a C.S. I'd still be mighty reluctant to go the allopathic route. Why would I put my life in the hands of a mere mortal, no matter how well-educated, when I could put it back in the hands of the One who gave it to me to start with? Sort of like going to a shade-tree mechanic to fix a car problem that ought to be handled by the manufacturer.  If you really want to know what Christian Science is all about, and if you really want to know what Mary Baker Eddy said and did, talk to practicing C.S.'ists! Read Mrs. Eddy's voluminous writings on the subject. Read the writings of those who knew her and worked with her. And while you're at it, check out some of the secular quantum physics research currently underway that is exploding the notion of matter as substantial and "real." But if you'd rather cling to half-truths and factual twisting born of personal grudge and bias, then by all means make Ms. Fraser's book your gospel. Her historical facts may be straight on, but her presentation of them is tired and rife with the cliches about this religion that have been around since Mrs. Eddy's day. Christian Science has failed some but helped countless others. If you don't pay attention to the success stories, then you're not getting the full story. Reasoned and intelligent people know there are always two sides, and they take the time to investigate both 
 This is one of the worst plays ever published.  I thought Shakespeare was a fool after reading this complely pointless play.  Do not wase your money on this book because it is completly worthless.  A total waste of time to even read any of this play 
 This adapter is NOT for use with a radio! I live in a fairly strong signal area, and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out AM 800 (a 50kw station!), which is what I listen to most often! 
 I honestly don't know what to think of my reactions to books by Maureen McKade.  I've read seven of her books.  Four I've rated 5 stars, three zero stars.  I'm sorry to say that the only reason I gave this one two stars (zero in my personal notation book) is because I have enjoyed other stories from Ms. McKade so very much.  I have my notes on other McKade books and am amazed.  Evidently I either love her stories or I don't like them at all.  Sorry to say, this is a don't like it at all for me.  Widow Laurel Covey is on a mission to visit the families of soldiers who made death bed statements to her while she was a nurse for the Confederate side in the war which ended just six months past.  Creede Forrester was searching for her to find out if she knew whether his son had died in battle.  His information indicated his son was wounded but now that the war is over, he cannot find his son.  Once he finds Laurel and understands what her mission is, his conscience will not allow him to let her make the last visitation trips alone.  He goes along with her even though she plainly states that she does not want him. This story does not "resonate with heartfelt emotion" as the cover states, for me   it was just plain depressing.  Everything turned out well for Laurel and Creede in the ending but it was a struggle for me to wade through all the war recollections and emotional baggage Laurel was carrying.  I know, I know.  That was the whole point of the story, but uplifting it was not!  A little bit of "happy" along the way would have gone a long way toward making this an easier read.  So very much seriousness just weighed me down.  I didn't WANT to finish reading it but I did.  Was the introduction of the starving, orphaned kitten supposed to form some of the "happy" moments which were otherwise sadly lacking?  If so, it didn't work out that way for me.  How could we be expected to believe that a starving, orphaned kitten could walk fifteen miles from one campsite to the next?  If the starving, orphaned kitten could do it, why did the perfectly healthy horses only make it those fifteen miles?  See, I'm being picky, picky, picky.  But once it starts, everything begins to snag my attention and I loose concentration and the desire to continue to read.  Sorry to be so negative but I just cannot see myself recommending this to anyone without a strong warning first.  I have two more Maureen McKade books left to read.  If my yo-yo is correct, surely one of them should be a five star read.  
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark, yes for an actress turned singer she's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer... Would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal? I think not... Same goes for the other Latin Jennifer.. 
 It's terribly boring. period. This DVD makes me fall asleep very easily. Too many interviews and the video quality is really bad 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I turned it off after 20 minutes 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring.  The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing.  The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other.  Not my idea of a good time 
 This version  is a disaster. My expectations were dashed to pieces..No life. No emotion..An elevater rendition. .It is a joy that I have original (vinal) recording which is a near  masterpiece in movie music 
 Our bookgroup scheduled a speakerphone chat with Donna Woolfolk Cross, author of the "other" Pope Joan, and I bought this book by accident! I was so confused when everyone said how much they loved the book -- only to find out I had read the wrong one. I had so much trouble participating in the conversation because I had so much trouble slogging through this Royidis/Durrell version of the story.  The Royidis/Durrell version of Pope Joan is sl-o-o-o-w moving, old-fashioned (after all, it's more than 100 years old), and dull. In contrast, the Cross version is fast-paced, riveting and impossible to put down!  The notes at the end of the Cross book, documenting her research, are fascinating, and make it so clear that Joan was more than a fantasy.     If you insist on reading this version, read it for comparison purposes only, and enjoy a good snooze. If you want a great read, accompanied by actual historical reference, purchase the Cross version of Pope Joan 
 This tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill.. it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1/2 inch too narrow.  This causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported.  The tools have a very "cheap" feel to them. The tongs were the worst.. the handles are loose and they are prety much useless.  The knife won't hold an edge.  The spatula and tongs are marginal.  I would not recommend this item 
 I'm very disappointed because the word "Minature" is hidden in the parenthesis section after the title.  I didn't notice that when I ordered and do NOT want the miniature version 
 In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  "Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.  In his latest book "Collapse" Jared Diamond" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.  Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,   "It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair"  It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.  Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, "The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.   The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  
 Amazon image appears to be of standard edition while text without explanation of this being miniature press is buried far below. Looks like a crackerjack prize and contains only slightly more info. Very disappointing 
 The movie itself is a snoozer.  There's a good amount of physical comedy, but the story just went nowhere.  However, the running commentary is hilarious!  When the commentary is funnier than the movie, you know the movie is pretty bad 
 but it was a waste of money as my cats had zero interest in the grass 
 I tried to read and love this book several times , and I have a degree from Columbia in Literature and I read a lot of Fantasy but I just can't get into this book! Nothing HAPPENS! It just goes on and on and I can't like or identify with or wish to live vicariously through anybody! Isn't that what the Fantasy genre is supposed to be about 
 Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it. I pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.    Boy was I disappointed. I thought maybe I was having a bad day. Maybe my concentration was off. So I pulled out Truman Capote. Smooth as silk. So it wasn't my fault. It was Ron's. I finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting.   I wish I had not wasted the money. I must be more careful. But, as for this book, there is nothing I need to refer to later, so I'm putting it in the trash. It is Saturday evening. They will come on Monday to take it and the other garbage away.   Roger 
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 When I read Irving's "Son of the Circus" I thought that he would never write a better book. Sadly, I was right. "Widow for One Year" was a letdown, "The Fourth Hand" even worse. I began this book with some hope, but my hopes were quickly dashed. Irving's sense of the absurd has gotten out of hand, and "Until I Find You" is like reading a bad parody of his work. For one thing, virtually every part of his plot is simply implausible. The sex scenes between the children, however, was where this book got tossed into the trashcan. Irving apparently has no real sense of how children think of sex (which of course they do!) or how boys deal with girls. He has dedicated this junkheap of a book to his own young son, but when the boy finally is old enough to read it, I'm afraid he'll be as horrified as I. Beginning with "Garp" I devoured all his books. John Irving used to be one of those authors it was absolutely necessary to read, but now I'll never read another. This book was a waste of time and money and I resent every minute I lost reading it 
 There's not anything theological about this book at all. In fact, it's not about God, Jesus Christ, Christianity or any other religion. This is nothing more than a hate-mongering diatribe on why blacks should hate whites (and a poorly-written one at that). Here are just a few choice excerpts:  1. "[W]hiteness is the symbol of the Anti-christ."  2. "The goal of black theology is the destruction of everything white, so that blacks can be liberated from alien gods."  3. "The black experience is the feeling one has when attacking the enemy of black humanity by throwing a Molotov cocktail into a white-owned building and watching it go up in flames. We know, of course, that getting rid of evil takes something more than burning down buildings, but one must start somewhere."  4. "Black theology seeks to analyze the satanic nature of whiteness and by doing so prepare all nonwhites for revolutionary action."  5. "We have reached our limit of tolerance, and if it means death with dignity or life with humiliation we will choose the former. And if that is the choice, we will take some honkies with us."  6. "To be black is to be committed to destroying everything this country loves and adores."  Why anyone, regardless of race, creed, color or even religion would buy this rubbish is beyond me. It's nothing more than hate-as-theology 
 The book is alright. Nothing new or original. I bought it, read it 3 times and returned it unsatisfied. There are better books.  Check out the 2 reviews by the guys from VEGAS below me. Don't those reviews seem a bit too polished? I am betting they are either friends of the author or it is the author himself.   Pass this one up.  Frank Scoblete offers much better content, even though some of his books are amateur as far as graphics go. 
 I bought this movie because I love to see an old tale tespun and retold. If it is done well there is nothing better to read or watch. This movie is not a retelling of "Beauty and the Beast" as its title and premise would indicate. I own several versions of "Beauty and the Beast" on DVD and in print. And after reading the reviews here I was really looking forward to adding this movie to my collection and I was excited to have the chance to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be great! BUT IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I was prepared for the horses and I was prepared for the nudity and the eroticism. I was not prepared for the filmmaker's mangling of "Beauty and the Beast".  That is what the blurb on the box suggests. But instead of getting the Beauty and the Beast message of the redeeming power of love, you get a half-hearted sermon against bestiality. I didn't know that was such a problem in this world. I mean I have never had the urge and I don't know of anyone who has. There have been no reports on the news about people sexually assaulting livestock that I have heard. I am sure I would have heard something if such was the case. There is no excuse for what Borowczyk has done here. The movie starts out slow, I can forgive that, I have an attention span (too many people don't.) The story starts to pick up momentum and promise when the beast appears. Then the story heads for the cliff and unhesitatingly dives off! I saw the kernel of a good movie here. WHAT HAPPENED? Do yourself a favor. Skip this one 
 Nothing distinquishes this book from other books I looked at. I had installed a wireless network for four computers at home and had endless trouble - this book was no help at all.  To be fair I should point out that no other book was helpful to me either. It's full of jargon that accumulates very quickly so that after two chapters you can't remember what you 'learned' at the beginning.  Explanations are terse and leave you feeling stupid since you feel, of course, I should be understanding the book -after all its for dummies - but you don't.  I fear the void of good material for home networkers is still to be filled 
 The author thinks, acts and writes like it is 1970.  I would think that the five star reviews were from her friends and family but no one in the book liked her.  Do not waste your time or money on this  self centered idiot.  
 I was highly disappointed at the inaccuracy of the questions (min 4/per chapter as another reviewer wrote). I had taken a Net+ class about a year ago and worked 5 yrs in Techsupport so I wanted this to be a refresher. ExamCram test prep showed I was scoring 95 - 98% so I felt confident on taking the exam. When I read the questions on the exam, my heart sank. The book did NOT prepare me for the exam. There were items on there the practice questions didn't cover. Needless to say I didn't pass, am very disappointed in this product and it's going in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did! Buy another book!! 
 I don't really disagree with the other reviewers' evaluation of Piaf. She is truly one of the great artists of the 20th Century. I got this set; and then I got the 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection. This 2 CD set has only a  few songs recorded in the late 50's and early 60's when recording  technology could do justice to her voice. The 10 CD set has several CD's  recorded toward the end of her career. The recorded sound is outstanding;  and Piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end. I know the 10 CD is  expensive; but I prefer it above anything else I have by Piaf 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 i found this book interesting in places but boring in others.  author is sorely in need of an editor 
 I bought the Mac version of TurboTax Premier, and I installed it on my Mac with OS 10.3.9. After doing my entire return, I clicked to e-file and received a message saying, "Could not load attribute," This error box gave me the options to continue (which just took me back to the e-file page, which led me to the same error message) or connect to Intuit online support. The Intuit support site said, "This error occurs when attempting to file electronically.  If you are connecting through a router, try bypassing the router and filing again.  If the error persists, it may be necessary to file by paper.  We are currently working to resolve this error. . . . To be notified as soon as we have an answer, click here to sign up."  I don't have the technical know-how to "bypass the router." I also figured that if Intuit hadn't solved the problem by March 26 (the day I was ready to submit my return), they probably weren't going to, even if I were willing to hold onto my return until I'd received word they'd solved the problem. So I ended up mailing in my return. If I'd known up front that I wouldn't be able to e-file, I probably wouldn't bought the program. 
 Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment. Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do.  At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
 The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.  The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.  The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!  
 I'm disappointed with this book for several reasons, first off, you'll notice the tiny tiny print, it is very hard and frustrating to read a lot of this book for a bit of time, second, many many records are missing,also quite a few groups and artists are missing,3rdly it seems quite hastily organized, and can be quite confusing, 4thly there seems to be more emphasis on the labels and the manufacturer than the songs themselves.I realize that there are and were millions of records and songs etc,but there is a significant bunch of major hits and minor ones missing in this guide.Some of the flip side of the big hits is what is given as the value, and not the hit side, I know, because I have a lot of records from years past, as I said , there has to be better guides out there, and of course they probably do cost more.I do not dispute the values given for the records listed, because, as everybody knows, value is a relative term depending on the part of the country, the music that one likes, how much one is willing to pay for something etc 
 I bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6dB on the box.  The performance was worse than the original 2dB antenna that came with my wireless adapter.  Back it goes 
 The first song I heard by Katatonia was "Day". It is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard! I HAD to get this Brave Murder Day album after hearing that song. Wow, was I ever surprised when I got it. The album is much harsher than I expected - which is totally my fault. I had assumed the other tracks would be somewhat similar in sound. When, in fact, there were no other similar tracks.   My hope is that they release an album full of melodies of the likes of "Day" for wusies like me. 
 Great, more caterwalling from this self-obsessed, immature, indignant egomaniac. Do us all a favor Lizzy, and throw in the towel. You're schtick is overtired. You're pushing 40. Would you finally grow up and stop torturing the nation with your whining?  That's right, your depression was real. But you were 19. You were nothing but a scared little girl. It doesn't take a Harvard education to figure that out.  And this book, I yie yie. Please go on another bender and never ever take pen to paper again. You'll be doing us all a huge favor 
 This is junk, cheap plastic, no instructions, arrived with some pieces broken (not in shipping); much better products available for the cost.  From the description, I expected a much better product.  This is not it; a bargain at 1/3 the price, maybe 
 but that is about all, there is not much information on anything in the book, i think it is for those who are just entering the world of Anim 
 The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful.  It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism.  The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it.  The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos.  Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'.  It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers.  Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.  This movie could have been a classic 
  Nothing new here but lies and half truths..His assesment of Orthodoxy is totally garbage....Good book for the trash can 
 I love goth, rock, punk and reggae music but this is a load of wannabe rockers trying to be cool and failing quite miserably, i hope that this music doesn't get TO popular otherwise us Goths will have to release loads of albums to get this junk of the charts 
 Mr. "Dow 36,000" wants you to believe him this time.  No, really, he means it.  Right.  In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust.  I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust.  This guy is amazing 
 Interesting choices, but inadequate, often unreadable plans make any serious understanding of the prjects impossible 
 This phone is lovely to look at BUT... 1. The numbers on the touch pad wore off within 6 months. 2. The touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use.( it was a second phone used maybe 1- 4 times a week) 3.  The receiver cord is EXTREMELY short.  
 The notion that there is some pervasive conscious field or that one's conscious mind creates external reality is utter nonsense--and not even conjecture let alone scientific truth.    Beware of this author, for he has appeared on the film What the Bleep, a promotional psuedo-scientific video for the cult run by Ramtha, a woman claiming to be the channel for a 35,000 yhear old Cromagnon warrior from Atlantis.  You cannot make this stuff up!  Goswami is not associated with any true academic instituion and is so far off mainstream science that it is no longer science.  Older men of his age sometimes tend to turn to metaphysical pursuits to find a "scientific" validation for something beyond this life as impending death approaches.  But kid yourself not: This is NOT science.  It's bullsh*t.  Quantum mechanical processes have nothing inherent in them to elicit consciousness.  As of today, consciousness is still a complete mystery and there is no science to explain the phenomena.  What some like Goswami do, is take a subjec that few understand, namely quantum mechanics, which evokes the nebulous fuzzy notions of mystery, which also has a scientif buzz to it, and then presents it with terms like "superposition," "Schrodinger's cat," "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal," and effectively used the ignorance of the public at large to sell a false explanation of consciousness.  But ignorance of one subject does nothing to enlighten away the deeper ignorance of another topic, namely consciousness.  There is nothing falsifiable in Goswami's "thesis," hence it is not science but rather based on faith, and as such it is a religious argument that is based on really unfounded ideology and falsehood.  
 How can a movie get this many elements wrong?  Diane Keaton overacts to a painful degree (we've seen her talent in other movies, so we know she is much more capable than this).  The writers think that the "comedy" element of "romantic comedy" can be accomplished with silly sight gags like cakes falling on people's heads.  The overall plot has one seriously crippling flaw--Mandy Moore's character two-times men to a level in which she's getting engaged to one and considering moving in with another!  The viewer is expected to overlook her major indiscretions because she's cute and gets bossed around by her family.  The writers would like to have us treat it as if she was going on a few too many dinner dates, not seriously manipulating the lives of two men.  I went with a female friend to see Because I Said So in the theaters because I figured I could handle a slightly silly romantic comedy, and I was willing to overlook minor flaws to get a few good laughs.  I had to look long and hard to find redeeming qualities to the movie.  Actors Gabriel Macht (as Mandy Moore's loveable, guitar-playing, easy-going romantic boyfriend) and Stephen Collins (as the father of Gabriel Macht's character and a foil to Diane Keaton's mother role) are both outstanding.  The other actors have rotten comedic timing or a forceful method that makes the reader cringe instead of laugh.  You will laugh at a few sight gags (a balloon stuck to the back of Mandy Moore's dress, anyone?), and Keaton's wardrobe is a stunning marriage of retro and modern stylings, but there is little else to hold this film together 
 I cannot believe people actually worship a cold blooded serial killer just like Stalin. He is not a hero or revolutionary icon, he is a murderer and it was about time that someone had caught this dimwit and executed him.   He was also responsible for the torture of prisoners and anyone who had opposing views on the man was executed.     
 I hate to rate this book so low, but for me I could not sit through it.  After reading Sibs w/o Rivalry, this book did not seem well organized or written well.  The chapters are sort of condesending and not very deep - such as:  What to do when you bring them home from the hosptial.  Lighten up.  It's a really tough job...  If you want specific, real and practical tips on making a peaceful household with multiple children and helping your children get along with each other - turn to the other book.  This one is just not very good - sorry.. 
 Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift.   There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.    This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest.   For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here.  Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.   Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers   1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert)  3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert)  4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert)  7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert)  10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert)  14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert)  17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert)  19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)

 Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem.   Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 Another Reggae Gold with nothing but old songs.  Every song on the CD is over a year old.  Come on VP give us somethig fresh and new.     This formula is old, stale and boring.  For Reggae fans who like hot, fresh new music I recommend you check out '18 Karat Reggae Gold' it is a lot hotter.  Reggae Gold is like stale bread, 18 Karat Reggae Gold is hot fresh bread from the oven 
 It's not that the information insn't correct, but it certainly isn't insightful.  This seems like a mental exercise for a professor who just wants to get his name in print.  Right away you're in trouble becuase he has you go through an exercise and then rate your optimism to see if this book could help you.  if you are low on optimism, you need this book, if you are balanced, you need this book and if you are very optimistic, you still need this book.  My view, try to see things from others perspective and find out what your unique service and contribution is to a given situation and ulitmaley your whole life.  The rest will fall into place. 
 I was a little disappointed in the amount of HD footage displayed on this disc. I would tell anyone interested in HD video of the Space shuttle, you may be a little short changed. Many of the video scenes in space are in 480i with borders, the only HD video will be the takeoff and brief astronaut preparation shots. The disc is an excellent history package for space shuttle buffs 
 I HATED THIS MOVIE. It is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does... stupid plot - too many holes and stupid ending. 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.  Sorry 
 I can't even call this thing as a book. It's a disaster.Dont throw your money away.It is disorganized and leads you to nothing 
 If you are the mother of young children, or homeschooling your youngster to do art, then this is quite possibly the book for you. Assuming you have little or no knowledge of drawing, it takes you through the basics, in easy, child-level steps. I've used it with my little boy, and he's showing great talent, at least according to this book - it's hard to tell at this age. Book seems a bit limited, though, but at least for my boy the level of language is usefully simple 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 I bought this mobile when our last one wore out.  Our son does like to watch this one go and loves the music, but the quality is so poor, I can't give this any higher rating.  I had to return the first one we bought because the lullaby button did not work; both that mobile and this one buzz as they turn, as another reviewer commented; and the mobile goes through batteries like crazy, as another reviewer also remarked.  I hadn't had this mobile 2 weeks before it needed its first change of batteries--and I had started it with 4 brand new Duracell C-sized batteries.  Already, I have begun to have problems with the buttons on this mobile, which I haven't had for a month.  And I have to agree with the comment that it is rather large and ugly.  On the whole, I expected better from Fisher Price.  Since I haven't had this a month yet, I am thinking of returning this model to the store and getting a Baby Einstein model instead.  I have a friend who has that and his 5 month old loves it.  Like this model, it can be changed so that children can use it themselves once they're too old for the mobile-only function 
 As soon as this movie started and I saw "WWE" on my TV screen I said "This is gonna suck." And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.  The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie cliché and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk 
 I never received this item. I thought I ordered it and I just got this email asking me what I think of it.  However I don't see this item in my "last six months" orders.  Did something go wrong?  ANy ideas?  An 
 There is a single idea that permeates Koons work. This idea is neither good, nor original, nor indeed - since it has been 70 years since Duchamps "Fountain" - particularly exciting. If there were a "Ladybird book of Modern Art", Jeff's saccharine,  'easyfun' work would be that book.  Koons art-as-commodity schitck would be more convincing if the buying public had to decide. His commodities fail  as commodities - their status as art, is, of course guaranteed, since (see Duchamp) he has told us it is so.  Show me one more Scots Terrier made of flowers and I shall reach for my Uzi in a frenzy of post-modern criticis 
 Could not find any application for my needs. May be usefull for professional photographers with press print application in mind, but for andvanced and amatuers photographers is useles 
 The idea from the book is great; approach a complex subject as simple as possible.  Unfortunately I have missed theory and practical examples to prove and explain the matter.  The author stays too superficial and needs more persuasion to convince the reader that the subject can indeed be approached in a simple way. Finally I would have preferred some real life situations instead of movie quotes 
 These Brava anthologies get worse every time. It seems to me that two or three anthologies not unlike this one featuring pretty much the same authors are released every month. I noticed that some of the stories in Merry Christmas, Baby are not only undeveloped and too short for me to care about the characters, but they are also recycled. It is obvious to me that these authors are running out of ideas because this imprint makes them churn out crap at hyper speed. Donna Kaufman's Making Waves and Erin McCarthy's You, Actually are the better ones in this book. I was very disappointed with MaryJanice Davidson in this one. Undercover Claus is Santa Claws from Ellora's Cave's Naughty or Nice anthology, but with some minor alterations. The funny thing is that I read that Naughty or Nice anthology just a few days before reading this book. I can't help losing respect for an author who doesn't even bother to write an original story. I still love her work, but I shall read the stuff she writes for Berkley and for e-imprints in the future. I will read one of her Brava novels only if the plot is interesting (The Royal Treatment, which she wrote for Brava, was actually very good). The Lucy Monroe, Susanna Carr, and Nancy Warren novellas aren't any better. Having read Jingle Bell Rock last year, I should have known better than to read this one. Lucky for me, I borrowed this from a friend to amuse myself during the ninety-minute train ride to work. I suppose that this book was entertaining enough for work travel, but I couldn't help experiencing deja vu while I read the stories and a lot of the passages within them. I won't read any more of these Brava anthologies. They should give these authors some space to actually come out with good, or at least decent, material in the future. For the time being, I recommend the Secret anthologies from Red Sage Publishing 
 Dr. Gray must be a wonderful lover.  As a woman I read his hints and suggestions for a man's love making technique and marvel at his insight.  I truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom.   However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover.  By maintaining a position of gallant "ladies first" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women's sexuality.  There is much to be gained by men reading this book.  Attitudes can improve, skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book's suggestions. Women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of, not participants in, in bedroom activity 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 Book info: I read the 1st edition that was published in 1993.  Pre required knowledge or literature: None  General: The book is hard to read, every topic it handles it immediately goes deep into the subject, therefore you lose track   Book content:  In my opinion when talking about benchmarking you are looking e.g. at a process what you want to compare in performance with a standard or reference (process). You would say that ways of quantifying performance of a process for example OEE would be explained in this book, but it isn't. Therefore you get crap like "Section 8: Assessing Quality Maturity" (17% of book) and section 9: "A Bibliography of benchmarking literature" (9%) Appendixes (9%) etc. The book handles everything from a management perspective e.g. how to convince management; calculating costs of benchmarking; project management related issues; basically everything around benchmarking project and therefore forgetting the import issue itself BENCHMARKING. 
 When I first saw this book, I thought this sounds really interesting. It is, if you like to read trivia about economists, most of whom are dead. There are loose connections made to miscellaneous events in modern times, but the bulk of the book combines jokes that have been around for decades (as dead as the economists) with mini-biographies more suited to a fan magazine, focusing on John Stuart Mill's dysfunctional childhood, John Maynard Keynes' marriage to a ballerina, John Kenneth Galbraith's height, Thorstein Veblen's odd mode of dress and his lecture on cannibalism, and similar delicacies.   My impression is that the author found no use for this information when he was studying economics, but hated to throw out his boxes of notes. So he came up with a great, if dishonest, title and packaged the miscellany for sale. If you have no real interest in economics, but love gossip columns and want to sound like you know something about famous economists, this is the book for you 
 In this book Derek Fell takes a sensationalist, speculative approach to van Gogh's relationships with women, attempting to deconstruct them psychologically.  Speculation about van Gogh's life is inevitable, since there are many things we do not know or do not understand.  However, problems arise when the speculations in question have no basis in fact, or else are built upon erroneous information.  This book is positively riddled with both errors of fact (large and small) and unqualified speculation, severely damaging the author's credibility.  Given my limited space, I'll pick just two random examples to demonstrate the range.  Small: Fell cites at length (pp. 225-26) a letter describing van Gogh's funeral and says it was written by the journalist Albert [sic] Aurier.  Wrong.  It was written by the artist Emile Bernard TO Gabriel-Albert Aurier.  Large: On p. 173, Fell discusses the painting "First Steps," done while van Gogh was in the asylum at St-Remy.  Painted while van Gogh's sister-in-law was pregnant, Fell interprets the painting as van Gogh's fantasy of himself as the father of the child.  He does this through the painting's iconography, which depicts a man in a gardener's hat holding out his arms as a little child attempts to take its first steps from its mother to its father.  The man's hat looks like the hat van Gogh wore while working, Fell tells us, and he uses that resemblance to anchor his psychological interpretation of the painting.  What Fell does not say (maybe because he does not know?) is that this painting is van Gogh's copy after the painting "First Steps" by Millet-- the gardener's hat is Millet's motif, not van Gogh's.  Theo had sent Vincent a photograph of that Millet painting together with others in October 1889; Vincent (a longtime Millet fan) admired it so much he made a copy of it as he sometimes did with other paintings, particularly in the asylum when it was not always possible for him to go outside and find subjects.  Knowing this makes Fell's psychobabble analysis fall apart.   And there's speculation after speculation along that line.  Allegations that Theo physically abused Johanna; that Vincent carried on an affair with Marguerite Gachet and that's why he committed suicide, etc.  These kinds of things might --*might*--be acceptable if the book were a novel, but it's classified as nonfiction. That means it's just sloppy scholarship, the second most grievous sin of academic publishing (after plagiarism):  unverified information, hearsay, quotes taken out of context from letters, etc. (With reference to Marguerite Gachet, we're treated to more silly interpretations of paintings.)  When Fell does mention a source, it's usually some psychologist who I suspect doesn't know much more about Vincent than he does.   The danger of a book in a format like this one--without footnotes--is that the author is able to make errors and heap speculations without the reader knowing where he got his information (or didn't, as the case may be).  As a result, the unsuspecting reader with a casual interest in van Gogh might find him/herself believing what Fell has to say.  The pedigreed art historian and/or well-versed Vincent aficionado, however, will read this book, say "What??" on multiple occasions, turn to the bibliography to snicker at the gaping holes, and ultimately contemplate whether to use the book as a doorstop or a coaster, only because the spine is too bent to return it.  (The bit about a doorstop/coaster I have paraphrased from the cheesy 90s film "The Cutting Edge." I always cite my sources.)    As for Fell--he's described as an "art historian" on the back cover.  Allow me my own speculations based on the scholarly quality of this book: I'd venture a guess he either has no degree in art history at all, or certainly not an advanced one (M.A., Ph.D.).  I'm tired of unqualified people writing drivel about artists and paintings and calling themselves "art historians" (or publishers calling them that).  It's a professional insult to the rest of us who actually went to graduate school and built legitimate careers in the subject as professors, authors, etc.  Cease and desist!  
 Now I remember (again) why I hate Microsoft.  First, they come up with a terminology all their own, then they pretend that's the standard.  Like a "scripting host".  Because Microsoft has a product (an add on to fix the shortcomings of DOS, as I see it) called "Windows Scripting Host", suddenly scripting hosts are standard teminology.  I don't know about you, but to me a host is a machine on a network, usually a server of some kind.  No, to Microsoft the Unix Boune shell is a scripting host! The kicker is, even though they are promugating inferior products, simply by virtue of their marketing inertia, the products are sucessful and aided by all the third party software developers, consultants and writers/reviewers who bow at the altar of corporate myopia -- usually becaus eth products cannot stand on their own.  But this book makes no attempt to give an overview of how everything fits together: VBScript, WSH, WMI, Active Directory, etc., etc. This book is so inane, it doesn't even explain how to run the examples it is providing, until much later in the book (as another reviewer thankfully pointed out: chapter 3).  This chapter, by the way, is written in the same style as the rest of the book: it sets up a straw man then argues against that.  For example, in the first chapter the book makes the idiotic point that people hate scripts and think they are difficult.  Who are they talking about?  In chapter 3 they explain how difficult it is to use cmd.exe and how WSH is so much better.  Who cares?  Just explain what WSH does, period.  My thinking is that the authors probably bashed cmd.exe but that was censored by corporate. I only use Microsoft because I have to.  But I am still hoping against all odds that Linux and Mac put them out of business.  Read this book only if your have to.  Everything is there, just mixed up and convoluted like the Windows OS itself 
 If this is what hip-hop/rap has come to, then I give up.  This record is a bunch of ....  If you like vacant-minded lyrics and stupid ebonics, then this is the cd for you.  Listening to ludacris makes me feel like the music industry really has become nothing more than a pop/capitalist machine.  No talent, no originality, no clue, THAT is what ludacris is all about 
 My son was very excited about putting together this little blue robot. Although it looks cute and creative, when we put the robot together, we were both disappointed. The parts come apart as easily as they go together. It makes for a frustrating experience for a child. I think it was a waste of money. I hope the publishers of this book can re-think the design for future children 
 I originally purchased the set upon it's original release in 1990, over the years I have listened to it may times, continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time...always concluding that the tracks  (especially disc 1, disc 2 kicks in with "him or me") sounded like they came directly from vinyl,I have today just received the Sundazed Midnight Ride. Let me tell you if you love this stuff as I do, and want to hear the Raiders, pass on this collection, and get the Sundazed, the sound blows "Legend" out the door! I can't wait to get the rest on Sun. 
 T. Moffatt Burriss failed in his attempt to give HIS memoir of fighting  with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment during World War II.  The book  bounces from a historical narrative to a personal memoir, to a collection  of others memories.  All combined, this becomes a disorganized account of  one of the best fighting units of World War II.  Mr. Burriss is undoubtably  a brave man with combat jumps and many front line combat days, but he  should have either written a memoir or a history.  His attempt to do both  failed 
 My Mother gave me this book.  Said it had changed her life and I have seen significant changes in her dealing with anger.  However, after reading the book...I don't get it.  Rubin points out a lot of ways that anger manifests itself.  Many of which I was aware of, some not.  Unfortunately he never tells you how to go about recognizing and expressing your anger and feeling okay with that.  He only tells you that you are better off doing so.  Luckily it was a quick read 
 I ordered this book with great expectations, but was disappointed by the  fact that 75% of it was filler on the history of demons and demon releasement.  When you compare this book to Shakuntala Modi's work, it shows up the author's lack of professional background and knowledge on the subject and leads the reader into thinking that hypnotherapy is the only route to healing. Don't bother with contacting them for remote healing either; William Baldwin is no longer and you would be better off throwing your money into a deep well.  This is definately not a technical manual, but rather a history on spirit releasement 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 This book lacks examples.  It describes a function in English words but rarely gives an example of how to invoke it.  If you're trying to do File I/O this book is NOT for you 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each? 
 The more I read of this book, the more it seemed like a little mind-trip of self-indulgence for the author.  It's very difficult to take this book seriously when observing some of the comments the author makes.  For each book he rated there was a section called "What I liked about this book," and more than once his only comment in this section was, "everything."  While it's nice to see that he's truely writing about something he enjoys, maybe the author should stick to something more modest, such as a column in the local paper, rather than such an ambitious undertaking as this.  While not truely awful, the ambiguous format makes it painful reading 
 I was searching for titles on Peter of Cluny because an article in Christian History magazine showed that Peter understood that the only way to defeat militant Islam was to approach Muslims with love, learn what they believe, and attempt to share the Gospel with them.   Peter opposed the Crusades. He understood that while the Crusaders might win military victories they would not eliminate the ideas that motivated Muslims to conquer most of the known world because Jihad is commanded by Koran. Peter actually traveled to Toledo in former Moorish Spain and had books from Islam's vast libraries there - including Koran - translated from Arabic to Latin - he even hired a Muslim to be sure the translations were correct.   Peter then wrote two books, the first to Christians explaining what Islam teaches and the second to Muslims refuting Islam. Interestingly, Peter noticed that much of Islam - including the rejection of the deity of Christ - was simply a regurgitation of Christian heresies that had arisen and been refuted before Muhammad was even born. As such Peter saw Islam not as a separate religion but as a heretical form of Christianity.  As a lawyer working on a Ph.D. I know there is a bias prevalent in academia today that views all religions - and anybody who acts on the basis of his faith - with contempt. But true scholars know that you can only judge a religion on the basis of what its authoritative documents teach, not on the basis of what its supposed adherents say or do.  It adds nothing to our understanding to show that anybody can be intolerant, regardless of the faith he claims to profess. But it is important to understand that both Judaism and Christianity teach love your neighbor as you love yourself, a rule not shared by Islam.  I have not read Order & Exclusion and have posted these comments based solely on  the publisher's synopsis, which definitely desuades me from purchasing the book. It seems likely the author does not present Cluny or Christendom in light of the real differences between the teachings of  Islam compared to Judaism and Christianity but rather in light of the current academic contempt for all religion.    
 I have the VHS tapes of both of these concerts and the sound from the two DVD discs fell far short of coming anyway near the tape versions. It was a great disapointment 
 If you'd like to enter Dennett's Fantasy Land of self-satisfied, materialist reduction then this is the book for you.  If, however, you're looking for a work by a philosopher who can critically examine and defend his own theories and presuppositions then this book will probably strike you as a monumental waste of time.  To be sure, Dennett knows how to construct arguments -- the problem is that they're question-begging arguments.  And unless you share Dennett's materialist presuppostions you're going to find almost every page of this book filled with question-begging naivet.  Dennett, of course, has his reasons.  He claims that Cartesian Mind-Body dualism leads to unsolvable problems, hence we should resolve such dualism in favor of the tanglible Body and think like good (that is, consistent) materialists.  (And never mind philosophy prior to Descartes -- especially Aristotle, for whom the word "body" necessarily implies an informing and organizing "soul" or "form".  Such a "form" is, in Aristotle's account, precisely the reason why bodies are organized and not simply inchoate matter.  But never mind all that.  Dennett isn't really interested in the history of philosophy, the meanings of words, or an opponent that isn't a straw-man.)  But, despite Dennett's insistence on materialist consistency, the book is plagued by an inconsistent double-think which brings back the Mind-Body problem in its full force.  We have (or seem to have) immediate experience of our own minds or consciousness.  Dennett encourages us to reductively translate such experiences into neural processes.  The problem is, that we have experiences without being directly aware of the neural processes that are correlated to them.  That is, what we experience is not a neural process.  We infer the neural process and assume its correlation to what we experience.  Hence, the correlation of a particular neural process to a particular experience is purely speculative or hypothetical -- or at least it's speculative and hypothetical when Dennett doesn't simply present such correlation as a dogmatic belief.  Such dubious correlation calls into question the validity of the Mind's reduction to (or "translation" into) the Body.  If such translation is purely hypothetical or speculative, then Dennett hasn't moved one step beyond Mind-Body dualism (his materialist rhetoric notwithstanding).  Or put it this way.  I have an experience.  Someone may use MRI to try to determine what neural processes occur during my experience.  That person is not going to know the contents of my experience (or mind).  For that, he or she needs to rely on my own immediate or immanent account of my experience.  In other words, the observer of my neural processes simply grafts my own immanent account of consciousness onto those neural processes and assumes their correlation.  Dennett apparently fails to see that such a procedure assumes the immanent validity of a Mind's immediate self-experience (contra materialism) and that he himself relies on this assumption in order to attribute significance to the observed neural processes.    Basically, Dennett tells us that ordinary ideas about the mind or consciousness are naive.  He then proposes to replace our supposedly mistaken ideas with his own naive and question-begging ideas about Mind-Body correlation.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with this book 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 Sure,this cover can say she looks good and trying to look hot.She's trying so hard to give off an image that's not her.She's being and mostly acts like a tramp.Have you seen her videos?  Brintey can not break out of her shell and between the rebelious and outrageous lyrics,I see a sad girl being consumed by the media.Sure,she laughs and she looks as if she is having a good time on her videos but come on!Briney hides behind her clothes and lyrics and her record deal.It's all tenn pop lyrics penned down on her notepad while she's waiting in line!  I am dissapointed and I hope she writes better songs but from the heart,go Britney!Britney rock on please! 
 I took my undergrad fluid mechanics course using Crowe's lightweight doorstop. I took the course from Dr. Crowe himself. He certainly knows his fluid mechanics but if you go by his course and this book then he does not seem the least bit interested in handing down his knowledge to his students. At the time, about 2 years ago I gave this a 3/5 rating based upon my own naive assumption that I had a solid undergraduate background in fluid mechanics thanks to diligently studying and reading everything in this text. But it really took a graduate level fluids course to make me realize the serious deficiencies in this textbook. Save your hard earned money this book deserves zero stars and here's why:  The major drawbacks of the text are 1. No development of the differential forms of the govering equations. Conservation of mass, momentum and energy are all developed using the integral approach (via Reynolds Transport Theorem). He mentions the Navier-Stokes Equations in barely 2 pages and there is no further discussion about it. You could tear those pages out and you wouldn't lose continuity in the book (pun intended). No theoretical development thereafter requires the Navier-Stokes Equations. No surprise that solutions to the Navier Stokes equations are not included except for Couette and Poiseuille flows which are developed without the classical methods of simplifying the NS equations.  2. Lack of substantial mathematical sophistication. Fluid mechanics is best described with vector calculus and differtial equation. Surely there are many problems that are solvable with algebraic methods but Crowe essentially avoids anything mathematical. Therefore problem sets are suitably simplified so as to be amenable by the simplest mathematics. This is partly a consequence of doing away with the differential approach.  3. No mention of stream functions or potential flows!   4. This book misleads the novice into thinking that the panacea of all fluid mechanics problems is Bernoulli's equation. That is all you will really need to solve the problems in this text (apart from looking at the many tables, charts and graphs to find friction factors, drag coefficients, head loss factors and what have you). The unsteady form of Bernoulli's equation is left out; a consequence of omitting potential flows. The reader isn't told that Bernoulli's equation is a simplification of Euler's equations (only shown in streamwise co-ordinates) which are themselves a simplification of the Navier stokes equations.  5. There is very little development of fluid kinematics. No mention of the Langrangian derivative (and if there was it was again perfunctory and disposed off never to be recalled again). Vorticity is mentioned in passing and a few problems assigned which ammount to doing a bunch of cross products! The interplay between fluid rotationality (or irrotationality), viscosity (or lack of viscosity) and incompressibility and how they lead to the special (read: simpler) forms of the governing equations (namely Euler's and Bernoulli's equation) is omitted. Fluid element deformations and stress-strain arguments are left out in the cold (no need for them if you are washing your hands off of the differential approach).  5. Boundary layer theory is developed without stressing the classical length scale arguments that go into them, turbulence is restricted to using empirical correlations.   All these deficiencies in concept and mathematics were corrected only after I took a graduate level fluid mechanics course which essentially amounted me having to relearn everything considered "prerequisite" in addition to keeping up with the new material. Thoroughly deserves 0 stars. Don't take my word for it, use the book preview at Amazon.com and check out the table of contents. I suggest comparing this with the highly recommended undergraduate texts by Fox & Macdonald, or Munson, Young and Okiishi, or Frank White's excellent undergraduate text. 
 I am concerned about the published review as it looks like the author has given his own book a 5 star rating 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 In 1994, Morgan Heritage released MIRACLE, its lackluster debut LP, and followed it three years later with the superb PROTECT US JAH. Since then, the band has established a reputation for melodious, but uninspired, crossover albums that seem only to appeal to listeners with a casual interest in reggae music. For a band that began its career with glaringly mediocre music, coming "full circle" is nothing to celebrate.  In this latest offering, the band reasserts their formula of "safe" pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in the North American and British markets. Like previous albums, FULL CIRCLE meanders from R&B ("Enough Is Enough"; "Your Best Friend") to watered-down roots ("Propoganda"; "So Much to Come"), with a handful of dancehall tracks bolstered by guest appearances. Between the electric guitar riffs and the appearance of Bounty Killer on the final cut, it's obvious that the producers are trying desperately to reach the broadest possible audience.  As Rastafari reggae artists, Morgan Heritage's generic message and nonprovocative image stands in stark contrast to the raw energy and fervor of such contemporaries as Lutan Fyah and Capleton. Sadly, both FULL CIRCLE and Heritage's recent live performances stand as further evidence that the band isn't interested in producing anything other than slick, commercial, feel-good Jah music. This is unfortunate, because the Morgans are talented vocalists. Most tragic of all, however, is that the only time Heritage is provocative is when they're preaching intolerance toward Christians and homosexuals in their lyrics and concert interludes.  Despite its stylistic and lyrical inconsistency, the album is not without its strong points; highlights include the catchy, uptempo "Hail Up the Lion" and the dancehall remix of "U've Got Me". Even so, there isn't nearly enough substance here to keep you interested long, even if you happen to love the album initially. Expect copies of FULL CIRCLE to accumulate in used record stores over the next six months 
 David Cronenberg's "The Brood" is a disturbing and at times disgusting movie with a softcore element of creepinees.  That said, I did not find "The Brood" to be very scary at all.  The acting was good, but the storyline and plot just didn't do it for me.  Certainly an imaginative and creative story, "The Brood" centers around a mother's rage and psychological condition being manifested into little devilish like creatures by the help of a rather radical psychiatric treatment by Dr. Raglan, played well by Oliver Reed.  It is up to the husband of the pycholgically disturbed woman named Nola to save the day and to save their little girl's life.    The actual manifestations of Nola's rage are creepy in a sense and yet laughable as well.  Indeed, "The Brood" is pretty over the top and requires the audience to buy into the Nola's and the psychiatrist's joint ability to be able to manifest Nola's rage into a kind of human yet malignant form, but also accept these little creatures which are somewhat creepy but also quite ridiculous, as is the plot I might add.    Pure fans of the horror genre will walk away a bit unfulfilled after viewing "The Brood" which simply doesn't have "the bite" of a truly good horror movie and is in all honesty a very weird, outrageous and absolutely ridiculous movie.  I know I found myself weary of these absurd little creatures and their supposedly horror movie villain type prowess.  Finally, is it just me or is everyone in this movie absolutely crazy?  LOL.    Anyway, that said, fans of wild, unique and downright crazy horror movies may find this one interesting.  "The Brood" probably doesn't quite deserve two stars, but it is original and an eyebrow raiser if nothing else...that much is for sure 
 This is one of the many books, such as "Little Black Sambo" that many (white) adults have fond memories of, and most black people find deeply offensive. While many might feel that the characters could "be of any race" and that "it teaches children important lessons" and the the story is "beautiful and touching," I feel that it does perpetuate racism and stereotypes -- both overtly and in more subtle ways.  "Dar wuz dis sum pepuz who wuz settin, an dey wuz axin bawt dis mawnin, low dat dey waz tard. Dey kep runnin way fer ter fer home, sot dar wunner nudder, an de wuz gwine fas. Twel bimeby wuz atter fer ter ketch, bless grashus, hit wuz down ter dis day, an duh bimeby dey, gwineter git fer ter tell, deze yer, dish yer, an fer ter git, dey wuz dere an gun ter."  What important lesson does this teach young children? How could this apply to upper-middle income children in Marin, Westchester, or Cook Counties 
 I have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking, one thing after another.   Either one ear stops or they both stop in the same Hour!!!  I wouldn't dare unless you can return them easy 
 Although the "Everything Dog Book" has some helpful advice about selecting a dog & introducing it to your home, the training methods that it advocates are outdated, unnecessary, inefficient and inhumane.  The reliance on choke chains and forcing behavior are likely to lead to behavioral issues and can have a very negative affect on the relationship between dog and person.  There are far better ways to train a dog to obey that make learning enjoyable and easy for both dog and human.  Better options are: "Dog Training for Dummies", "The Dog Whisperer", and "For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health". The last two choices in particular are great choices as they offer a wealth of practical information that will apply through the life of your dog. For your dog's sake and your own, try a book that relies on training through positive reinforcement 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 First off, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Secondly, I have not actually read the book.  However, I have studied many religions including other Christian religions, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  Also I have read the excerpts from this book provided on the main website.  That gave me enough information to know that most of the information is false or has been twisted to provide a pejorative view point on the church.  As far as I can tell the book doesn't mention the fact that the children are being taught strong moral values like honesty and chastity.  These are attributes that seem to be lost in most of the world today.  Now this does not mean that members of the church are perfect and that they don't make mistakes but at least they are trying.  Moreover, there is no sign, in the excerpts, that all of the humanitarian work that the members of the church and the church itself does every year is ever mentioned.  Well of course not we wouldn't dare paint a real picture of the church if it makes it look better than what he may believe it is.    Here is a quote from the excerpts "Over sixty thousand fully-trained, adequately financed and prepared Mormon missionaries are serving in all parts of the United States and in over 124 countries around the world."  I was one of these supposedly "fully-trained" and "adequately financed" and "prepared" missionaries.  I don't know what the author considers "fully-trained" and "prepared" but I know that I would not have considered myself fully-trained.  I served as a missionary in Mexico.  I arrived there after 8 weeks of language and teaching training.  Being a linguist I also know that 8 weeks is hardly enough time to learn a foreign language let alone teaching skills.  And the reason that the missionaries are "adequately financed" is because many of them save up money for years or their parents provide the money for the missionary.  In cases where the family is not able to provide the money for the missionary to serve then members of the local congregation also can choose to help.  So what this really comes down to is if you want to know about any religious group or any other organization why do you go to someone who is obviously biased against it.  For example, when I wanted to know about Catholicism I went to my Catholic friends.  Same thing with Lutherans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and Jews.  If you want to know the truth about something go to those people that actually know.    If you want to know about Mormonism talk to a Mormon.  You shouldn't feel any pressure to become a member of the church yourself.  But you can learn and decide for yourself if the church is a good thing or a bad thing.  As a final note I know that many people who are not members of the LDS church are happy when their children make friends with kids who are members of the LDS church.  Because more often than not those children have higher moral values than many other kids in this day and time 
 I did not like the first book at all and not sure why I read the second, I guess that I am just stubborn that way.  I really enjoyed the concept of following Robert the Bruce through his consolidation of power.  The Scottish Monarchy is a fascinating story and one in which I have ordered a history book about to read the whole story.  What I didn't like about this book was that the battle between good and evil was too simplistic.  When situations got bad for Bruce or the Templars there was no real action or plot to save them, the Templars just prayed about it and some divine intervention would take care of the problem. I simply didn't like the fact that it was that easy.  I guess that I was looking for more drama or action from the divine forces.  A demon in rings doing mans bidding in a war against the Templars (I would have thought the church as a whole would have been a better target for this concept).  The Templar order falling apart from within was interesting and maybe I don't know enough about their real history to appreciate their treatment in this work.  This was not my favorite piece of historical fiction 
 Since my name is Dinah Gretsch and I have 13 grandchildren, how would I be able to buy my grandchildren this book, when Evil Gretsch is referred to?   Wonder how that name came up, since it is one of the most popular Guitar lines in the world and Paul is also one of the most popular guitar players?  
 Phillips book is flawed on a fundamental level.  As he works through his arugement he not only essentializes and trivializes the work of ecologists and ecocritics alike, he goes at them from a perspective wholly foregin to their own.  Phillips seems to be trying to play the role of the disillusioned environmentalist, yearning for a better, more equitable ecocritical paradigm, but in his self professed attempt to "philosophize with a hammer," he comes off instead as trying to completely undercut the ecological values and aesthetics of the Green Left.  He takes pot shots at everyone from Muir and Thoreau to Lopez, Dillard and Ammons.  Constantly crying foul at their lack of objectivity, Phillips argues that ecocritics should take on more of a scientific approach, and abandon the world of the spiritual, aesthetic and mystical. His attack at, what he considers to be, the cliche of the "ecological epiphany" is particularly barbed, as is his attack of Dillard's sense of the mystery and awe she feels when confronted with the Blue Ridge Mountains (he does quite a number on her "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek").  In the process of dismantaling the ecocritical aesthetic Phillips aligns himself with Joyce Carol Oates in trivializing the "REVERENCE, AWE, PIETY, MYSTICAL ONENESS" that characterize ecocritical responses.  In one of his attacks Phillips questions whether "any sense can be made out of" Andrew Pickering's assertion that "the claims that the Earth circles the Sun and that it rests on a stack of turtles were of equal validity."  At this point I should have stopped reading, because it should have become clear that Phillips is someone who just doesn't get it.  Clearly he is confusing facts with truth, mysticism with positivism, and in asserting that there is some fundemental problem with this statement he is revealing himself is an enemy of the ecocritical project. Clearly ecocriticism, being a young field, is in need of maturing, and admittedly Phillips points out some real problems in its application, but he falls into trap of cutting down the field without sewing new seeds or seeing to the fertility of the ground.  Clearly the values that Phillips has brought to the table are so fundamentally different from the ecocritics that he deems to speak of that they can never be reconciled.  I will however throw Phillips a bone and point out that he does admit to being unapologetically argumentative, though I'd say dismissive would be more accurate 
 The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!!  You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell?  Exxon?  Enron?!?  There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one.  I wonder what their incentive might be?? 
 Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesn't appreciate everything that his country does for him. His extremely one sided argument has no historical value, and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much 
 Tony Sweet's first book "Fine Art Nature Photography - Advanced Techniques and the Creative Process" proved very enjoyable.  I found it very both very helpful and really (in parts) inspirational, as attested to by the many unique images it contains as examples of both photographic concept and execution.  Particularly so since no digital "enhancements" were used (deliberately) at all.  But the newer book: "Fine Art Flower Photography ...", well, I'm not so certain of its merits.  As far as I could determine, there's not a single new technique set out in this second publication.  Sure, the author does explore the use of a tilt and shift lens and of a diffusion filter, but both in a very classical manner.  While the use of "surrounding props" - such as spider webs, dewdrops, etc. - is very thoughtful and artistic, the remainder of the worked floral image examples he presents involve just a little tweaking of the procedures for multiple exposure and multiple slide assemblies which were introduced in the initial handbook.  And indeed, some of the floral subjects are the same as were used and presented already in his "first volume"(!).  In fact, it's almost as if the author wished he had waited just a little longer to publish a definitive account of all of his work, but has decided just to play catch-up with the newer collection.  Also it seems that there are a couple of missed opportunities.  For example, there's a beautiful image (of an egret in flight) in the first book where fill-in flash is utilized.  But the technique for using and/or developing this further is left aside and is by-passed totally for the floral image studies in the later book (even though at one point the flash-unit is definitely mounted on the camera - see p.82!).  Additionally, since colour contrast is such a critical feature of many of these images, I was left pondering whether the multi-slide technique could use a saturated colour image paired with an appropriately filtered black-and-white exposure.  All-in-all, if you already own the nature photography book, you're not likely to gather much that's truly new from the floral one.  On the other hand, for a double dose of inspiration .. 
 Warning to all parents purchasing this for a child. Both vol 1 and 2 contain nudity and may not be suitable for children. Guess that's the difference between a comic book and a graphic novel.. 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 Scientology is a dangerous cult and Szasz is one of its biggest supporters. And some believe you should just change your lifestyle and you can rid yourself of Cancer, too.  Most rational scientists and mental health providers know that many different types of therapy--changing personal conduct as well as medicine and therapy--work, oftentimes very well together. Beware ANYONE who says: This is the only way 
 This book reminded me of a porn movie; lots of sex but no plot and no character development.  How did these two decide that they loved each other anyway? All they really seemed to know about each other was how to make the other climax.  This was a real disappointment.  I like steamy sex scenes too, but they have to be built around characters that I grow to care about and get to know.  There was no romance in this book at all 
 Pretty salty and hip but I kept having to look at my big map to figure out how to get to the places it was referring to.  If I have to comment on a major fault, it is with the directions.  It doesn't stand alone as the only guidebook to maneuver you through San Francisco streets.  Luckilyl I met many friendly locals who helped point me in the right direction.  It's a fine city and has a splendid old park to stroll 
 Randi comes across as a man who has missed the mark with his own life and now needs some justification for his existence which he finds in putting down people - it doesn't matter who is in question - all his books, including this one - say only how much he is pissed with his own life.  Uri Geller and others are incidental.    All of his books are biased - the only things that he has printed in them is forcing his point of view, whatever he chooses to believe as the "truth".    His books have nothing to do with any scientific research or proofs - they seem to come from an adolescent rebel.  His entire attitude is "I dare you to show me the proof, but I'll make sure to get you to see only what I want you to see, because I don't care to be objective - I only care to prove that I am right - even I'm wrong.  And any evidence to the contrary, I'll find the way to delete."  The only thing that Randi seems to delight in disseminating is anger - not information.  There is some deep unhappiness in Randi, and that has nothing to do with Uri Geller - it has to do with Randi being pissed with his own little limited world, because there's more to this world than meets the eye, but Randi doesn't know how to get it so it thrills him to deny even the possibility of such pleasure to everyone else.  Randi is hiding his own dark secrets that he is terrified to face and just as magicians and illusionists use distraction to get your attention elsewhere, so is he so badly attempting to distract both himself and others from what truly ails me.  Now Uri Geller and others are supposed to serve as scapegoats for Randi's feeings of unhappiness and lack of self-worth, because now that he has happily managed to put others down - he's bound to feel million times better about himself.  Now, finally he can perceive himself as a saint - or at least fake it as long as he can.  As for the rest, before you do judge Uri Geller, or whomever else Randi is pointing his finger at - get to know those people personally with an open-mind.  The world you discover just may not be as Randi would want you to believe and if you call yourself critical thinkers - then you should based your own critical judgment upon some solid evidence from your own personal experience and not the hear-say that Randi wants to serve you. 
 A travesty of tacky talent and too-little imagination.    How anyone thought they could improve on Ann Margaret is beyond me.  
 this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America! 
 First a little background... I'm 53 with a preteen son. I'm not quite a Luddite.  I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. Our "big" present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts.   I've read a few books recently on the gaming "culture" to better understand it. This book came highly recommended from reviews here, so I read it.  My reaction to the book? It took a while, but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. There are lots of great statistics, but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how it's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future.    I did learn a few things. I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer.  A main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out, because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. Interesting, since by the examples cited, it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. I call it learn by trying anything, as opposed to learn by thinking. Both have their place.  Supposedly, gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore.  I could go on, but I think you get the point. The book says little (nothing?) about how video games are helping gamers learn math, science, or reading. Personally, I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more important to a person's future than the ability to learn thru trial and error.   Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be correct. I hope so. But personally, I'm concerned for any business that runs on the pure gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book. 
 There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.  So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation.  "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought.  It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film.  "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market.  Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.     And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.   KGHarris, 11/06 
 I have two adult female cats who don't like each other.  This book didn't give me any new ideas about how to overcome this problem, and for anyone who knows their pets well, this is a complete waste of money.  What REALLY irritated me is that there was a section devoted to male-male aggression but nothing about female-female or male-female problems!!  There were so many glaring omissions about basic cat "body language" and behavior, that I became more annoyed the more I read.  I was VERY disappointed 
 This book purports to be both a critique of Postmodern culture and a Biblical path into the future.  In the end it is an almost total acceptance of the postmodern revolt against enlightenment rationalism, complete with the implication that the Christian church of the last few centuries is hopelessly absorbed into that "enlightenment project".    While the authors do a bit of critique of the fringes of radical PM, they have totally woven themselves into the garment.  True to the more radical positions of the PM movement, the assumption is that that we have two choices and only two - Modernist arrogance or Postmodern subjectivity.  While they authors accept the PM notion that all "totalizing" systems are evil, they blindly swallow the most totalizing and destructive notion of all, that we are hopelessly locked into subjectivity about anything and everything.  In addition, regular usage of left of center code words such as "victim", "oppressor", "violence" and "terror" show the real cards the authors are holding.  If you have a position of power or influence it is assumed you MUST be an oppressor, you have no choice because of your Western Enlightenment cultural arrogance.  If you suggest you know something truly, you are part of the enlightenment system "totalizing" intellectual constructivism and thus of violent oppression.  Simply asserting that something is true is an act of intellectual violence, which crushes the dignity of someone else whose viewpoint is different.    Their solution is to embrace the metanarrative of the Biblical story, in which the oppressed and suffering Israelites are rescued from Egypt, or in which Christ's identification with the poor and oppressed lights a path to radical equality.  So they suggest a third alternative in a Biblical Metanarrative, but even that solution assumes the very philosophy they supposedly are critiquing.	  In the end, though much is said about the Bible, since nothing can be deemed objective, the Bible cannot be used to test and evaluate the validity of Socrates, Bacon, Derrida, Foucault or anyone else.  Scripture is just another story that may be intriguing and in fact unique because it seems to suggest answers that are not "oppressive" to the "marginalized".   The proposed answer is to subjectively enter the "story" of the text and creatively write new chapters of the history of salvation based on what is in the end, very squishy and uncertain estimations of what God might be doing.    Thus PM eisogesis is imposed on the text.  The Old Testament is not a story of human rebellion against God and honest records of triumphs and failings of fallen humans, rather it is reinterpreted from a PM viewpoint as a story of God's actions to right injustice and thwart the oppression of the marginalized by the unjust rulers.  In the NT Christ's resurrection has more to do with identifying with the poor and oppressed than any 2000-year-old orthodox sense of atoning for personal sin.   The difference between these ramblings and the prophetic (though not flawless) analysis of someone like Francis Schaeffer is that Schaeffer rejected BOTH modernist rationalism AND the growing rejection of and "escape from" reason.  As fallen and finite beings we can never know exhaustively or perfectly, but we can know sufficiently and truly - objectivity is imperfect, but not an illusion.  This inability of PM thinkers to see culture and personal perspective as an influence on but not a complete destruction of objective reality is frightening.   It is also silly.  Try as the PM advocates might to deny reality, it ends up crashing down on them eventually.    I suppose I could go down to my bank and suggest to the officers there that my perception of my account balance is quite different from their totalizing linguistic construct.  As they try to toss me out on my ear, I could protest that their objective reading of the data is hopelessly enmeshed in their modernist illusions of objectivity and certainty and such totalizing views of mathematics and western economics are oppressive and violent to my freedom and dignity and economic well being.  I could suggest that they should identify with my oppressed state.  Of course the violence they would do to me at that point would go beyond language games.  And the objective reality of my actual account balance would not bend to my subjective construction of it. 	 Modernism may need correcting, but intellectual suicide is not the answer. 	 
 This book lacks the information about the horse more info of everything else. The book put more effort into the apparel and activites of the horse. Than actually telling about horses and what they need 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I was also really disappointed with Romano's book. Too narrowly focused on only the NYTimes crossword puzzle and too broadly concerned with Marc Romano's ego. I don't know where his editor was, the information is so repetative and disorganized, at the same time you never really get a feel for the persons who love crosswords to the point of obsession. I also wish he had given some examples of some of the often wonderful puns and cleverness that grace the Sunday puzzle.  Many a time when I (finally) saw the answer I would laugh out loud. I am really in awe of anyone who can construct a puzzle and wished Romano would have given us a lot more info on those people. Finally, as a horticulturist I couldn't help notice his definition of kapok, which is no more a "palm-based filler" than a tomato is a kind of meat. Kapok is the silky down of the seedpod of the tropical decidious tree Ceiba pentranda or Kapok tree. Definitely not a palm. For Romano's sake let's hope "palm-based filler" will not be a clue in next year's American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. 
  One reviewer below cries that 99.9% of the names on the VietNam War Memorical Wall are of men. Typical of people who like Farrell's style of 'research' he neglects to mention one key fact: women were kept out of combat roles and indeed out of the military just about entirely during that era.  Who did this to women? Powerful men who substituted chivalry for justice.  Farrell and his readers blame women for this.  Why shouldn't they? If htey blamed those powerful men it require that they surrender power, too, and they're not willing to do that, even while they claim victim status for the gender that occupies some positions Farrell doesn't want to cite:  98% of Fortune 500 CEOS, 90% of all violent criminals, 85% of police officers and military, and so forth. All of that is power.  Farrell would have you believe that this is ephemeral power that doesn't really exist on the street level for the ordinary guy. Tell that to any rape victim.    Farrell's section about Laurie Dann ought to give pause to his fans, but it doesn't. Like other backlashers, he makes wild charges and yet doesn't get close to the facts. Not hte least of his errors is this: Dann did not have a son.  Dann did not accuse an eight-year-old boy of rape. And so forth. Let nothing, however, get in the way of the male quest for victim status.     Farrell's been dining out on his status as a former male member of NOW for ages, but he neglects to mention that  his alleged feminism ended when his wife divorced him.  Farrell's been treating feminism since then the way a scorned lover treats the ex's photo: as something to be bitterly defaced. He got rejected and he's never recovered.    I wonder if readers approaching this 'poor me' catalogue of badly-researched drivel are aware of two important items in Farrell's past that he tries to hide:  *His infamous 1987 Penthouse magazine interview in which he talked about positive father/daughter incest---approvingly;  and *His statement that "Before we called it date rape, we called it a good time."  Farrell likes to say he was a feminist but he was sunshine feminist when 'feminist' meant 'free love.' Once it became clear there were no more freebies for 'what's-in-it-for-me-male-feminists' he turned his back and got downright hostile. He's been writing badly-researched drivel ever since.      He relies on biased sources, cherrypicked quotes, and dubious logic to support his thesis, that men are really powerless instead of women.  In a way, it's awe-inspiring, how he manages to turn examples of literal power into powerlessness, but looking at it from another s ide, it's frightening, too.  His beliefs and his writing justify a lot of hostility and outright hatred against women, and for that he deserves notice.       People who want to read a sincere exploration of the trials and tribulations of modern masculinity would do better to pick up Susan Faludi's "Stiffed." It features better research, better logic--not that that's saying much---and genuine compassion.  
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 I saw this book in a store and LOVED it.  It gives reviews on each ride for preschool, grade school, etc.  Then it tells you about the "fright potential"  YEA RIGHT.  Many rides were rated no fright potential and scared the snot out of every young kid in the place.  The Winnie the pooh ride for example was rated "Not firghtening in any respect" and "Cute as Pooh bear himself".  So I take my 3 year old on to discover it is a ride though the hurricane from the orignal Winnie the pooh blustery day movie.  You even ride though owls house that is shaking its self apart.  Roo is being blown away, and kango is trying to catch him, etc.  The stupid ride is even complete with the nightmare scene about heffulumps and woozles (not Lumpy, the old scarey original heffulumps and woozles all done HUGE in neon paint with black lights spinning on them).  The original sound track of beware, beware, BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!! is playing all around you so loud it is hard to hear your screaming child.  Over and over I read the book and said "This ride is ok sweety" and over and over again my daughter and most of the other kids got the snot scared out of them.  By the time I got to the it's a small world ride my daughter was begging to not go on anymore rides and she was in the fetal position though the first half of the ride, afraid to even look up for fear of what she would see.  If you love your small kids DO NOT TRUST THIS BOOK!!!  
 I am a 7th grade student and we use this book for health class.  Most of my friends and I think that the lessons don't make sense.  We did the  chapter on emotional health this week.  I had to ask my mom who is a  counselor to explain the lesson and even she had difficulty understanding  what they were trying to say.  This is a very confusing book.  We were  going to buy the book so we could work on the lessons at home but it costs  too much 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I have been doing origami for about 10 years, and have had great success with modular origami (mostly from "Unit Origami" by Tomoko Fuse).  This book has diagrams that are hard to understand, the colored side of the paper is not even marked so it's very difficult to know if you are folding correctly.  There are no written instructions, only the bad diagrams and I could not make a single model from this book.  Even the few photos of the completed models were in black and white and not very good photos at all.  I would recommend Fuse's book or another modular origami book with better diagrams.  For those that have had success with models from this book, congratulations, but even with my usual vast amount of patience it did not take long for me to throw this book across the room in frustration.  However, I will say that the models are very unique and beatiful and if you can do them, they should be very satisfying. I am copying this same review for "3-d Geometric Origami" by Gurkewitz and Arnstein, for I felt the same was true of that book 
 I was bought this present for valentines day. It's pretty. I do wear them for everyday us 
 I'm not a tech guy.  But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance.  About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.    I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement.  But there is nothing there.  Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell.  Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.  Save your money.  Don't buy it.  
 Don't waste your money on this one!  A vast majority of the websites are no longer valid.  The author really needs to issue a revised edition.  It is rather unfortunate too because it it put together so well and in a easy to use format...it just needs a refresher edition 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 While an occasionally entertaining read , it is essentially useless for anyone looking for a "how to" book. There are a few helpful hints in the book, but overall is a waste of time. I found myself hurrying to finish it to get a book that might be useful. At least it was cheap 
 The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.  Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time 
 I bought this book for my economics class at Dartmouth College, but it was a horrible book. The text is wordy, verbose, too long. A lot of times, there are unnecessarily explains simple things too long. I hope all of you  will find better labor economics text book 
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces. 
 The scandals themselves were interesting however I found the book hard to read.  Some of the information was repetitive from chapter to chapter and it was not well written.  I was looking for something that I could just pick up an read a story at a time and this was not the book for that 
 Not the best workbook I have seen. It is not very interactive either. It also has a lot of references to religion 
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 If you like Maya Angelou's cookbook, you'll like this. Otherwise, keep searching for a cookbook that actually gives you recipes. Because that is what you are really looking for, right?   This book should be under autobiographies 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 I really wanted to like this gadget, but I've ultimately been disappointed.  The idea is COOL, being able to see your family and carry on a FREE Internet phone conversation with them, and the price is much less than other videophone solutions out there.  Alas, there are a few problems still to be worked out with this device.  Here's the saga of trying to just get the device to work with my network setup.  I tried calling Dlink (the i2eye manufacturer), Linksys (for my router setup), Comcast (broadband connection) and SunRocket (VOIP) for support on this issue.  I eventually got the device to work connecting to my parents' wireless version of the i2eye (which I setup through a USR wireless broadband router by opening the required ports) by connecting my i2eye (the wired ethernet version) directly to my cable modem (without my Linksys broadband router or SunRocket VOIP box in the equation).  I then tested various configurations until I was able to determine that the Linksys router (model WRTGS) was not forwarding ports correctly (I HAD properly configured port forwarding).  Linksys tech support tried but failed to help me out.  I swapped routers with my girlfriend who had a Dlink router and the problem went away (after also configuring port forwarding).  Would have been nice if Dlink could have told me when I called them for support that my router wasn't compatible with their device (though it's possible that my Linksys router has a "broken" port forwarding feature).  I also had to forward ports through my VOIP box which the SunRocket tech support people quickly told me how to do.  So I eventually got the damn thing working after a month and a half of trying.  Of course that is two weeks after the standard return policy of ANTonline expires (who I bought the device from through Amazon).    Now to performance.  Even when the i2eye is connected directly to my broadband cable modem my framerate never rises above 5 frames per second.  That's both for the transmitted and received data stream.  (On my parents' end I have to connect wirelessly through their wireless router as their TV is too far from their cable modem.)  I've tried tweaking the "speed" settings on the i2eye to adjust the amount of data the device is configured to send and receive, but I never got an improvement.  Dlink advertises that you can get up to 30 frames per second using a high quality broadband connection (like mine and my parents').  I haven't tested my broadband connection's total upload and download speed because I simply don't know how (probably need some third party utility program).  Regardless I SHOULD be getting at least 500kbps upload speed and at least 1Mbps download speed (at both mine and my parent's end) as that is typical of cable broadband connections.  Also the image quality from the i2eye's "lens" and CCD is horrendous.  The brightness, contrast and general overall "sharpness" of the image is lousy.  That's simply not acceptable.  You can get better framerates (along with much better image quality) from a good webcam using one of the "messenger" applications out there.  Which is what I'm going to explore doing next.  I'm going to attempt to return the devices now (both mine and my parents' i2eye) through ANTonline and Amazon with the argument that the i2eye devices don't perform as advertised and that I'm "late" returning them because of the difficulty in testing the devices (you have to coordinate with the people at the other end of the connection to determine if your own configuration is working).  I'll try to post an update to this review with the results of that attempt.  Unless they can improve framerate throughput through some kind of data compression technology upgrade, I can't recommend this device to anyone.  Less critical improvements would be a better quality camera (and microphone) onboard and better support for setting up the devices (a dedicated i2eye server you can connect to test your i2eye configuration settings) including a list of supported and non-supported routers.    Hope this helps someone else avoid the headaches and hassles I've been subjected to by this device.  Andre 
 I just got this book for my 4 year old daughter yesterday.  The illustrations look as though a child has done them (the cover does not accurately represent the rest of the drawings inside).  The story itself does not feel informative or coherant.  The one part of the book that disturbed me so bad was an adult man and a little boy in what looks like a tub and the illustrator actually put a small penis on the little boy-it is talking about how farts make bubbles in this scene.  The idea of this book had the potential of being funny and informative, as it is written now with it's crude drawings and less than fantastic story line, I do not recommend this book to anyone and it is the only book (children/adult or otherwise) that I have read that should be completely destroyed so no one else has to be subjected to its idiocies 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 Unfortunately, Jem's review was posted just after I ordered this or I could've saved some money. I debated whether to post a critical review because I suppose as a stroke-fest this would be okay (although the ridiculous circumstances & repetitiveness of the couplings/groupings greatly diminishes the intended impact, but that's just me). However, when I rechecked the summary to see what had made me order it in the first place, I decided to add my comments.  The summary, though brief, implies a romance or some kind of relationship between the two men. This just isn't the case. When Jake suddenly thinks to himself that he loves Ben, I literally said "What?!" out loud. There was no basis for that feeling & there never is throughout the book. I was tempted to give up reading it at several points but I kept hoping it would turn into a real romance at some point. Nope.  I guess I shouldn't expect monogamy in something billed as an erotic novel but geesh! These guys do it with everybody and anybody. Doesn't matter if they're being held prisoner & their life is in danger, they're up for it! Apparently, nothing is ever rape, because they want it anytime, anywhere.  When it ended on a cliff hanger, that was the last straw. It's not like I care what happens to them & I certainly don't feel compelled to buy the next book to see how it turns out, but it would've been nice for this to have had a real ending 
 As someone who has "fallen in" to costume design, I was hoping that this would be a great reference that would help me to get my ideas across to my director, but it has done little more than show how to  proportion the male and female figures correctly.  I was dissapointed in  the lack of technical information about drawing fabrics on the human  figure.  Instead of technique, it gives a very brief overview of what  changed in the line of the garments and has a half silhouette on the side  of the page to show how the figure changed from period to period.  There  are several fashion history books availible that have much better overviews  and illustrations.  Only a few examples on four pages are given for each  period 
 The Church of Scientology teaches that millions of years ago and evil alien leader came to earth with a fleet of "space planes" and killed huge amounts of aliens whos souls haunt us to this day. That was the stupidest thing I've ever heard until I read Mrs. Browne's book 
 We thought we had ordered the textbook, Microeconomics: Principles, Problems, and Policies by McConnell and Brue.  This book however is Selected Material from Microeconomics.  The Table of Contents is the same  as the textbook, so this is really confusing.  Be sure you get what you  want 
 Too simple, too brief and quite out-dated figues  and pictures illustration. Anyone buy this book and hopping to learn something out from it will be quite disappointed 
 Ok,  I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct.  This jerky is not very good.  In fact, I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard.  Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together.  Trust me when people say this : there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there.  I even e-mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky.  They offered me a refund and I should of taken it, but I decided not to 
 There are alot of great pictures of arrangements in this book, but very little about the actual construction.  I bought 8 floral books and this was the only one that disappointed.  It does make a decent coffee table book, though.  If you really want this book, buy the used copy. You won't feel so cheated that way 
 Mr. Carroll has written a book chock full of his arm chair theorizing on a wide variety of topics, that, according to him, he has spend years of researching and thinking about.    What bothers me the most about this book is that Mr. Carroll is so absolute in his belief to non believe that you wonder how he wrote another book on critical thinking.  I find no critical thinking whatsoever here; just a mess of one man's opinions.  It would of been better if Mr. Carroll created a scholarly/scientific work that myth busts but offers more heft with analysis. Me thinks that Mr. Carroll does not have enough "gravitas" to critically examine what he deems to be silly and inane.  Not on a point by point basis, mind you, but as a whole.  And while I do agree with Mr. Carroll that there are charletans and bogus claims made by many delusional people, he makes the big mistake in discounting all in order to fit his black and white philosphy of the hardened skeptic.  Mr. Carroll strikes me as many I have met who are into/studied philosphy (he is a philosphy professor) that deem themselves quite clever and believe that every answer has a rational explanation. In my travels I have found that those who purport to have all the answers actually have very few.  My suggestion to Mr. Carroll is that he pour himself a beverage and spend another twenty years thinking about what he is thinking about.  Maybe then he will get it right. 
 I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher

 Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course.   First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point.   Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course.   Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again.  The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text.  
 All this book does is tell the same spells over agian that are in the Players Handbook like Ivisibility or wish of Polymorph other so please don't waste your time with this boo 
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 I loved "Diary of a Witch" and was hoping that this book would be just as good and give even more insight.  This book can not compare. It takes away Sybil's validity. She is really quite vain and arrogant,very  self absorbed,and homophobic.  It was a dissapointement and even made my  view of "Diary of a Witch" come down a notch. Much too wordy and  runs around in circles 
 This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter. 
 The sheer number of reviews should alert the potential reader that there is something seriously wrong with this book.   In it, Jack Ryan changes from an expert in foreign affairs, to a bumbling xenophobic fool, who through his negligent refusal to so much as listen to advice on basic psychology or intercultural relationships, manages to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war.  The first 800 pages of the book are a litany of the most disgusting racial vilification that I have ever read, diluted with a mixture of nauseating self-righteous hypocrisy and calls to arm primary school children.  Mr Clancy manages to demonstrate a staggering ignorance of China, its people, culture, language, history, and even geography. The linguistic errors, at least, are somewhat understandable. He would have been too ashamed to ask a native speaker to proof-read the manuscript 
 No wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks, it does not work and the quality is sub par.  I have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst I have seen.  Do not take if it was free.  Garbarge and disappointment await.  I gave one star because you have to, but I would give negitive stars if I could 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 Contains quite a few made up things that would make good analogies, but are presented as facts. Many of these claims aren't sepcifically attributed to any source, although the book has a "further reading" list of about 50 books. The author goes so far as to try to explain in detail how all these things work. For example, the soul is explained to be residing in a cavity near the heart. It explains that the soul passes messages back and forth from the brain via the central nervous system. This essentially means that anyone paralyzed from the neck down has no soul, according to the author. Overall, I found some useful information in the book, though most of it wasn't and it one needs to wade through "facts" to find what's actually useful 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 Dear Animal Collective,  I am mad at you for letting me drive two hours from home to be amongst your smelly patchouli stinking fans. I can't say I was happy when you guys to came out on stage and were completely ridiculous and well.....goofy. I never thought I would experience something that is the closest thing to a hippy rave, that I can think of. I was not impressed by all the crazy vocal effects you guys used. It sort of reminded me of that 16 year old kid messing around at guitar center. I noticed your almost dub/reggae influences...That upset me. I am even more upset by the white boy tribal thing you have going. I noticed that you guys don't sound anything like your albums. I noticed that the subtle things on the albums are exaggerated when played live to the point at where they are unenjoyable. I will have to listen to Sung Tongs again and see if holds up to your crazy live antics. Seriously, I get the feeling your producer saved you. I hope that I can still enjoy your stuff without horrible flashbacks from tonight 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 Please note that this may have been a great book when it was written in 1999, but how any review in 2005 can recommend this book with four stars is beyond me.  A very serious genetic disorder in Cavaliers has become TOO common and is found in all bloodlines.  This disease, which did not become widely identified in Cavaliers until 2003, should be thoroughly researched by anyone interested in acquiring a Cavalier.  It is not in this book.  Go into this with your eyes wide open.  We love our Cavalier and would not trade him for anything.  But he has had major brain surgery at a prestigious university vet hospital, pre- and post-surgical MRI's, and is on expensive medication 3 times daily.  He cannot be walked on a leash because of pain, even with the medication.  If you want "cutesy" information, buy a book.  If you want real information, go on-line.    Added from Cavalier Health on 9/13/2006:  "Researchers conservatively estimate that at least 50% of CKCSs have occipital hypoplasia (or caudal occipital malformation syndrome -- COMS), the skull bone malformation believed to cause syringomyelia. 
 I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).    I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all 
 I've read Ms. Brown for years and keep hoping I'll enjoy one of her latest books as much as High Hearts or her earlier books.  Her snobbish Virginia characters and foxhunting settings have worn very thin.  I believe in southern gentility as much as the next person, but in light of the issues we face today, lauding something like foxhunting as "civilized" seems a slap in the face.  I don't mind the animal antropomorphizing, but I do mind her using that device to justify foxhunting as a sport that the foxes apparently "enjoy", even if she only portrays "no kill" hunts 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 Emotion and Evolution were CD's with a bit of an edge to them.  Her gutsy rhythm section and the simple guitar work on those albums gave her voice room to soar.    I think they were Martina's best work.  The single "Anyway" promised so much, but from what I am hearing on this album, it sounds very over produced.  It has range and polish . . . but no depth  . . . sorry all, but I am disappointed.   I believe she has gotten too involved in the production 
 In this fast world of ours, I just wanted to be able to make a code-breaker, but NO!! I tlked to the guy on the hotline, and he treated me like ****! 
   Maybe I am naive, but I think if a book promises total self-confidence, it ought to deliver.  This book does not deliver.   I admit, any book making these kind of claims would have a tough time delivering on them, but the main reason I am disappointed is that the ideas espoused in this book are hardly original.  Instead, his ideas range from cliche' statements lifted straight from Dale Carnegie ("be a good listener", "let the other guy know you are impressed with him") to the purely metaphysical, such as "whatever the human mind can conceive, it can acheive" (now, pardon me for just a second while I use my mind power to get out of this wheelchair).   For somebody with absolutely no self-confidence, these tips are good to start out with, but for most people they will simply be common sense.  A reader should expect a lot more from someone who has a Ph.D. in the subject. 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 I must say that I do agree with the words of David Nightengale (Saint Paul, MN) that "If you want to know about accident prevention go to the System Safety Society".  The book talks a lot on tight coupling, or dependence, of different parts of systems during different states (DEPOSE, design, equipment, procedures, operators, supplies and materials, and environment), but it all remains very qualitative. Safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches, which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability.   The author does have an attractive style of writing. Especially the presentation on dam failures (the Grand Teton, the Malpasset and Vaiont dam failures) was interesting to read. 
 While this is a brisk read, as a good popular history should be, I am concerned by errors in the text.  One example suffices.  In Chapter 2, Kelly describes the infamous Fourth Crusade thusly: "Venetian authorities offered a group of French Crusaders free passage to the Holy Land, then rerouted the Crusaders east to capture Constantinople."  Wrong on virtually every count.  Then as now, Venetians gave nothing away free.  The Doge and the leaders of the Crusade agreed on a (healthy) price for transport by sea to Egypt (not Palestine).  When the troops arrived at the port, however, the Crusaders proved to be short of funds, and were unable to raise the balance.  Only then were they diverted to the sack of Zara and then of Constantinople as a means of paying their debt to Venice.  See Norwich, "A History of Venice" for the details.  Now, if Kelly can get an episode as well-known and well-documented as the Fourth Crusade so wrong, how can one trust his judgment on other issues?  Especially on such issues as epidemiology, which few readers (myself included) are likely to know much about?  I also note that the author apparently personally responded to one of the negative reviews posted here.  I would rather that he respond to the one that accuses him of plagiarism.  I do hope it's unfounded.    
 SPARE YOURSELF THIS EXPERIENCE!   Much as I adore Gilbert & Sullivan, and could even tolerate The Hollywood Squares quiz show once upon a time, I can't figure out why anyone thought Peter Marshall would be able to contribute to a G&S production.  And sure enough, he couldn't.  In fact, his presence is one of the many downfalls of this production, which include mediocre choreography, a poorly designed set, unconvincing personalities, and some truly bizarre camera work. It's difficult to even sit through this embarrassing production once.  You'll be better off catching a local amateur production.  
 How exactly this film is billed as a comedy is beyond me. I can't remember laughing at this movie. I guess it's a comedy-of manners, but really lacks  wit. I'm suprised to even say that this is a Billy Wilder film. How could  the man who made such classics as "Sunset Boulevard", "Some  Like It Hot" , and "Double Indemnity" have actually made  this movie! A very weak and unfunny screenplay by I.A.L Diamond and Wilder  himself. If it weren't for the fact that there are two star performances by  Lemmon and Matthau, and fine supporting players like Judi West and Ron  Rich, I might consider giving this one star. The story goes something like  this, Harry Hinkle (Lemmon) is a camera man who just happens to be in the  wrong place at the wrong time, see he collides with football star Luther  "Boom Boom" Jackson (Rich). Hinkle's brother-in-law, Willie  Gingrich (Matthau) seeks the perfect opportunity to try and pull off a  insurance scam. Hinkle of course at first is totally against the whole  idea. But when he's ex-wife calls, Sandy (West), to check if her ex is ok,  Harry starts to think, maybe he could win his wife back. All of this seems  like a pretty good idea. You would think that perhaps some laughs could  come out of this. But Wilder and Diamond have something else up their  sleeve. They both completely avoided the comedy and seemed to try to give  the movie more "heart". It seems like they wanted to make a drama  more than a comedy. Which is fine with me. Only I was expecting a comedy.  The story really seems to drag, why Wilder felt the movie had to be a  little over two hours long I'll never understand. He could of made the same  bad movie in 90 minutes. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars, why I don't  know. And was awarded only one, which went to Matthau, for best supporting  actor. One of Wilder's weeker films, and one everyone should stay away  from. ** 1\2 out of **** 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 I have been a subscriber to CGW for almost 10 years.  Sadly, I have to end the subscription now.  It was a very good magazine; but no more.  One reason is that more than half of the magazine are now ads.  The second reason is that the size of the magazine is getting smaller and smaller with the layout that is getting very hard to read.  And the reviews are bad. The reviews don't have a professional kind of feel anymore.  I can't totally blame the magazine. A big part is due to the gaming industry.  There is no good game anymore.  They are all FPS and MMORPG.  Just how many time you can review the same type of games?  One positive thing about CGW is that it now comes with a DVD full of demo.  I think the DVD alone is worth the subscription.  But for me, it is done 
 Painted Bird is on my all time best book list, so after learning that Kosinski had also written about polo--a sport I play & love, I rushed to read it.  However, the main character and the baroque & over-the-top violence of the game and sex with a panoply of individuals who might be found in Joel Peter Witkin's photographs gets tiring, and Fabian always remains abstruse at best.  If Kosinski desired to shock the polo world, he acheived it--see the other reviews by polo players below--and I do have to give him kudos for that, the image of the average upper-class WASP professional, or better yet macho South American, who bought the book based on polo content, reading the sex scenes does make me laugh.  But in the end I'd recommend staying away from this book both from the perspective of a polo lover and Kosinski fan.  There is a great novel to be written around polo, but this ain't it 
 I found the book repetitive and boring.  We were told many things over and over again.  And the set up for the romance with the Reverand is nothing if not ridiculous.  Not interested in reading any more of these for sure.  
 As Hemingway the Zen master said, "Some are hunters, some are not." Several Hemingway scholars have treid to explain EH's lifelong affinity for blood sports (notably Bredahl and Drake's 1990 exegesis of Green Hills Of Africa) -- this "package of Papa" is content to just push whole chunks and raw excerpts of Hemingway onto a marketing skewer without any comment.  Using "hunting" as a marketing criterion forces together the most flaccid posthumous Hemingway and some of his purest fiction and livliest reportage. It's obvious Hemingway wrote about hunting (and fishing) in the same sense the Homer wrote about Mediterranean tourism. Lazy readers may like the way this editor rearranged Hemingway's cabin furniture, but most of the writing actually seem the duller for being re-packaged to a less spontaneous purpose. Sad to see a great prose turned as a license for 'designer books,' and by his own kin. Some are artists, others are not 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 I read this book desperate for ideas on how to deal with night wakings, and I did not find it helpful. The information is very general and is presented in a disorganized fashion. I had to look in 5 different sections  to answer my question, and each only contained short blurbs on the subject.  Almost every page of this book has a box with a tip or answered question,  and although the advice seems sound, the format is distracting and  difficult to follow. I much preferred Ferber's "Solve Your Child's  Sleep Problems". His answers were more concrete and arranged in a  readable fashion. He provided detailed charts to help you manage things  like how long to let a baby cry, how to water down bottles for night  feedings, or change the sleep cycle of an early riser. I also preferred  Weissbluth's "Health Sleep Habits, Happy Child", which offered a  lot of moral support on why it's best for your child to correct sleep  problems early. He also spends a lot of time talking about daytime naps in  detail. And both authors say it's fine to nurse a baby to sleep (as long as  there are no other sleep problems), which for some reason the AAP is  totally against. I would not recommend this book 
 i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant-heavy, top-5 bschool.  this text was recommended for my Intro Cap Markets class (although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class).  i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class.  unfortunately, i found this book to be EXTREMELY painful.  it was verbose, overly complicated, hard to read, poorly organized & full of jargon.  while it is thorough in its coverage of Capital Markets & instruments, i found it to be nearly impossible to read.  esoteric theories & mathematical proofs were introduced with little background, and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp.  but the jargon & vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable ... trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume 4-5 hours of my time.  AND forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets OR assignments. i could go on, but trust me, this book is bad ... UNLESS you already have a good intro & just want to use this as a reference 
 We bought this book for our daughter for her 1st birthday.  We had to take it away from her almost immediately because one of the pages has a sheep on it and she was able to eat pieces of the cotton off of the sheep 
 Not to impressed with this company. 3rd item I have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed. Also the table top had major horizontal cracks. I don't believe they check their quality of their products 
 After reading great books on privelge and gender (see, Privilege, Power, and Difference by Allan G. Johnson), seeing a book like this is a great dissapointment.  The author is still stuck in the narrative she alleges to be challenging.  But, in her defense, it is not her fault; she is simply the product of our male dominated culture.  She attacks others because she is trying to emulate the male power model and rise above the positions of servitude the vast majority of women in our world are still relegated into.  Another sad comment. 
 Eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot. This movie possibly will be owned by many, but remembered by few. James Caan was the only talent that Eraser has to offer. Sorry guys, my wife bought it, I watched it, gave it away and divorced her 
 There are other versions of "The General" available on DVD and any would be preferable to this one. It's picture quality is muddy and the score is simply a washover of everything from "Pomp and Circumstance" to Borodin to Bizet, none of it selected with the slightest appropriateness to what is going on on the screen. True, you can watch it without the sound, but why? Even at this low price, to be avoided 
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 UGH!  These books are horrible!  Their popularity seems to stem from their quality of reading like stories, which is just what they are- stories!  The historical inaccuracy is embarrassing.  I enrolled my daughter in K12 homeschool program, and quickly withdrew her when I learned that they are using this series to teach American History.  What were the publishers thinking when they promoted this tripe?  I feel very strongly that this series is not worth the paper on which it is written 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 Terrible book overall. If you ar a begginer, then run away because samples that do not even compile. If you an average then you should also skeep it because when you find code that compiles, it will not run (GPFs and such). If you an advanced programmer, then you would be upset that most of the book seems to be dealing with too basic of the stuff. As an example I tried to build water example. I spend half an hour first configuring project, so that it would compile, then running it under BounceChecker to discover where it GPFs, and finally getting it to run, just to see some garbage. If I find it on some going out of bussiness sale for 5$ I might buy it (it has some interesting concepts for water and fire), but never for a higher price 
 If you were waiting for Ministry of Sound to ruin Hed Kandi well then here it is.  Thankfully I haven't brought this.  After hearing this compilation it is very clear that Hed Kandi is over.  The only CD that's any good is the 3rd one and that's cause it's full of Hed Kandi classic's which I've already herd a million times....  Don't waste your money.  If you've already brought any Ministry of Sound CD's this year then don't bother cause if you haven't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this.  Reserve your listening time for something worth while.  Quality isn't a word I'd use to discribe this compilation at all.. 
 Not very good for my (beginning) purposes.  Didn't provide enough information about any single topic for me to do anything 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I had hoped this would be a great one as we are big fans of the rat pack and Bing Crosby....but the quality was sub-par.  I know the label says it is done that way on purpose...but I cannot even imagine it looking that bad on tv back when it was originally aired...it looks more like someone backed a tank over it again and again.  Really too bad considering the show was a good one.  The sound quality is much better than the picture and the 3 stars are quite humorous and entertaining.  Hopefully any future episodes would be remastered in much better fashion! 
 Not only is the plot pretty weak, but the writing style is very unlike the older "Cat Who" books. In fact, it doesn't sound like the "voice" of Lilian Jackson Braun at all. In the past I don't recall every other sentence ending with an explanation mark. Nor do I ever recall so many extraneous characters being introduced to readers with no apparent contribution to the plot. In some cases it looks like the copy editor was asleep. Examples: on p. 131, "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran had plenty of dinner invitations" and again, on  p. 140 "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran received many invitations to dinner." I'm disappointed.. 
 There is a review further down this page that is purportedly written by the author. If this was indeed written by the author, he should be profoundly ashamed of himself.  This is what Michael Burleigh has written in the review below in regards to the criticism offered by one of his readers:   "In cyberspace every moron gets a coconut. One big electronic democracy? Many of my US readers appear to need dictionaries. People don't in the fifteen European countries my work is translated into. Nor did I as I wrote the English language. My book is about Europe. Maybe try living there before you presume to comment on it?"  This is one American who has no intention of putting any money in the pocket of someone who holds me and my fellow countrymen in such open and unbridled contempt. And you have to shake your head at the effrontery of the author as he rates his own book with 5 stars 
 The Sharper Image offers a better product which I have been using for about a year but I wanted to try the Conair for a little more "heat." I shaved with the HGM 1 and felt pretty good about it. I returned about an hour later and it had emptied an ENTIRE can of Edge Gel (unplugged) over the bathroom counter top. Go with the Sharper Image product with this little hint: Ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather 
 Sedgwick's character is a perverted boring loser.  Worst book I've ever read--well, almost read.  Talentless.  End of story 
 Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book.  This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration.  This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures. 
 Lea Solonga will always be Miss Saigon. Not putting her on this CD is a crime 
 THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOVIE IS VERY INTERESTING....DONT FALL FOR IT. THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED HAPPEN- DONT GET ME WRONG; BUT IN A PLODDING AND TALENTLESS WAY. THE SUBTITLES MOVE VERY FAST AND INTERFERES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY " SEE " THE MOVIE. ACTING VERY SUB PAR AND STORY NOT DISTINCTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH RECOMMENDING TO A FRIEND OR WATCHING AGAIN 
 I have read the other reviews of this book. All got to say is that I feel that most of them must have read a different book! I not completely new to Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise but I am no expert so I thought the book would  be very suitable for me how wrong can you be. I give you an example Samba very popular application. Can be difficult to setup with the in-built Fedora Firewall. The book chapter is useless in giving you a real tutorial on how to really get the program working it gives you a little bit of information than completel lets you down. This is only an example chapter after chapter are like this. My recommadation if you learning Linux buy an other Red Hat book 
 I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect.  
 I purchased this book because as a David Sedaris fan it was recommended to me by Amazon ("if you like this book, you'll like..."). After reading a few pages I realized that the only thing David Sedaris and Rakoff have in common is their first name.  Sedaris engages his readers and accompanies them on the journey he puts forth in print. Rakoff however, throws his words at the reader and runs away, abandoning the reader in a quagmire of over-thought words and phrases. I'm an educated person, but Rakoff uses words that I've never heard before. You need to read this book with an accompanying dictionary.  There is at least one word per page that you'll have to lookup, even if you're a college professor.  I tried to finish this book, but only made it about  way through. It was too much work, and I like to read for pleasure. 
 This book provides a great overview of all the different ways a DJ can position him/herself in the marketplace. Of course, they leave out the newest opportunities like retail stores, cafes, and restaurants and instead concetrate a lot on being a mobile DJ for parties and weddings. You're way better off getting a book that specializes in one type of DJing and spending your time and money pursuing that 
 I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book.  It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me 
 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 I received a copy of Katie Melua's album and absolutely hate it. She's got a flat voice and her songs are so dragging. Even after repeat listening, I still find her bland. However, good on her for making alot of money for a voice and material as interesting as a glass of table water.  I gave my copy to the local charity shop, good riddance to bad rubbish, very bad.  I would prefer NO STAR but it dont exist, sigh 
 This book champions the case of plural identities & builds on many examples from different histories to highlight how any other way of socio-politico-cultural categorization is or has been misleading.    That & that alone, is the primary message of the book. It is disappointing to read Sen stressing this one basic idea over & over again in different contexts & with different examples throughout this book. Sure, there are ramifications of this one basic idea but they're, at best, common-sensical & Sen does not have any new insight or theory that he builds on.   The text is dry & the style archaic. As in his other books, history has been used selectively to highlight a point, never mind if that event was of any political or social consequence.   If you've read other books by Sen, or you're the kind who takes an interest in socio-economic & political matters, you'll find that this book does little to either sharpen your insight into aspects of our world or indeed build a new school of social analysis.   This book is intellectually sterile.   S! 
 If he were alive to see what Allen did to his Robot Universe, he would strangle the guy. This is a perfect example of why Allen should've stuck to those Little House On The Prairie sequels. The basic idea of Inferno (Just like it's predecessor, Caliban) is the creation of two new kinds of robots: The New Law robots and the No Law robot, and their effect on the society of the planet Inferno. The New Law Robots are freer than the original Three Law robots in Asimov's books, but have their own share of problems; Caliban, the only robot created with no laws, is of course the most free, but is far from human. This is all well and good, and in a more capable writer's hands would have been interesting, but Allen takes his one or two good ideas and throws them in a turbine. I'm sorry, Mr. Allen, but I don't really care about the intimate details of Tierlaw Verick's body, or anyone else's, for that matter. Whatever happened to "don't tell, show" 
 What a waste of time this book is! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason. Save your money 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least.  I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk.  Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost  as much as this glamour life stuff pack did.  This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy 
 I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good 
 The above mentioned alias to my intuition wrote for a local newspaper called THE STRANGER. Sounds like some major a$$ kissing for a hometown band of hipsters (they were featured in a fashionable urban clothing store advertisement I saw recently.) Anyway they were hyped up for a couple a years before signing a deal. Seemed like they never played any shows around here in Seattle. I wonder why... 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook.   Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging "comic" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP 
 I just purchased these in part due to the relatively decent reviews and for the rechargeable aspect, features and brand-name. Took them out to test and really not pleased with the performance. In Florida so mountains and hills are not a major influence in the performance evalution. Also, it was perfect weather. I'm not in an area with high rise buildings, rather outside of town in a mostly residential area. At one mile they began crackling severely with static. At just over a mile-they became non-audible...only the call feature worked. By 1.5 miles-forget it. Full charge, no mountains, no hills, no tall buildings, nothing but a few tree's. Now, I did NOT expect anything near the claimed 14 miles, not even half that. I did expect somewhere between 2-4 mile range in perfect weather...nowhere even near it. On the other hand, the rechargeable aspect is nice, the car adaptor is a great little touch but for the price difference-they barely outperformed the $20 set I purchased as toys for my neice/nephew. Disappointin 
 RACIST.  This word summarizes the book.  It's thoroughly anti-semitic. The author believes in the superiority of the "Aryan Race", and tries promote it throughout the book.  He even refers to black people as savages 
 This book is chock full of photos; so much that it detracts from providing information.  I was trying to use it to replace a leaking shower faucet, but couldn't find any useful info about my setup.  All there was were pictures of valves that weren't mine.  I would like to see more troubleshooting chapters, and more possible fitting/material variations outlined.  For instance I would like to know how to go from plastic to copper to galvanized etc.    Still if you doing a new install and have access to the exact material they use then it is good for that 
 This book says: by Robert Musil's, but it is not. Review carefuly before to be sure it is the one you are looking fo 
 I have been a huge fan of the original "Mad Scientist's Club" since I was a kid.  I continued to re-read it as I grew up and read it to my children.  Needless to say, when I found out that another Mad Scientist's book was coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  None - and I mean none - of the stories reached the level of any in the original.  As an example, The Flying Sorcerer was nothing more than The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake "gone airborne" or The Unidentified Flying Man of Mammoth Falls "light".  My advise is to stick with the original, save your money and skip this one 
 There's no real new ground breaking stuff here.  The wit and eloquence mask work that is rather shallow.  While the language is first rate and provocative, a careful analysis of the factual information presented shows a glaring omission of so many more facts that most of his premises are undermined when viewed in a larger, more realistic context.    The best way to put this in perspective is that this author is  a black man from poor, humble beginnings who's trying to make a case for how it is impossible for blacks to succeed in the very society that has made him into the wildly successful multimillionaire, author, speaker, professor, radio personality he is today.  And the reason is the usual cop-out: it's someone else's fault.  Two stars for wonderful use of language 
 I read this collection of life stories and events with an admitedly negative attitude toward it because of my dislike of the first book of this collection.  Nevertheless, I thought that this volume was even worse than it's predicessor.  I don't believe that this book has any literary value to it at all.  It most certainly didn't make me feel better about my life.  Personally I believe that these events are things that happen to everyone in their lifetime.  Merely reading about them AGAIN had even less appeal to me than it did the first time 
 I recently bought this book, and then promptly returned it. The opening line of the preface is an unclear, run-on sentence, which concerned me right from the start, and the book is generally overwritten, devoid of proper punctuation, and repetitive. As a result, I feel that using this book to teach writing might be like getting your cat to teach you how to swim.  My family did have fun suggesting alternative titles before settling on "Any Child Can Write As Well As Me Do" 
 Talk about selling out to the whims of 21st century secularism... When the word Bible has to stand for something other than the bible, we have lost our way.  Where is the focus of the client in bible counseling? I believe that those seeking help and counseling need the focus to be on their healing, not the dogmatic agenda of the counselor. How is that going to help someone? It makes them more dependent, and vulnerable, to the manipulators of the faith.  Drop your personal agenda, ask your client questions and let them organize their options and plans for moving through their challenges. When stuck, find appropriate guidance on such topics biblically and ask the person to be accountable for their actions. The key to success is listening with a non-judgemental mind 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 I have purchased 2 of these from Amazon, neither worked. I tried buying them from Bed Bath & Beyond, neither worked. This is a horrible company. There fryers are delivered non-working, there sweepers are bad and get recalled if they didnt catch fire. Very poor product development. Better off buying T-Fal 
 I would like to go to the trouble of explaining why, in detail, this is not a good movie; however, since amazon habitually goes to the trouble of deleting my other one star reviews, I will go to no such trouble 
 Just another example of white racist rhetoric!  For a thoughtful analysis of the genesis of this thinking, read Ron Walter's White Nationalism...the truth shall set you free 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
  It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents." 
 While this book does cover composition, most of it is about the history of film and television, and about different styles and genres. 
 This is completely UNAUTHORIZED by the band, meaning there are no interviews with the band, and no music by the band on the DVD.  Features the same 5 band photos over and over, no live clips, and interviews are okay, none with the band.  If you really want a biography on MCR, get "Life on the Murder Scene".  A little more expensive, but has 2 DVD's and a live CD, tons of music by MCR, and interviews with MCR.  This DVD has audio a couple of recordings of the video interviews on "Life on the Murder Scene".  Trivia was okay.  I would not have bought if I would have known how bad it was 
 The corporate fatcats behind NOW are just getting greedy. Gimme a break: a COMPILATION of songs that were previously featured on earlier COMPILATIONS? Sing along with me: "Money money money mo-ney, da da da da da, mo-ney!" 
 This book should be re-titled, "A Collection of Interviews with Leading Product Designers."  I purchased this book, thinking that it would provide some sort of insight into the process of becoming a product designer - the education, experience, portfolio build-up, etc.  Instead I read through eleven chapters of interviews with some of the leading industrial designers, but nothing, really, on "Becoming a Product Designer."  I have taken a few product design classes and have discovered that product design is ineffectively taught  through endless hours of lectures about past experiences of other designers, instead of actually helping to develop the skills of the aspiring designer.  This book was reminiscent of those classes, and thus, i was somewhat disappointed.  However, I gave it two stars because it does indeed have alot of info about other designers and it also does provides some insight into the other branches of product design.  Unfortunately, none of the information actually talks about "How to become a Product Designer.  This book merely describes how other designers decided to choose a career and what their opinions are in product design.  So, if you're looking for an informative book on how to become a product designer, then don't buy this book.  However, if you like reading about other designers and what their experiences are like as product designers, then by all means go ahead and read this book 
 There are too many gaps in this book and I find myself looking for something else to replace or complement it. For example,today is the feast day of Saint Therese the Little Flower and there is no mention of her, which is dissappointing,especially for my homeschooled daughter for whom this book was purchased. She does however very much enjoy the information in this book and would appreciate any recomendations to fill in the gaps 
 While I love Dennis Lehane, his prose his timing and generally his stories; these stories get more and more depressing as you move along.  
 I bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  Money thrown away!!  The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked 
 I agree with the other review, Sony brand VHS tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years.  As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations 
 The name of this book should be re-titled 'A Shark Never Sleeps: Wheeling and Dealing with the NFL's Most CLASSLESS Agent.' This guy is so disgusting I won't bother to give my litany of negative aspects of this book. The only interesting part of this book is that it exposes the ugly side of professional sports. 
 This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9). Most of the music is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time (it reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!). And shouldn't each generation choose the music it wishes to be represented with? 
 This is the French X-rated version of 99 women, directed by Jess Franco. The running time of this feature is 98 minutes, which means that this is probably the longest, least censored version of the film that is available. The story involves a women`s island prison, a sadistic female warden, a lustful male governor, and the young, lovely female inmates. Can you see where this is heading ? There ARE scenes of extreme sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in 1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling (standing-in)for. Just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying. I guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969, but looking at the dumb story, lousy editing, and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective.....this is just a dated curio 
 If you have some respect for your nose, please don't buy these wipes!!! I bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell, but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house!!! and I would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby 
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.  The arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor.  I tried bending them myself, but they always return to their original shape.  Pay the extra money and get a better mat 
 I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous.  Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations  in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the  Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged  ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any  other superpower would do to edge favorably.  What the writers here have  amassed is far-fetched scenarios and conclusions that makes it a good  science fiction if it weren't terrestial based 
 The movie never does explain the bed in the basement? & it does not explain who is seen by Abby sneaking around outside? Movie was going along fine but lacks in that it never substantiates the above two items & their signifigance to being seen in the 1st place 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 My son got this thing for Christmas. What a waste of plastic and money. The capabilities of the thing do NOT match what the box shows, and while you might think it works like a spray brush, it does not. You have to use THEIR sheets to activate the solution it sprays. It doesn't even spray ink, its some kind of glorp that smells bad. Additionally, it says "mess free", bull pucky -- you have to spray so much to get any real color you make a mess just buy the mass amounts of the glorp you are spraying.  I was very let down by Crayola on this product. We have the cutting toy, and it works fine, but this thing is just crap in a box. The proprietary paper, light colors, pre-defined pictures and general weakness of the strength of the colors made me chuck it in the garbage, where it belongs 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it.  Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video.  Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind.  He is the only reason for watching this film.  Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood.  I warn you that this film is not very good.  Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film.  The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward.  If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him.  Otherwise, discard the rest of the film.  This film is really not suitable for people of any age 
 Bush is winning the war on terror?    Who here is sufficiently blissfully ignorant to still believe that?  Iraq has completely imploded--even CENTCOM has acknowledged that we are fast approaching "chaos" and total anarchy there.  Bush's occupation there is effectively at an end.  As for Afghanistan, the military now admits that the Taliban is making a major, widespread resurgance, and now controls much of the country.  Our recent bid to push back at their growing offense ended in failure. In fact, we now only control the capital of Kabul, and that only tenuously.  Of course, Bin Laden still runs free, laughing at those he killed on 9/11.  No, the sad, plain truth is that Bush is not in any way, shape or form winning the war on terror.  This book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era, useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision.  Bush, like those who believed in him, has become nothing more than a very sad joke. 
 I agree with many of the other reviewers about this book.  It's not something newlywed couples should read, and certainly not married couples experiencing intimacy problems.  The tone of the book is very offensive and even anti-sex at times.  It gives you a complex about sex and possibly crossing some "line" which the author refuses to actually draw.  Sex is treated as a selfish thing, and being selfish is a sin.  The book is especially degrading of women and their needs.  For example, it talks about orgasm with a kind of disdain, something "unecessary" that you shouldn't bother aiming for.  It has a kind of "oh, that's overrated" attitude towards orgasm and the female's pleasure in general.  If she doesn't experience it at all or with any frequency, i.e. not satisfied, eh, that's ok, no big deal.  And same for the guy.  Satisfaction doesn't "just" come from orgasm.    The book will ultimately cause you problems.  I can't see it helping anybody with much of anything.  It makes you feel selfish about doing anything and will bind you down with worries and make you feel guilty for trying to find solutions to problems that exist or ones that might come up 
 Hate the voice, it's very irritating and amateurish. The songs are great though- i just hope somebody recorded it 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 I found the this book very frustrating to read. The way it was written in some parts left you scratching your head, even if you re-read it 3 or 4 times. And I've already passed 70-217, the new concepts weren't explain very clearly, at least not well enough for a novice to Design to grasp. However, the most disappointing aspect of this book was that it didn't even have one practice Case study! I mean getting use to the new MS test format is half the challenge. You can study this book inside out, but on test day, you'll be totally lost. Go with Transcenders or even the Sybex book instead 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 "Santa" gave this to my 3-year-old boy for Christmas.  That same day, I was picking up toys before bedtime, and found this strange red rubbery thing on the floor.  Oops, the tongue had already come off the book.  Cute story, but not durable enough 
 Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 I bought this DVD based on the 87 good reviews. There was a one-star rating, but I thought it was an odd data point. I forgot what my HS history teacher told us: 50,000 Frenchmen can be wrong. Frankly, those who thought it was a 5-bagger must have all their taste in their mouths. I also question their sense of humor: there's not much that's funny about this film.  Still, if you are dying to watch a movie, and it's the only thing on TV, go for it, but don't waste your money buying it.  PS. Some of the language is a bit hard for a PG-13 rating. I don't advise watching it with kids.  PPS. The poster artists' immagination never ceases to amaze me. There is nothing in the movie that even comes close to the picture on the cover 
 I purchased this book in hopes of getting the most out of my Bowflex Extreme 2. Other reviewers seemed to really like this book, so maybe I'm way off in my expectations. I've been working out for quite a while and recently purchased a Bowflex in hopes of saving time & money by working out at home instead of the gym. I'm not so sure about that decision now... The author uses this book to tell long background stories about back when he worked here or there. It seems to be long winded information that could be summed up without all the page fill & fluff. The diet plan is a no-brainer - it is such a calorie restricted diet anyone will lose weight on it, with or without the Bowflex. 1200 - 1000 calories a day for women will work no matter what. The before and after photos depict weight loss, but I didn't notice anyone making any kind of muscle gains. He makes the Bowflex sound like a magic wand and it's not. To gain muscle you have to work, and his proposed workouts are laughable. I get more exercise grocery shopping than his "workouts". The exercises demonstrated are fine if you have that particular model of Bowflex, but the book is outdated and not helpful if you own an Extreme or Ultimate. I say save your money unless you've never exercised before in your life and have absolutely no idea how exercise & your body work 
 Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two 
 I don't really like books about older couples, and did not read all of this one because of that, even though I do like Kate Welsh as an author.  Here is the back cover review. For years, Evan Alton had avoided forming ties and concentrated on building his ranch. But now his twin baby grandchildren needed urgent care, and he'd do anything for them...even let Meg Taggert, the one woman who infuriated him as no one else could, stay on the ranch to help.  Lucky for Evan, Meg was there temporarily. Yet as they took care of the babies together, arguments changed to playful banter, and the harshness in their eyes gave way to understanding...and more.  Funny, suddenly matching wits with Meg was making Evan feel more alive than he ever had.  Could he be the one Meg was really sent to help 
 I ordered this the night of the Oscars. I will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy. There wasn't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging. It looks like a bad VHS transfer. I should have returned it, but it would've been more trouble than it was worth. I thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately, in my case, I have to add: buyer beware.  
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain:  Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the LCD screen. I shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so I'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) I always show the subjects their photos after I take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. For further clarification, I'm Asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities.  I run around a lot when I shoot. So the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. I got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where I was, but the second time, I wasn't so lucky. So what did I do? I purchased another one. Not only did I have to purchase the extender, I had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. Another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. I didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, I upgraded to the 30D.  If you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. However, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my Canon Backpack. For some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera.  Another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day.  I guess I'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30D; I'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10D 
 I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this? 
 This book has an interesting title and an interesting cover, but that's basically where it ends.  I am returning this book and I do not recommend that you buy it.  The fact that Walmart also sells it should have been a give away.  
 Just awful-so boring.  All of the stories seem to blend together.  "White man is evil" is the common theme 
 This is a deeply flawed memoir by a German who has yet to acknowledge the responsibility that Germans had for bringing about the Second World War.  The first 48 pages, which is all the memoir that Knell gives us, provides some insight as to what his remembered experiences of March 16-17, 1945.    Had Knell stopped there, this would have been a short personal memoir of life and death in Wurzburg.  But Knell plows on for another 286 pages.  He presents us with an incomplete and idiosyncratic view of aerial warfare in World War One, a history of the development of the theory of bombing, tactical and strategic, during the world wars that is cartoonish in its naivete, and a long jeremiad on the evils of the strategic bombing offensives by the RAF (mostly) in Europe, and the USAAF in the Pacific.  Along the way we are treated to such venerable chestnuts as his contention that the Allies at Versailles paved the way for the ascent of Hitler (did they also pave the way for Mussolini, whose Italy happened to be on the winning side in WW 1?), and that the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 was a pre-emptive strike against Soviet invasion armies massing on the Reich's easter border.    Knell mourns the loss of Germany's cultural heritage, while he notes primly that the Wehrmacht did not shell the cultural treasures in Leningrad during theie siege of that city.  Knell should be reminded that approximately the same number of civilians died in the siege of Leningrad as died in the entire Allied air offensive against Germany.  I hope some day that this unreconstructed Nazi can visit St. Petersburg and drive out to Piskaryovka Cemetery where over 600,000 victims of the Nazis/Germans are buried in mass graves.  Or should he prefer to stay in Germany, I'd suggest a trip to Dachau, Sachsenhausen, or Ravensbruck to jog his memory since he seems to have forgotten how evil the Nazis, and the German state at that time, were.  Was the Allied air offensive justified?  I suggest an affirmative answer, and note that a greater immorality would have been committed had the Allies not done everything in their power, in Europe and in the Pacific, to defeat Fascism, Nazism, and Imperial Japan.  
 This very detailed history suffers from several omissions: 1.  While describing complicated military maneuvers, there are no maps to enable the reader to follow what is happening. 2.  There are no notes to the text despite numerous references to obscure events. 3.  The author seems obsessed with his own erudtion, leaving the reader to flounder amongst the excessive and superfluous details 
 Is Grant Lee kidding? Did he print this off a desktop? It is painfully obvious that the book was barely edited: see the chapter on "odd-sales" for details on Wal-Mart's "prophet margin." I wish I were kidding, but I'm not.  Mr. Lee begins with a noir-esque introduction describing his discovery of the truth behind Bentonville's new airport: it's all for Wal-Mart! He claims his knowledge comes from one Informant Smith, a Wal-Mart executive who seeks to ease his conscience by divulging the deep, dark secrets of the Wal-Mart-Federal Government conspiracy: Project Rollback. Lee insinuates that "Rollback Smiley," the Wal-Mart price-slashing mascot, is named for this ostensible conspiracy and so is "hiding out in the open."   I surrendered after the thrid chapter, my brain no longer able to withstand the unrelenting assault on common sense and reason, never mind fact. A quick review of the remaining pages revealed an entire chapter devoted to a wide array of Wal-Mart "facts" and Mr. Lee's personal political philosophy. The rest of the book has little at all to do with Wal-Mart, save for a few anecdotes from Lee's time on the night shift.  O, I beg you, learn from my error and don't waste a dime on this fantasy. There is nothing the least bit credible to be found between its covers 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.  Paper weight in my min

 This book should be titled: Eugenia Zukerman's Coping with Prednisone.  Ms. Zukerman was on prednisone for 10 months; her sister is a MD with Mass General; they co-authored the book. The book chronicles Ms. Zukerman's experiences while on prednisone, while her sister provides the medical authority.  The book does a decent job of documenting the conditions prednisone is prescribed for, as well as a list of side effects.  However, I don't that many people are really going to care or understand the discussions regarding the different types of prednisone, chemical composition, etc.  For the most part, an individual on long-term treatment of prednisone is not going to find this book useful.  Maintaining a fat-free, salt-free, no foods with yeast, fresh fish, low carb diet for years on end is, in my opinion, unrealistic.   Her experiences with side effects, are very accurate.  But my concern is, she does not provide any good coping strategies for the average person who is holding down a 9-5 job and does not have her financial resources. Many people cannot afford fresh fruits, vegetables, fish, and shiatsu massages.  I strongly disagree with advice recommending not to wax the face because prednisone makes the skin fragile.  High doses of pred will cause hirsutism, or growing of hair, particularly on the face.  As a woman, I cannot think of anything more horrifying than having a beard.  If you follow Ms. Zukerman's advice of shaving, you will have a beard.  I've waxed my face for the past 16 years while on prednisone, with no ill effects.  Lastly, the tone of the book is to white-knuckle, grit-your-teeth and stick it out until you are off pred.  Unfortunately, for many of us, there is no such end in sight. As someone who assists individuals with auto-immune disorders to cope with their disease and treatment, getting people to understand and be willing  to take prednisone is one of the greatest challenges I face.  Prednisone IS difficult to cope with with. However, there ARE  many realistic strategies for minimizing each of the side effects;  none of which are discussed in this book because Ms. Zukerman didn't face long-term treatment with the drug.   My recommendation is, go to webmd and look up the medical side effects, and stay away from this book 
 For some strange reason, I began receiving this magazine in the mail. Never ordered. Never paid for. My conclusion based on reading the last three issues: You're kidding me. How can Time Inc. still publish this rag? What's the point 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 I love Gary Null's radio program. It's so inspirational that I bought this book hoping for more of the same. Sadly, I found it one of the worst organized books I ever seen, badly edited, and full of pages and pages of superfluous "testimonials" (literally over fifty pages of insubstantial fan letters!) I'm sorry to write this because I am a fan of Gary's and appreciate what he does on the radio but I feel compelled to warn the prospective buyer away from this book 
 The question titling this review is the one a potential reader needs to ask prior to choosing this book. The story of this astonishing work of art, gifted by Frederick I to Peter the Great, has been the basis for many books both scholarly and purely fictional. While this book is non-fiction it is not one I would recommend to anyone that is unfamiliar with this topic. The room that is the title of this book can be viewed online as it has been reconstructed, and once seen the viewer has a right to expect a written history of this fantastic creation that both approaches the unique beauty of the art itself and the incredible journey the room may have taken.  The mystery/history of the real Amber Room has all the makings of the most remarkable of fictional thrillers, and while the authors present a sturdy, competent narrative, the book never gets very interesting. The prose is dull and does as much of a disservice to the true tale that black and white photographs do to the real Amber Room.  The book also suffers from a constant handicap of; wishing for something just does not make it so, every attempt at breathless suspense reads as labored, contrived and often very predictable. If you have never read about this topic search elsewhere as the subject is fascinating, if you are already a reader of books on this tale again you should look further before adding this to your reading list. 
 this reduced and illustrated book leaves you very unsatisfied, please buy the  unillustrated version and laugh for hours on end. 
 As "rush to judgment" is the mantra chanted by defenders of the "presumption of innocence" and skeptics of law enforcement, so could "rush to publish" be a criticism leveled at authors who have penned premature books on the Laci Peterson case.  Fleeman's, "Laci - Inside the Laci Peterson Murder," a pulp paperback mass produced by St. Martin's Press in December of 2003, is an accounting of the case from the "disappearance" Christmas Eve of 2002 to the burial of Laci and Conner in August 2003, two months before the preliminary hearing where many clarifying, enlightening and alarming facts would be presented. Fleeman, currently on the staff of People magazine and formerly with the Associated Press, attempts to portray a fairly balanced treatise, based heavily on articles from The Modesto Bee and press conferences, along with selected quotes and opinions from the Peterson family which have not, to my knowledge, appeared in print before.   From this observation, I conclude that the Peterson family was consulted during the research of this book and were compensated for it. Notably absent are statements from the Rocha side that were not derived from previously broadcast or printed media. Whether because of inaccurate sources, ignorance, careless editing, or deliberate spin, the book contains an extraordinary amount of errors.    I am surprised that a professional such as Fleeman would allow this book to go to press without having someone with an informed background in this case proof read it first. To Mr. Fleeman's credit, interspersed as a sort of bucolic relief between recounting the chronology of the grim investigation, a few of his anecdotes about the history of Modesto are amusing. However, Mr. Fleeman's somewhat bland narrative is eclipsed by quotes from the major players in the story, and what few laughs and tears I experienced reading this book were all elicited by Laci or her family, who remain the heart and soul of this tragedy.  Fleeman's main source of information was obviously local news reports generated daily throughout the case by the Modesto Bee, some of which we now know were incorrect in many of the details, based on the flurry of activity and originally accepting much of Scott Peterson's explanations for events as fact. Various recurring descriptions of Peterson "crying, blubbering, incomprehensible," and "focused on the search for his wife," were no doubt contributed by his family, as any overt demonstrations of grief, credible emotional displays, or participation in active searches were nonexistent to the rest of the world. Fleeman relies on Peterson's timeline and other unreliable references for his activities of the 24th, the weather, the number and times of his phone calls, McKenzie's behavior, and Laci's plans that morning.   In his efforts to present Peterson's side of the story, Fleeman traps the defendant in numerous areas of disbelief.   Similar to the articles in People Magazine about the Petersons, Fleeman blatantly misrepresents the clan as "another blended family. Both his parents had three children from previous marriages and, like the Brady Bunch, this brood somehow formed a family when Lee and Jacqueline Peterson got married...He [Scott] was the baby of the family and the joke among the seven Peterson children - five boys, two girls - was that Scott never had to walk anywhere until he was at least age two..." Apparently Mr. Fleeman isn't privy to the fact that Jacqueline's first two children, Don and Anne, were given up for adoption and never met Scott until they were adults; and that Jacqueline, by all accounts was never married prior to Lee.  Other important (or incriminating) details that were omitted in the book include reports of Scott golfing during the searches, visiting the Berkeley area in rented cars only to stare out at the water for a few minutes and leave; and the revelation that a neighbor, Kim McGregor, was responsible for the burglary of Peterson's house while he was in L.A, which were all common knowledge before the preliminary hearing. Curiously, the 8-page photo archive in the center of the book includes no pictures of Laci, not even the ubiquitous "missing" poster. Any biographical information about Laci is derived from her family and friend's interviews with the press and television personalities. If I were writing a book about a murder, using the victim's name as the title, I would make a concerted effort to flesh out her life and history to portray her as a multi-dimensional person, and not merely rely on what has already been written about her.   The philandering and fraudulent Scott, on the other hand, warranted much more illustration, including several references to a golf scholarship to Arizona State that has yet to be confirmed as anything but Peterson family legend.  Regardless of the attempts to swing the anti-Scott pendulum more toward the center, Fleeman's cozying up to the Petersons is glaringly evident in the amount of ink he devotes to their point of view. Besides his propensity to revisit already trampled territory, the author fails to penetrate any source in the investigation on either side, which may be attributed to the fact that most insiders were strictly adhering to the gag order (despite what the defense and Peterson supporters allege), or just didn't trust Mr. Fleeman. After seeing how Fleeman misrepresented some of the salient details that were shared with him by people peripherally involved in the investigation, I'd be surprised if he gets any more opportunities for future interviews with key players (other than the Petersons) when the results of the trial are known and he wants to write another book. Perhaps he should title his next one "Scott. 
 I think I never want to see  Another stanza by A.E.  I pity now the friends of Terence,  And eke his siblings, pets and parents.  For oh, good Lord the verse he made--  Too grim and too much in the shade:  The doomstruck lad, the Severn missed,  The Ludlow fair where he got pissed,  The London blues, the snow-hung orchard,  Young life cut short in syntax tortured,  And favorite of all his themes,  The Shropshire schoolboy's martial dreams.  Brave verse to stop a soldier shirking  By one whose work was patent-clerking.  "Stand up, be brave, lad, if you please,  So poets here may live at ease.  "And we shall rhyme and wring our hands  When you're cashiered in distant lands.  For really, 'tis not bad, the grave--  No care, no pain, no need to shave.  "So blah blah blah by Severnside,   And good for you, young suicide."  Well, he's dead too, now, old A.E.  Arrived where he most longed to be.  What's done is done, some good, much bad,  But still he toils, this Shropshire lad,  Producing yet from under plow  Some wholesome food for Shropshire cow 
 I should have paid attention to the subtitle: "When Science and Religion Merge." Well, they don't. They can't. I can't believe I was suckered.  I'll grant that the "scientific method" and "mythology" are very different intellectual pursuits. I'll even grant they differ in the prism of the world they see. I'll even grant that they offer complimentary perspectives, at least if one accepts polysemy.  But they don't and cannot "merge." The "fairy tale" is that someone believes that they can, namely Rigas. It was there in the title! The scientific method and resurrection of the body cannot merge. They are contradictions! Neither "FITS" the other. What a terrible waste I could have prevented.  I'll look closer in the future. This is my error. I know better, and yet curiosity got the better of me. The subtitle should have been an obvious warning. Curiosity can sometimes overlook the obvious. I have and did 
 The author spends the entire book describing his highly romanticized time travelling with three "gypsies" he picks up in order to follow "the paths" of their ancestors.  Highly speculative, his theories are so fanciful (think "Foucault's Pendulum" style associations) and without corroboration that, while they may be fascinating and interesting 'what-ifs' for people versed in Rromani studies, I am afraid this book will only spread more misconceptions, spawn unrigorous standards in research undertakings and give an even worse name to 'gadje' ethnographers than they already have made for themselves.  He stereotypes various clans and nations to make them fit into his limited perspective of them (i.e. he wants there to be a natisye of "entertainers," another of "tinkers" etc) so as to concoct a hypothetical story of diaspora.  Unless you've read EVERY other book out there on the subject, skip this one.  If you're looking for a good primer, especially as a 'gadjo', go with Ian Hancock's book "We Are the Romani People."  Sadly, Moreau's journey was much more fun for him to live than it is for us to read

 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches "Z" 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame

 I work as a technical writer for a telecommunications company that markets enhanced directory assistance in the wholesale and retail markets. Since my primary audiences are engineers and technicians, I write about and have to understand the technical aspects of how switches, telephony, and telecommunications applications function. About this dictionary (the 3rd edition), though it appears to have many definitions, when you look into it, it's amazing how many concepts it does not cover. For example, it has very poor coverage of SS7 terminology. Further, McGraw-Hill writers don't seem to understand that people often refer to the same concept using slightly different terminology so the dictionary lacks "see also" references. This is an area where Newton's shines. Even if the term is in the McGraw Hill, it's hard to find. I was excited about the CD-ROM, but it's a only PDF file of the hard copy manual. The PDF does not include any search functionality beyond what the book offers itself. The CD-ROM would be much more worthwhile if it took advantage of modern-day help system technology to make an online document with advanced search features and multimedia presentations, neither of which are difficult to create. Overall, the McGraw-Hill dictionary has definitely not been worth its price. If you're looking for substance and ease-of-use, buy Newton's 
 I purchased this camera for my own birthday present last October.  I have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it isn't working.  I paid $400.00 for it last year when it was "new."  The LCD will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after I take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off. I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer.  I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period.  They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00.  I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment.  I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!  Buy a different camera - I wish I had 
 I actually threw this book away,something I almost never do. This author drags together every half-baked story anyone has ever written down and presents it,with no evidence or eyewitness statements, as it is.Do you believe that a pack of evil ghost-dogs prowl highway 666 in New Mexico? Neither do I-but they're here in this "collection." Anyone reading this review could have written a book that would be at least as good as this one. Don't spend any money on this book!

 Can someone seriously explain how and why Betty Hutton became a star?  Her one talent seems to be her volume.  She is entirely without subtlety, sincerity, honesty in her acting and is a mediocre singer.  She merely shouts.  The production numbers are well done and Howard Keel does well, especially since he is playing opposite a fire engine siren.  
 I subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in PDF form. I was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. Frankly I was disappointed. The reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis, (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). Reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... Please. They are also fairly out of date. Most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. Some titles aren't available anywhere that I can figure. Whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find?  My interest is primariy sci-fi, horror and romantic-horror. Most of the titles audiofile reviews are fiction. The articles aren't particularly interesting. Frankly I could care less what the narrator thinks or feels, as long as they have a good voice. There is also a sort of...Literay snob tone to audiofile. I get the feeling they like certain authors and certain titles and tend to overly focus on them.   I'd really like to see audiofile have a 'coming soon' review column. It would be very useful to know what titles will be coming out in the future. I'd also like to see more romance, dark fantasy, and horror reviews, or at least make the section focusing on different genres a little more clear. I also think the sections focussing on children's titles and self-help are a little large.   2 stars. If you must subscribe, get the online version. That way you can cancel anytime, and don't have to worry about subscription problems 
 This book is full of lies, written by people who have no idea what they are talking about. I would recomend that they actually visit this country before they speak about it 
 . . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back.  the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened.  Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive.  not quirky or interesting.  they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that.  and did i mention it was boring?  so mind numbingly boring.  there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting.  i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this 
 I believe that the author of this book should review it. I did not fine any searching in this book. The native people from the rain forest should be let in peace 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 This book claims that Plato wasn't an anti-democrat. Or was he? Actually, the author tries to have it both ways. On the one hand, Sara Monoson admits that Plato had strong anti-democratic and elitist tendencies (you might say that again). On the other hand, she nevertheless wants to "unsettle the orthodoxy" and claim Plato for democracy. It's not working. The method of this book is fundamentally flawed. Monoson points out that Plato shared many of the cultural conceptions of Athens. But that is hardly surprising. Plato was an Athenian, not a Spartan or Cretan. It doesn't prove that he was democratic. Monoson also claims, that Plato's rethoric often derived from various democratic practices. But, once again, this proves very little. Even fascist rethoric is partially derived from democratic ideology, for instance the populist appeals to the people or the nation. This doesn't prove that Hitler was a democrat. (Incidentally, I'm not claiming that Plato was like Hitler. I'm simply trying to make a methodological point.) What makes Plato Plato, what makes Plato tick, is precisely his controversial ideas, including his sometimes disturbing criticism of democracy. We cannot domesticate Plato. We have to wrestle with him as he really was. Friend or foe alike, we're doing Plato a disservice by turning him into a harmless icon.  
 I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists. 
 The 2 young main characters are charismatic but all the secondary characters are caricatures. Even Olivier comes off pretty bad in this (especially his awful French accent! 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I'm more than halfway through this book and I don't think I'll continue any further.  It's more like a medical dictionary of illnesses and diseases rather than a preparatory book for couples who are planning to conceive. A nice title though... but the contents were not what I expected. 
 If you like the music of George Winston's earlier albums, especially the "seasons," December, Plains, Forest, Montana.....you will probably not like this one.  Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works.  I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues.  This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive.  I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his.   
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 I have bought two dust busters in three years.  They do work great for small things like lint and hair, etc.  However at some point within a year maybe a year and a half with little usage (a couple of times a week for a couple of minutes at the most) it will not charge anymore.  You do get what you pay for and I will be buying from another manufacturer 
 you will be not successful in Amway without truly understand what Amway/Quixtar means to our lives. The system is a fair system which is backup by lines of good quality products and service. Please can you name another company is as generous as Amway for satisfaction guarantee? it is a win-win business for line of sponsorship, and your customer is also a winner for using the quality, enviromental friendly and cost effective products. The author has not really been into Amway business and has no rights to make such judgement which is unfair to Amway and it's IBOs 
 The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.  I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech 
 BUT, do not buy this.  I did not take the advise of the other reviews and bought it anyway, thinking they did not understand his comedic genious.  I am such a fool.  His first "Best of" is fantastic!  This was just more of the first disk (honestly, half of the disk was more of the same skits!!)  and a rather failed attempt to give you more cow bell.  I hate to write a bad review, but save your money and your time.  
 I thought I would like this book, as I am very interested in the topic. But it was not practically useful at all. The information was overwhelming. I am not going to write down 55 different ingredients, each one 32 letters and numbers long, on a list to take every time I go shopping. You're better off just trying to buy natural products in general, than to try to get anything useful out of this book 
 Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.  (... 
 Well the other reviewers covered everything but 1 point,...the box is marked Anamorphic Widescreen,....it isn't. It is the only Tartan Asia Extreme that is '4/3 letterboxed' that I have run across. I own many. Most are excellent. This one isn't,.. AND won't work on you widescreen TV. They have the subtitles in the black above and below the picture so you can't zoom the picture to fill the screen. You will have to watch a little picture centered on your big widescreen TV. I called Tartan to report the error and the customer service guy said,.." Well,..what do you want me to do about it. I just work here and everyone else is at lunch. 
 The video is geometrically distorted, interlaced, has blown out contrast, almost no detail at all, and horrible sound. TransFlux Films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work, yet including a featurette on the cover designer.  Everyone should avoid this DVD and go for the BFI double feature with L'Age D'Or, which has a watchable Un chein andalou for a change. 
 I enjoy reading and listening to Ravi...however, if one is serious about theology and apologetics...this is not the book.  There are many who have written down to Ravi concerning this work, and some of their comments may be warranted.  What may be at point here is not that Ravi has some solid interior insights, but rather the presentation of his philosophy/faith.  As an avid student of theology and apologetics, I found his book at a loss for deep penetration.  Many Protestants in particular may find profit from the book due to their inclinations and history of anti-intellectualism and subjectivism of interpreting Christ, but there are Catholic theologians whom address the ideas of this book in a much deeper and real sense.  I doubt many who have reviewed this book have read a St. Thomas Aquinas, who took Aristotle's works and lofted them to the heavens.  St. Aquinas is but one of the great Catholics who have wrote of the One true God.  One reviewer had the impetus to quote the Catholic Encyclopedia...I challenge this reviewer to read some of the great Saints and see if he or she still thinks Hinduism/Buddhism are on par with Catholic (Christian) beliefs of God.  Do not be taken in by pop/new-age pluralism...their followers are as Thomas Merton writes "Birds of Appetite".  Ravi is on track, he just may have wrote to a common denominator that deep seekers are beyond in their present state.  
 I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash 
 There was a time when I would buy anything with Jeph Loeb's name on it.  At the time this book was being written, Jeph Loeb had already worked with Tim Sale to produce "A Superman for All Seasons" (the inspiration for Smallville), and "Batman:  The Long Halloween."  Jeph Loeb had established that he KNEW these characters.  He seemed born to write them.  But all was not well when wrote Batman: Hush, the story leading into this one.  He still had a wonderful handle on the character, but his great mystery (Who is Hush?) was formulaic and predicatable.  At best.  It was cluttered with too many characters and was painfully episodic.  At this time he was following up the terrific first two season's of Smallville with the somewhat lack luster Season 3 of Smallville.  Then came Batman/Superman and Smallville Season 4.  One has to ask, did Jeph Loeb have a blood clot form in his brain?  Batman and Superman work to take down President Luthor after Luthor declares them outlaws because a giant kryptonite meteor was headed to Earth.  ...  Wait ...  Superman, the most significant figure in human history since Jesus ... is a bad man because a piece of a homeworld he never saw is going to hit the Earth?  And isntead of rallying all the Superheroes on Earth to stop it... you send them after Batman and Superman?  Hard as it is to imagine, it goes down hill from here.  Luthor is the perfect villain for Superman.  He is evil, and equally powerful, but fragile.  He is the epitome of the Superman conflict.  Superman has all the power of a God, and sometimes he just can't stop evil.  He can't save everyone with his powers.  One of the major themes of Superman is that some problems can't be punched.  Some problems must be faced as a man rather than a Superman.  Loeb appeared to understand this, and was the very man who made Luthor President.  The American chose the man who respresented everything Superman found evil and wrong to control the country he loved.  Superman felt betrayed.  The paralells to Bush are striking, but as Luthor's rise to President was written well before the Novembor 2000 election, pure coincidence.  SO here we are, Batman/Superman.  Several DC story arcs were leading up to Clark Kent doing what Superman couldn't.  Using truth and the media to take down a man that Superman couldn't touch.  THIS is a theme that DC comics needs to embrace.  If they want to reach a more mature audience, a greater focus needs to be put on Clark.  Superman gets the people in capes, Clark gets the people in suits.  And as the story arcs build up to what could be the best Superman story written in a decade-- Jeph Loeb decides to have Luthor just GIVE UP EVERYTHING and inject himself with LIQUID KRYPTONITE and get in a giant robot and go fight Superman in front of national television.  Paging Mr. Loeb, we've discovered that you are a hack.  This of course ignores many of the other terrible aspects of this story.  This review is getting long.  - The homoerotic tension could be cut with a spoon.  I have no problem with gay super heroes.  Superman and Batman are tow of my favorite heroes and I lvoe their interactions.  But this isn't two budies facing certain death.  It's two gay lovers taking down the entirity of the DCU in issue after issue of uninspired dialogue and terrible story. - the world is ultimatly saved by a giant half batman half superman anime robot flown by Captain Atom.  We are meant to feel bad because he is going to die.  Only he can't.  It's impossible.  eVery time his suit gets ripped open he just gets thrown into the future.  And that happened again of course.  So why should the reader care? - Being shot with a kryptonite bullet apparently does nothing more to Superman than make him a bit quesy.  It's amazing how one can across comic books and Smallville track how the shining star of comic book authors went from a man who could reach his readers on a profoundly emotional level to a man who appears to be writing for little more than a paycheck 
 I don't see how you can isolate "The Grand Inquisitor" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov.  I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this.  It's excellent 
 Well, we ordered this for a trip and it's "delayed" even though it says it's in stock.  We got a vauge email that says "delayed" but no promise of delivery.... don't order it from Amazon if you're exhausted chasing an escaping baby!  Go to a local store and purchase it........waiting.......waiting.......waiting...... 
 I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games 
 This book should be title "in the mist of opium", Swain admitted that alot of his writting was done during the drug induced moments,  including his report of American bombing of Kampuchea. What is not cover  here is how Swain convinietly ignore the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge and  his portrait of them as "valiant" fighter against a corrupt  Western-backed regime. Swain like many of his fellow  "journalists" at that time, was siken of the war and tries to  actively end the war by painting a bleak picture about the non-communist  and glorified the Marxist forces. Unfortunately the death of over 600,000  Vietnamese Boat People (as estimated by the UNHCR, 250,000 Vietnamese  "Corrective Labor Reeducation" slaves and several millions Khmers  prove that sometimes "Peace at Any Price" is worst than war, if  the evil side wins 
 This is yet another book where anyone who passed a high school bio class will know is crap. [...] he seems to have found a devoted crew of morons who believe that he really can cure all.   If you ever go to one of their conventions, you'll know that its AMWAY for stupid soccer moms with allergic kids.  
 I had been looking forward to reading this book. First of all, I do believe that the HSP trait is a distinguishable trait. I myself have started to discover and do some research into the subject. I have no doubt that Dr. Elaine Aron is an HSP herself and her book has helped many. Maybe I was born too late or something or just my natural tendency to not put too much value into self-help books in general. Maybe it's a GenX thing, I don't know... but I think the root of it may be my general disdain for the psych "establishment" as it exists right now. They have pretentions of "open mindedness" but I really do believe a great majority of them have this "happy psychologically well-rounded medium" that they ALL seem to want to drive people toward, regardless of how many paths there are up that mountain to get to that point. I fear Ms. Aron, with her PhD credentials, has fallen into this trap of not being able to think outside the "psych box", so to speak. My biggest complaints about this book are:  1. her dismissal of the word "shy" and "shyness in general". (see below) 2. her over-insistance on psychotherapy as the cure of everything.  3, her over-reliance on childhood experiences as the ultimate factor in just about everything related to HSPness. A side note to this complaint is she seems to think childhood experience is at one of two extremes: either blissfully wonderful and magical in every way or horribly dysfunctional and wracked with trauma and just plain awful in every which way (of course requiring years of psychotherapy to get over!--sorry, I can't help being sarcastic!). I would think that most people's childhoods, whether they are HSP or not, would fall somewhere in middle, don't you think? That would be where mine falls.  4. Generational and socioeconomic complaints: This book, like many other self-help books of this type seem always geared toward overly-affluent suburban Baby Boomers. As a struggling GenXer male who hasn't had a six-figure income to escape from and find out that life is more important than making money, (sorry, sarcasm is too ingrained...it's a GenX thing!)I just feel so disconnected to this type of thinking that prevails in most self-help books of this type (which is why I mostly avoid them!) Aren't there HSPs who AREN'T age 45-60 females from New York or San Francisco?(where this author divides her time) out there who have a perspective to say? (Hmmm, maybe I should write it myself!)  I'll address these complaints briefly in depth. As someone who has both been called "shy" and have called myself that for as long as I can remember, I have no problem with the label. Granted, we should not let our labels BECOME us, but if there's something that fits and is not derogatory, why not? Frankly, what's wrong with "shy", Ms. Aron? I respect your view on it, but I disagree. I don't think "shy" is an inherently negative description. I'm mystified as to why you think every introvert should shed it.   I guess I wish this book had been written by an HSP layperson instead of a clinical psychotherapist who is stuck inside the box of that school of thought. That would make it seem more like it was written by a friend and not a shrink who has to keep their occupational distance from you. This is a highly emotional (and sensitive!) subject for us HSPers, so I dunno...maybe my response is just a natural reaction of my type. Who knows? Psychology is an inexact science to begin with, anyway.  So basically, it was a frustrating disappointment to read this book. I'm giving it two stars only because it at least was groundbreaking in it was apparently the first book to try to identify and distiguish this specific trait. It deserves credit for that at least.  
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 Coleman's play on different instruments showed a lot of skill, but the music seemed to lose some of its spontaneity in the process.  The jazz represented to me a kind of neo-be-bop that lacked lyrical luster and moving harmonies.  jw 
 Tiny print. However, there is lots of empty space.  Try DESIGNING A PHOTOGRAPH instead.  Most disappointing purchase.       
 The problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real "know-how" methods.  Similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges, this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight, skills, and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs.  I would not waste your money on this book at any price.    If you want a great book on the topic, I highly recommend "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs".   This little-known book is rapidly becoming THE STANDARD for entrepreneurs.  
    I was reading the reviews for this book, both 11th edition and 10th edition, and was surprised to be the only reviewer that disagrees with the quality of this book. The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably.       The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey "down home" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered.       In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook. If you enjoyed "The Worldly Philosophers" by Robert Heilbronner, you'll like reading this book. But to use it as an Economics textbook, BIG MISTAKE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST TEXTBOOKS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY COLLEGE SUBJECT OUT THERE.      I give it an F or 1 out of 5. 
 This is an anemic collection of Jimmy Dean's Hits.  The copy I purchased online is made by Bear Family Records which cost [quite a bit] for the CD, however, it contains a total of 26 songs like "Gotta Travel On", Please Pass The Biscuits, Walk on Boy, Make The Water Wheel Rol, Dear Ivan, Sixteen Tons, and others.  Now, here's the real kicker -- The label of the CD is made to look like a (circa 1950s) 45-RPM single with the dark red label with gold lettering and even has the record grooves including the runout groove used to trip the changer mechanism.  Where the "Columbia name would be is the name "BEAR FAMILY".  Bear Family Records also did a Guy Mitchell CD and duplicated the late 50s Columbia label look with the red & black squares.  Bear Family Records cost a little more but they really do a pro job with no skimping.  This CD is a BIG disappointment, they could have done better. In fact they SHOULD HAVE done better 
 This CD is remixed and edited to the point where most of the songs are choppy and the music drowns out the voices. This happens especially with Tony Braxton's Unbreak My Heart - though this is one of the most enjoyable remixes.  Also, there's a monotone quality to the rhythm and flow that becomes tedius quickly.  I expected to find Duran Duran's Sunrise to be simply a toss-in filler, but it's quite good. And Dido's White Flag is wonderfully done- though cut a bit short.  The remainder went under "Disable Selected Tracks" -- a lot of divas caterwauling through some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever had to struggle to hear. Alice Keys featuring Tony! Toni! Tone'! and Diary reaches new highs for repetitive drivel.  A waste of money.      
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 This book is a clear example of a teenager's trying too hard to sound world-wise and blase.  It's a book about detachment and nothing, in which rich kids do nothing but take drugs and sleep together and can't even muster up the effort to drive their clearly especially drunk friend home.  Ellis, however, can't let the theme of detachment be subdued and understated, which might have made the book much better; no, he has to hammer it in constantly (for example, two characters decide to have sex but don't even touch each other).  Even worse, he doesn't write very well.  He seems to be trying to sound like Hemingway quite frequently.  Hemingway's long, unpunctuated run-ons, though, are elegant and hypnotic.  Ellis's are just bad.  He goes through different styles, too, seemingly trying to imitate other great writers and sounding only like a kid who hasn't figured out how to write like himself yet.  Appropriate for an eighteen-year-old writing from the point of view of an eighteen-year-old?  Maybe, but it's terrible writing and not worth the effort it takes to read (which is not much).  I am not criticizing the book based on its disturbing themes (drug use, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, gang rape, violent pornography, and prostitution).  Done properly, this novel could be a fascinating and eerily disturbing book.  The problem is that it isn't well written.  We read this book junior year of high school, and I can honestly say that it's the worst book we read.  There's just nothing to it.  It's not a book; it's words on a page, and even more they're the wrong words awkwardly strung together 
 This book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader. Both my child and I felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects. Trying to find information about Da Vinci's life proved elusive. There was no infomation on his childhood, but most  glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician  or astromner.  The focus was on his artistic ability, yet there were few  pictures of his most famous works. The book did provide infomation, but in  a rather boring and cluttered manner. This book is satisfactory as  secondary reference. My child, an avid reader, did not enjoy this book. He  said it was not for kids 
 This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions 
 Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.  Anyway, Mr. Bungle.... tepid.  Uninteresting.  Bland.  Stupid.  Gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over.  Let them.  Someone's got the fuel the economy 
 This magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than $100 on babya outfits, etc.   It is not a magazine for most of America, but rather for the elite, or those who wish to pretend they are.   There are way too many ads, and insignificant articles.   Parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category. 
 I am black American and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (Crème of Nature, TCB, Dark & Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is "on sale" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)  I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.  It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark & Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair 
 I was very upset by this book. I stopped reading  it after three chapters. Norman Mailer is a deeply disturbed, dirty old man. The book had less to do with Hitler than with Mailer's bizarre imagination. While no one would dispute the fact that Hitler was a horrible man, Mr. Mailer mind seems to dwell in a sick and twisted world. This book does nothing to enlighten us. It is demeaning to the human spirit. I benefited not at all and felt that if I had continued reading I would be "dirtied". 
 Was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting, indepth coverage, etc.  Then, starting about 1-2 years ago, the magazine started to take a "left" tilt.  (I do not consider myself "right wing", am registered as an independant, but do like fair balanced coverage in my news)  Since the beginning of this decline, the Atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine.  The bias has also led, as it always does, to less in-depth reporting, since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent. 
 I love Jim Lehrer's news program, and I had heard that he was a prolific writer, and I am a passionate student of Civil War history, so you can imagine my delight when I saw this book for sale at the giftshop at the Antietam National Battlefield, having just visited Burnside's Bridge. The cover blurb was fascinating, the story looked fun -- and the book is 10% off at the park!  Alas, I must add my voice to the chorus here. Mr. Lehrer ain't no Hemingway. The story begins well, then rapidly begins introducing one-dimensional characters and implausible plot twists. I finished the book wishing that the story had ended a chapter or two earlier.  A final comment: if Mr. Lehrer wanted to deeply address the subject of futile infantry charges, ordered by incompetent commanders and made inevitable by gaps between technology and tactics, there are far better historical places where he could have done so -- all within easy reach of Mr. Lehrer's home in Washington. Frederickburg and Cold Harbor come to mind, but I'm sure there are many others 
 I never thought that a thriller could be boring, but this one is. The characters are unsympathetic (especially the heroine; I would have expected to feel sorry for a survivor of sex abuse, but this woman gives me the chills); the plotline feels contrived.... I had to force myself to finish it 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 It all depends on who you are if you will like this book.  Republicans will like it but Democrats or people with brains won't. 
 Hi, First of all, I love this band , and think it is one of the hardest working Rock Band. I bought it last month here in Brazil. The DVD was oficialy released here in Brazil as a 3 disc NTSC edition. The first thing a noticed is that there are two concert discs, one for 5.1 and the other for stereo. It's strange, i do not know why they did this way. Two disc for sound options only?? Strange!! I do not understand how the sound could be so bad. I think a lot of money was spent to make this DVD, but the sound is thin, with no BASS, and no punch. The 2 chanel version is a litle better. The Edit - It is very hard to watch the entire show with this fast editing. The edit is too fast, much faster than the Rock in Rio DVD. I just could not watch this show, IHO. They should re-edit the video, and re-mix the audio, and give it free to people who bought it. The Rock in Rio is a much better DVD. T Buy it instead.  Antonio Souz 
 It's a clever concept and yes his prose is a bit florid, but generally entertaining.  Yet, the execution leaves much to be desired.  There just isn't much in here which is new or groundbreaking.  Also, I've been a professional ancient historian for many years and I have never seen a classicist with more venom towards Hector's character.      
 My wife has me addicted to his television program Everybody Loves Raymond, so when it was approached to listen to his stand up on a very long car ride, I thought it would be of some humor.  Boy, was I wrong and the car ride suffered for it.  It isn't that Romano isn't funny, it is the sub-par quality of the CD.  Listening to it for about twenty minutes I could only hear about three of his jokes.  Either he wasn't standing close enough to the microphone, or the company that published this release didn't spend the time to correct the sound.  I didn't get past the twenty minute mark as nothing was making me laugh and the jokes that I did hear were average.  Nothing much to write home about, but I would borrow a friends before buying this one just to check the quality of the sound.  Grade: ** out of **** 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 this is a little set of five pets that is going outragesly high for forty five dollers!!!!!!!! I saw a set at toys-r-us that had seven pets and it was going for five ninty nine!!!!  toys-r-us did not have any set that expensive unless they came with a playhouse!!!  shop there or at wal-mart or somting, but do not waste you money on this!!!!                            sighned,                              Anne Age 1 
 I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered.   I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.  If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there. 
 What happened?  Her previous book, "The Last Life," was terrific.  The two short novels in this [price] book (big type, too) are awful.  They read like five-finger exercises at a third-rate MFA program -- all characterization, no action or development.  Omit, but buy The Last Life -- it's great.  Hope the author's next will return to her previous level of excellence 
 Empty Fortress by Bruno Bettelheim was just another example of the ways in with Bettelheim fabricated evidence, to further his own view that autism is the result of a Freudian 'wish this child was dead' belief at the conscious or unconscious level.  It should also be remembered that he produced this book to justiy his lack of reports on the progress of a project he had been paid an enormous amount of money to undertake.   Nature versus the environment; a valid debate in any area of human science, but this manifestly corrupt contribution is of historical value in much the same way that a fake Da Vinci is.  Looks good, until you scratch the surface, with anything like decency or common sense. 
 If anyone would visit Dallas, Texas and the location where JFK was shot, you realize just how much disinformation has been written on this subject, especially this screen play. I found the entire screen play just a fatasy  of paranoid exploitation by a profiteer claiming to sell the truth! For  example, the grassy knoll is less than 30 feet from the road way, with an  easy 10 second slow jog, up a knoll about 3 feet high from the road way, to  the fence on the Grassy Knoll. If shots came from there it was easy for any  policeman to run to that area, let alone see anyone tryimg to shoot from  such an open area. Even a quick getaway is not as easy as this screen play  makes it out to be, since you can preview the entire parking lot for over  100 yards. Also, the distance from the sixth floor to the road is far  closer by observation that anyone can imagine, except for Oliver Stone.  These easy observable locations makes the Warren Report much more accurate  than this screen play. Also, the people who benefited by JFK's death was  the Democratic Party and its leadership not any right wing Republican  radicals? Johnson won overwhelmingly and the Democrats took even a stronger  positions in the House and Senate. Moreover, to support such a screen play  based upon the past reliability of the author in biographies that are  suppose to be real stories about real people is another reason to doubt its  integrity. Again, another example I can cite here is "On The Fourth Of  July" where Ron Kovic was beaten and thrown out of the 1968 Democratic  Convention, not the Republican Convention. What few know is that Oliver  Stone was a delegate to the Democratic Convention but this fact permits him  to change facts in this film based on poetic license. So be it, but such  behavior cannot be construed for the truth by a truth teller. The same for  this screen play, it is a great work of intentioanl fiction meant to poison  the minds of the reader to reasonable, objective and available facts, and  does it very well indeed, If the public prefers to remain blind, so be it!  Some will say these are stupid stories for stupid people, others will say  it is a great tale but please remember it is just entertainment. Well, this  screen play is a very entertaining story but please don't call it a book of  facts, truth and accuracy. It is a very good fable as well as the film 
 You have to be suspicious when a manufacturer blames YOU when their product fails to perform. Such is the case with the SkipDoctor.  I used this product on 6 discs, 2 of which became unreadable after cleaning. (They worked before I cleaned them) That is a pretty rotten percentage if you ask me. I contacted tech support and was told repeatedly that I was doing it incorrectly. So I decided to try my own route at fixing the 2 bad discs; I used auto rubbing compound.  It made the discs shine like glass and most importantly, they work again. A $5 bottle will clean about 500 discs. You do the math. All my discs look like new and are working just fine now. Skip the Doctor! 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed 
 The book is ok.  Its well written, and raises some valid points, however the issue is presented almost totally in an 'America-vs-Islam' context.  The main conflicts Qureshi deals with involve post 9-11 America v certain parts of the Middle East and Israel-Palestine.  Qureshi has missed a major oppertunity to investigate other conflicts which involve Islam.  Why does he not discuss Kashmir, Chechnya, Southern Thailand, Timor, Ughur/Western China?  All of these conflicts have a religous dimension to them, and all of them are often talked about by Radical Jihadists, yet none of them really involve the US or Israel.  His lack of attention to this means his book has just become another generic study which simplifies the whole issue.  Overall it is an ok book, and from an academic point of view it does provide an alternative to Huntingdon's theory.  But sadly it has a narrow scope and leaves too many crucial questions unanswered 
 My son is a Junior in High School and brought this 5th Edition book home last week.  I spent an hour going through this book and I have to tell you that I am disappointed in the content.  It lacks historical information and focuses on Social issues.  I want my son to know the historical information behind these social issues.    It is sad that so much of our history is no longer being taught in our schools in favor of diversity 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 I turned this movie on one morning and was glued to it for 30 mins because I just knew it was a joke! WHM spoke as if he were on an infomercial, and the actress who played the student was no better.Knowing now that it was based on a play makes perfect sence. Plays hardly ever translate to good films! The acting in a play is just totally different, overly dramatic, not believable.  Sorry, I hate to write a review based on 30 mins in the middle of a movie, but I purposely researched the title of this one so I could warn others off. No, actually, DO watch it! I want you to see for yourself how awful it is!  and I like W.H. Macy 
 The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec, and The Inflammation Syndrome by Challem, both appeared in 2003 and both discuss the role of inflammation in the major diseases of our time, and the things that one can do to limit the risk of diseases related to inflammation.  Both books are easy to read.  Which to choose?  According to the prestigious Library Journal, "While Jack Challem's The Inflammation Syndrome covers similar ground [to the Inflammation Cure], his approach leans toward the faddish and sensationalist, while Meggs takes a more levelheaded approach, weaving the latest research on various diseases into a broad picture."  The thing I most prefer about Meggs' book is that it takes a comprehensive approach (including diet) to the things that affect inflammation, rather than spending the whole book just discussing the role of diet as is done in Challem's book.  Challem is a health reporter who writes and publishes The Nutrition Reporter newsletter; it is natural that he would stress diet and its consequences.  But diseases are caused and controlled by much more than our diet.  Meggs is a practicing physician who has a great deal of clinical experience with all aspects of inflammation, and who has woven many real-life cases into the book as illustrations.  So, which book should you buy?  I have little doubt that you will find The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec more informative and much more useful as a reference on your shelf 
 Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see 
 This book's premise is fundamentally flawed. The authors try to promote the use of shark cartilage to cure cancer, but they use bad science. In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get  cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous  for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need  traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for  their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money 
 The story is OK, but this book is riddled with technical errors.  A few examples:  Submarine dolphins worn by enlisted personnel are silver, not gold which are worn only by officers.  The captain of the boat (not ship) would not address an enlisted man as "Mr."; that mode of address is reserved for a senior officer to a junior officer.  A yeoman would not be making notations on a navigation chart, as depicted in this book; that is done by quartermasters.  A Tomahawk missile was said to be traveling at 550 mph, or Mach 7; since the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 761 mph (Mach 1), there is something wrong here.  And the list goes on and on to point of distracting this reader from the story.  The author should have had better technical input and proofreading 
 Brought this item for my grand-daughter, it didn't work, Wasn't worth the time to send it back. Won't order from amazon agai 
 I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as  on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back. 
 I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating.  Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well.   There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual. --customisation of the front screen is do-able. --there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it. --Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.   --The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.   -- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume 
 "Micah" was a big disappointment to me.  Unfortunately, in this book, Hamilton has proved that, yes, she can write straight porn!  The story line is minimal and undeveloped.  If sex is the reason you read the Anita Blake series, then go ahead-- you'll love it.  I felt nothing but disgust(with myself-- I read it to the end looking for some redeeming feature.  Alas.) 
 I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only  imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch  of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I  got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free  Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt  dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a  grant 
 I am a studant of gardnerian wicca and I like when elders says: "keep wicca traditional". this is a book of recipes, another one book of a ecletic, self-initiated "wicca" (or witch, or reclaiming, whatever). Is poor in poetry and in rituals. I only take 5% useful from all this pages. I consider this book the same fluffy wicca started by Scott Cunningham. For youngs who want start in practice of wicca, very well, but only for start as curious and a dedicant, this can't show you what wicca really is. It is a joke to sincere seekers, is an outrage to elders 
 As a raw foodist, I hoped this book would help me sort out fact from fiction about cooked vs. raw, providing me with ammo for the many food critics I encounter. But Joe Alexander, in an extremely clumsy writing style, not only made the book a challenge to finish but often diverted from the subject at hand. I'm sure Tibetan rejuvenation exercise rites are valuable as are rebirthing breathing techniques, but that's not what the book title suggests 
 I was very unhappy with the mp3 player. I got my music to download onto just once and every other time it said that the downloads were complete and when I disconnected it from the computer it said empty files. 
 Why do you you insist on portraying all Visitors as wide-eyed peace-loving simpletons?  This book is amusing in many ways (like, what is a CPA and why would a CPA write a book about something she clearly has made up?).  Nonetheless, this type of liberal "why can't we be friends" propoganda merely assures that your planet is destined for destruction.  Why is it that you earth-dwellers will be the only ones surprised by that event 
 What a disappointment.  I cared nothing about the charecters, and the plot never showed up. If you want to read about the government, pick up Clancy 
 I have read this book (and its companion volume) a couple of times, and to be honest I am not a fan.  Many of Jan Fennell's suggestions are useful, but none are original.   Ms Fennell's method is based on the idea of using the non-violent language of the wolf pack to put your dog in his rightful subordinate place, and therefore gain his understanding and cooperation.  Alpha wolves eat first - so Ms Fennell has the dog owner eat dinner before his dog.  Alpha wolves take the pack out hunting - so we are bid to walk our dogs daily.  Alpha wolves aren't demonstrative - so we are told to ignore our dogs for five minutes each time we arrive home from work.  These suggestions are sensible, but they are hardly revolutionary.  Maintaining dominant status by behaving like an "alpha" wolf is a technique that has been championed by many other authors - the only difference is that Ms Fennell gives this process the cutesy name of "Amichien bonding".  The technique is a good one for restoring a relationship with a dog that has been spoiled or confused in the past by weak or misinformed owners. Its success lies not only in the owner mimicking canine behaviour, but also in the institution of house rules and a predictable daily routine for the dog.    So what is wrong with this book?  The first fatal flaw is the unrealistic simplicity of the method.  Ms Fennell seems to believe that all canine behavioural problems are caused by the dog wishing to be alpha.  It is certainly true that a dog with a misplaced sense of his own importance will probably become a problem dog.  However, dogs can also behave badly for a plethora of other reasons - poor training, learned fear, boredom, health issues, confusion and inherent high prey drive, to name just a few.  Ms Fennell's insistence that all canine problems are dominance problems that can be cured by "Amichien bonding" is unfortunately just not realistic.       For a professional dog trainer, Ms Fennel also displays a rather disturbing lack of knowledge about several dog breeds.  At one point she states that it may be impossible to fully train Bull Terriers "and dogs of this type" due to their inherent "savage natures"!  One gets the impression that she has been unable to train this type of dog herself and holds a grudge about it.  Whatever the reason, I find it somewhat disingenuous of her to ignore the fact that other trainers have managed to train these breeds to very high standards, and blame her own failure to do so on the dogs instead of on her own methods.  In short?  If you know very little about dog behaviour and have a mildly pushy dog, then this book isn't a bad buy.  Certainly, applying the "Amichien bonding" advice won't hurt.  It is the same type of programme as recommended by dog behaviourists the world over (you can get much of the same information for free on the internet, from Shirley Chong's website for example).    However, Ms Fennell's book is not a comprehensive guide to solving every dog's problems.  If your dog has moderate to serious behavioural problems, save your money and book a consultation with a professional behaviourist.  Your dog will thank you for it.

 This book is supposed to give an informative view on Strategy.  It doesn't.  It is difficult to read and follow, and is poorly structured.  It is also very very confusing and often contradicts itself.  There are far  better books / writers on strategy - try the writers Lynch and Grant for a  more informative view on strategy 
 THE MOUSE THAT ROARED was a disappointment to me in many ways--the tortuous academic prose style, the ever-present word "pedagogy" in all of its various forms, the rather sinister view of the Disney Company's motivations in their influence on education and popular culture.  I was especially disappointed in Giroux's treatmemt of Walt Disney, who he refers to occasionally as "Old Walt Disney" (Old?) In his discussion, he presents as facts some myths about Walt Disney that have been refuted by a host of scholars and historians.  I feel that this is a disservice to the memory of Walt Disney, and further, it makes me question the entire content of the book 
 I bought this cushion because I had to move from California to New York and expected the drive to be torture on my back. I researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units, and because I had recently bought a Mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it--this cushion has "Sqush," which has a similar feel.The cushion has a middle portion of Sqush which is concentrated into 3 "lumps"--at your shoulders, lower back, and under the front part of your thighs, near your knees. The lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material. The rest of the cushion feels like fleece.When I first plugged it in, I was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors. Even at the highest intensity (I never even bother with the lower two), it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration--definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back. The pre-set programs are fine but I rarely use them. It comes with straps but I had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non-existent and it wasn't intuitive at all. I ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair, which worked well.I can't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable. The lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt. The thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat (my car doesn't have fancy seat controls) and I had to wedge myself into the seat. The massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going, but it simply wasn't powerful enough to be really effective. The worse thing is that the thigh motor DIED only a few hours into my trip!! It has a 2 year warranty, but you have to pay a $5 "handling" fee! I'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if I hadn't, I'd return it to Amazon and wash my hands of it.Overall, this cushion is underpowered, unreliable, and not as orthopedically correct as it should be. It is definitely not worth the outrageous price. I regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead. I wish I had saved my money for Homedic's highly rated Shiatsu seat cushion instead, although I'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now 
 I believe this book  makes a valid point for the pularity of companies today.  There are just enough tidbits to make the read worthwhile.  However,  I found the book frustrating.  The author suffers from disclipine.  He makes poor use of analogies and the book, while chock full of examples, could many times be examples of the contra opionion: diversification.  The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims.  Without it he comes off as someone who makes up his mind what position he wants and then grasps anything possible to support his ideal. For those interested in the subject I relay the maxim, "Concentrate when in control otherwise diversify.&quot 
 I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too

 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 I've read many, many books in my life. Good and bad. This leans towards the bad. I gave it two stars simply for the love of the game. That is the only reason I made it through this horrid attempt at literary adaptation. I read fall of reach and found it to be a fairly decent novel. I noticed they switched writers when they published this one. This was a huge mistake. Dietz is possibly the blandest writers I have ever forced myself to read. There is absolutely no feeling to what he is writing. He even makes grievous grammar errors throughout the entire book. I found myself reading sentences time and time again in order to mine the meaning from them. Simply put, this is a bad. Real bad. I don't even think the back story is worth it. I noticed they switched back to the previous writer for the next book so someone must have noticed. If you really feel the need to read a book you've probably already played, then go for it. If you want to skip the shudders and shakes that Dietz's writing style will induce, don't feel guilty; you're not missing much. 
 I'm evaluating the DVI version.  The cables are sold seperately, so what's the point to buy a KVM without cables?!?  Lastly, hearing the problems doesn't surprise me, as working with the two port version, I had some problems where computers becames unresponsive 
 I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.  Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake.  I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly 
 I ordered this title with the information posted on your site that "Summer Of 59" was on it making it a 4 track CDS! I get a three track single. adleast your sending a replacement but it BETTER be the 4 track version you discribed the first time!. Now I see you corrected the error & put up "3" tracks! You guys at Amazon better pay more attention & the single was fine except Amazons Blantant false advertising! Our mini site at: Judemac Forever 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 This book is well-written and contains fascinating information, especially in the early sections dealing with Berlin's pre-Germanic, Slavic history. Later on, the bloody  Soviet assault on the city in 1945 against ferocious resistance is depicted magnificiently, while Richie's account of atrocities committed by Soviet troops is truly horrifying.       Where Faust's Metropolis runs into trouble is in the author's tendency to slip into factual errors and in her more  pronounced tendency to present her reactionary political  interpretations as indisputable depictions of reality.                                                              Some of the factual errors are relatively minor; an example would be her assertion that during World War I the expensive German battleships were never used. Actually, they were used - against the British at Jutland, one of the most spectacular naval battles ever fought. In addition, she actually believes, or claims to believe, that Britain entered World War I to protect the neutrality rights of Belgium. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the War knows that the British themselves initially planned to invade neutral Holland in order to strike at Germany; the plan was abandoned out of military considerations, not legal or ethical ones.                                                                 More serious are the errors brought on by the author's hatred of Marxism. One need not be an admirer of Stalin in order to realize that her claim that he spurned Britain and France in order to sign a pact with Hitler is pure nonsense. Stalin signed the pact only after the Western allies refused to sign an alliance with him, hoping that the Germans would attack the U.S.S.R. rather than Poland and France. Another area in which she substitutes fantasy for history is in her treatment of Generals Montgomery and Patton and their conflicts with Eisenhower. Both are presented as heroic in their eagerness to provoke a confrontation with the Soviets; Patton, she tells us, was fired "because the Americans would not allow anyone to sour relations with Stalin." Actually, Eisenhower removed Patton from his command after he disobeyed direct orders to stop associating with Nazis and openly planning for World War III. Montgomery, another head case, is lauded for his plan to dash accross Germany and seize Berlin just as it was in the grasp of the Soviets. Somehow he emerges as the hero of the Battle of the Bulge; Richie contends that Eisenhower "hid in his headquarters" during the battle because he feared that the Germans would try to assassinate him.                                                                   Richie's treatment of the G.D.R. after the War reads like one of those pamphlets I was given to read in grade school - the ones written by J.Edgar Hoover or Cardinal Spellman. She finds nothing good about East Germany, not even free, guaranteed medical care or daycare for children, which are described as "rigid social benefits." What are non-rigid social benefits? The kind you get in the form of a trust account or monthly checks from an affluent mommy and daddy? Sometimes her denunciations take on a hysterical tone, as when she declares that the Evangelical Church of the G.D.R. (which made a point of attacking racism and human inequality) was "was very much the successor of Hitler's 'National Church.'" Ravings like this pass beyond the borders of muddled thinking and sloppy scholarlship and enter that of ideological fanaticism.                                                            Richie sides with every cold war hardliner she comes accross, from Richard Pipes to James Baker. Detente was a big mistake, we are assured, because it gave the Soviets military superiority in Europe; why they didn't use it to evict the West is not explained. Willy Brandt's opening to the East was also a no-no; he should have followed the Christian Democrats in blindly following the U.S. Ronald Reagan is a big hero; his absurd Star Wars plan, Richie thinks, is what led to the fall of the Soviet Union and the G.D.R. One has to wonder about the judgement of an author who believes that Reagan, whose government financed the Guatemalan and Salvadoran death squads, stood for international freedom and justice.                                                              In a lengthy and sanctimonious afterward the author's right-wing agenda becomes even more explicit.  she lectures West Berliners that "the road away from the United  States is the road to disaster" and insults Willy Brandt's widow as "pathetic" for begging to differ. She also lumps the Greens ("dreamy environmentalists") and Berlin's new leftists in with vicious neo-Nazis as opponents of U.S. leadership.                                                           At some points in this book Richie seems to reject the concept of collective guilt for the Holocaust, at other points she wants the Communists, who themselves were murdered, jailed or forced into exile by the Nazis, to assume responsibility for it. In the afterward  she encourages "all Berliners ... to try to be worthy of forgiveness." This will probably happen around the same time that British Tories accept responsibility for Britain's leading role in the slave trade and for the genocical witholding of food during the Irish Potato Famine.                                                               One last point. For someone who throws around so many phrases about freedom and democracy, Richie seems to have a rather odd idea of how this works out in practice. As a sign of "hope and optimism" she notes that "hard-line East German teachers were barred from schools" after reunification. In other words, Marxist teachers were fired, as they were in the U.S. in the McCarthy Era. The old Tory interpretation of individual rights - Of course you have freedom of speech. All we ask is that you don't try to exercise it 
 The movie is cool because it offers different surfing than normally seen in surf movies, but I buy surf films to watch over and over. Which I would not do with this movie. Just not enough action. 
 I just finished reading this book and was tremendously disappointed.  I kept with it, thinking it would get better, and now wish I had put it down like previous reviewers had.   I cannot recommend this book.  Don't waste your time. 
 White Teeth was a tolerable read however I tried to read this on and off over a period of 2 years until I was determined not to let my money go to complete waste. Result was I skim read it all just to get it over and done with. I found the phrases repetitive with a lot of useless details. I think the characters were written with the aim to have enough flaws as to appear realistic but I found them all rather flat and I held no particular regard for any of them. In the end I couldn't care less about what happened, I just wanted to get to the last page 
 I enjoyed this book but the new edition does not contain the color plates from the first edition. Why? The illustrations are wonderful and add so much to the text. Without them the book's value to a reader is seriously diminished 
 I read this book partially because I had to for a class, partially a suggestion from my dad because he'd read Gleick's other books.  I read about halfway through it and, I must say, for a book about how the world is getting too fast, this book jumped around pretty quickly.  It'd be talking about watches for about 6 pages (which was the longest chapter I got to), then the next chapter would come, it'd be less than half that length and about TV and newscasters.  Seriously, it seemed like it had ADD!  I grew up in this faster-paced world and I know that it's faster than what used to be.  I hear stories, I know that television didn't exist a hundred years ago, and I certainly don't need 281 telling me that my generation has it bad because everything's sped up, especially when the chapters could most definately be cut in half because all you need to read is about the first half of any chapter to get what you'd like out of it.  Not to keep rambling, but we all know the world's faster, so why don't we just slow down what we can and don't waste our time reading this book?  
 Hi, I bought this DVD, hoping that there would be some practical explanation of buddhist principles given by the Dalai Lama. However, it is a documentary (and it is a good documentary) about buddhism in general. The point that annoys me about this product is that "Dalai Lama" is written all over it, yet he only makes a short appearance in the 300 minutes of film 
 I am a software engineer and I like to read about other sciences, but this book has disappointed me to have ideas about neuroscience. In my reading experience I found it as the most confusing book, the author talks about his life more than the science indicated in the title of the book. 
 I am not complaining about the quality of this product, as it seems to be made well. However, it is not universal as the company states. I thought I would save some money buying this, but it is nowhere NEAR big enough for my 42" TV. The part that mounts to the wall is literally 8" too short. If you have anything over 20 inches, don't make my mistake. Check your manual for the best mount first...I wish I had 
 The book starts out reasonably well enough, with Davidson drawing you into the overview of the life of Carl Sagan's parents.  But as the book progresses, you begin to see another side to the story of Sagan's life that you weren't expecting.  Davidson doesn't hesitate to make broad generalizations and interpretations of his interviews with people in Sagan's life, even making borderline psychoanalytical conclusions to explain his behavior when Davidson is clearly not qualified in this area.  There were several points where I read a line and found myself just staring at the book with a gaping jaw and a sense of incredulility, wondering how he could make such a strange conclusion.  For example, when he discussed Sagan's novel Contact, it quickly became apparant that Davidson hadn't even read the book or he wouldn't be making such strange interpretations of the book's plot.  Additionally, Davidson's writing is incredibly simplistic; although it may appear vivid and engaging on the surface, it is full of groan-inducing cliches and overdramatized descriptions of events.  This, in combination with his purely speculative conclusions on Sagan's personality, made me want to vomit.  Overall, although I was able to glimpse a small part of what made Carl Sagan so special and see a somewhat decent overview of the events in his life, I feel I was getting a blurry and distorted picture of who the man really was 
 I bought "Mexico City: An Ancient Mystery of Passion", another travel guide DVD by Acacian Tales.  If you want to watch a slideshow of fuzzy pictures with crummy music playing (nothing is ever said), this is your DVD.  If you don't want to be ripped off, stay away 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.  What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves 
 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the  main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale 
 I suppose it is theoretically possibly that a viewer could be "shocked" or "enthralled" by this movie if they had never seen anything outside the Hollywood movie and certainly no previous Catherine Breillat movies. But even then, I am skeptical.  This movie is boring, and it has a "been there, done that" feel from Breillat. This movie's problems are indicative of what I feel is the larger problem plaguing "art house" cinema the last couple of years. They have become as formulaic and thoughtlessly perfunctory as your most paint-by-numbers Hollywood romantic comedy. Too many movies that are supposed to be providing intelligent and thought-provoking alternatives to what elitists call "The Hollywood swill" are not doing that. Instead, the art house formula has grown distressingly predictable lately. Build a movie around graphic sex and/or violence and let the controversy fly, if anyone actually cares. Maybe some people will jump to your defense and declare your film a masterpiece.   Even more distressing though, is the even more prevalent art-house formula of atrributing a bizarre (often sexual or neurotic) character trait and then spending a dreary movie length watching the character fuss and moan and generally be an introverted, narcissistic, navel-gazer over said trait.   Example. In Breillat's superior film "Romance" a woman feels cut off and empty and sexually and emotionally unsatisfied, so she has degrading sex. Fine. But wait a minute. Didn't we see this in "Intimacy" and "The Piano Teacher" (the latter being the best of all these films)?  And therein lies the problem. It's a formula, just like "Legally Blonde" or "30 Going On 30." It becomes even more readily apparent when you watch these films, and other films by Breillat as consecutively as you can. If we are taking some of these French films at face value (which I would not advise) we could come to the conclusion, that in France, it is the worst thing on earth to be sexually unsatisfied or repressed. Because, like Breillat, these characters (with the exception of The Piano Teacher) seem to monomaniacal, uninteresting sex zombies. The viewer is treated to "I'm sexually unsatisfied/repressed. Let us wring our hands over this tragedy and fling melodrama around like nobody's business." You know the like. People end up mutilating their genitals, or waxing pseudo-philosophical on the ugliness of the female vessel, or having rough, degrading sex, etc.  You reach a point where you simply don't care any more. Go ahead, watch a lot of Breillat films as close together as you dare. At the end of them, you simply will not give a damn about these overwrought characters and their sexual neuroses. Honestly. You will begin to wonder: don't these characters have better things to worry about? Or better yet: why should I care or even watch such vapid, one-dimensional characters?  The answer to that question is: I don't know. But I do know art house cinema has to do better than give us characters with bizarre character traits and then muddle over them endlessly with precious little else to work with.   As for Breillat, "Anatomy Of Hell" shows that, short of American director-voyeur of "kids being bad and having sex, ready, set, be shocked, middle America who's been living under a rock" Larry Clark (a man content to make the same movie over and over and over again) she may be the most one-track, one-trick, monomaniacal director in the world. She is easily the equal of Woody Allen when it comes to working out your personal neuroses on the screen and calling it art. But at least Allen could take the audience to a larger variety of places. With Breillat, it's just sex, sex, and sex, and "Anatomy of Hell" is no different.  With regards back to my condemnation of art house cinema as too formulaic in some regards now, it is quite laughable that a mainstream Hollywood film like "Closer" (you don't get more mainstream than Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman at the writing of this), has better dialogue, is more incisiveness and vastly more intelligent, interesting, and ultimately, shocking (shocking us with intellectually brutal truths, not cheap physical acts) than "Anatomy of Hell." I find it laughably because the movies on the fringe, the art house cinema, is supposed to be more intelligent and tell us more than the bloated Hollywood mainstream, or so film elitists would have us think.  Well, "Anatomy Of Hell" soundly proves them wrong. The characters are preposterous and boring. From its ridiculously formulaic and a postmodern style that was dated a decade ago, the main characters of course have no names. Yes, yes, it doesn't take a Michael Bay fan to read into this. The man is a misogynistic straw man to be easily knocked over by women. His character is tantamount to lampooning Archie Bunker and saying "Take THAT Republicans!" He finds the female genitals disgusting and likens them to a bird squashed in the film (and that is just delightful, isn't it?).   The movie is absurdly heavy-handed, bowed by the force of its own artificial weightiness. If you want inane discussion of the war of the sexes that is almost laughably overwrought, made all the more unbelievable by its own strident seriousness, sounding like something written by a deadly earnest, deadly pretentious 1970s college student, you've come to the right place.   I also find the editorial review laughable. It says something to the effect of this movie "pushing the boundaries of film" or some such thing. How ludicrous. Director Breillat actually pushed the envelope on shocking sexual imagery back in 1976 with "Une Vraie Jeune Fille," or "A Real Young Girl," a far more shocking and graphic (and better, with more substance and better supported messages) movie than this one. 30 years later, and Breillat hasn't moved one bit - she's jogging in place. What was shocking, interesting, bold, and innovative in 1976 is now dated. It shows how little her filmmaking has grown (and in the ways it has regressed) that in terms of "pushing the envelope" on sexual politics and identity she's been upstaged by herself nearly 30 years earlier.  Furthermore, some of the best ground in "Anatomy Of Hell" was covered in superior fashion in Breillat's "Romance" and "Sex Is Comedy." Now, neither of those movies are great, but "Romance" is a solid 3 star movie. Even the ground it just touches upon does better work with the material than a half hour devoted to the same subject in "Anatomy of Hell." After watching the movie, you basically haven't made a journey since the beginning. Like the characters, you're left with an empty experience that has shown or accomplished nothing.  So, in conclusion, this movie fails as art, fails in all of its objectives except perhaps repugnance, and it certainly fails as entertainment. I do not recommend it 
 At the time when I looked over the reviews for the book and this VHS tape reviewers were raving and I thought "What the heck? Let's give it a try." Well, I did and I regret it. While the book was at least funny in parts the video was boring and I didn't learn anything new or different that the book hadn't addressed. I think watching my mother have sex would be more instructive and exciting than this video. Hell even watching my mother-in-law would be better 
 When I started reading this book, I was excited.  After all his first book was a laugh-a-minute.  The reviews of this book were upbeat and funny, however, I didn't think it was at all.  The plot jumped around a bit, and the whole animal rights point of view was pushed a little to far.  I don't disagree with the notion, but I fell it killed the story.  And the ending wasn't that great either.  It felt like at about 80% through the book, the ending happened, and then the last 20% was either to bring the word count up, or just to give a 'readers digest' version of the rest of the main characters lives 
 I bought this book expecting Chuck D to have some major insights into race relations, not just black and white, with advice to the world on how to make them better.  His advice is to only separate blacks further from the rest of the american community, in my opinion, bringing out the segregation blacks so fervently fought against in the early 1900's.  Out of nowhere, he'll make a point which makes you admire him for standing out of the normal rap crowd.  But he'll say it in one sentence, and go on to something else, making you wonder where his insight went.  If the roles were reversed, and this were a white author, this book would have been considered racist propaganda.  There are a hundred double standards in this book.  Would have expected a more cohesive book.  An example, he quotes a lyric from one of his songs as Elvis being a racist, and in the next paragraph backtracking saying the what Elvis stood for is what he's against, not the person.  If this were a high school paper, I can't imagine it would get any better grade than a C.  I left this book feeling very confused on where Chuck D stands.  He makes many statements and his evidence to support it makes you thinking the opposite of his view.  I expected much more out of this well respected icon 
 Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I suspect the people who gave this book 5 stars are either friends of the author or work for Princeton Press.  The back cover promises a book that "brings the same keen eye and clear explanations to bear on the most prevalent, and maybe the most subtle and least understood, system of visual organization". Well, maybe if you have Kimberly Elam by your side in a classroom walking you through each of the examples in the book, but certainly not if you're trying to make sense of the book on your own.  In fact, there are practically no "clear explanations" in the book. The author mentions a few basic concepts in passing but that's not enough to teach you anything. And a bunch of examples thrown at you without any sort of pedagogic scaffolding does little more than frustrate you 
 I cannot comment since I have not receive my shipment since I purchased it on Oct 31, 2006.  Still trying to find out where it went to 
 For a movie that was intended to commemorate one of the darkest days in American history, I was really disappointed in the film Pearl Harbor.  As others have mentioned, the love story took up far to much of the films overly long three hour running time.  Even portions of this part of the film failed to be historically accurate.  For example, the scene with Affleck, and Beckinsale, seen standing on the painting scaffold that dangled over the side of the liner Queen Mary, as it sat, supposedly in Hawaii, late in 1941.  The Queen Mary was a British passenger liner; were on earth do the writers think this ship was in late 1941?  It sure wasn't painted in its bright peacetime colors making pleasure cruises to Hawaii.  The British by this time had been at war for two years.  The Queen Mary was, in fact, painted drab gray and carring British troops throughout the Southern Hemisphere, mainly from Austrailia to Eygpt for the battle of North Africa.  You would think the films makers would have at least tried to hide the name of the ship painted on its bow.  This is just one example on many historical goofs that occur throughout the entire film.  Do the writers and director think that everyone seeing this film is ignorant about history?  Most producers, and directors tell viewers in interviews on DVD special features that they want to get it right historically as a tribute to the heroic efforts of those who actually took part in the events being portrayed.  The producers, and Director of Titanic went the extra mile to get it as accurate as possible.  To bad the makers of this film didn't do their homework before beginning production. It's a shame, considering the money that was spent. It's said that actions speak louder than words, well, for the writers, producers, and director of this film it should be noted that the results of their actions speak louder than their intentions too.  The WW 2 veterans who saw this must have been sadly disappointed 
 I hated this movie, it was so boring, I hated his love interest she was too "quirky", this is a poorly written mass of bad jokes, idiotic parents and it was supposed to be in the 70's? I couldnt tell. Dustin Hoffman hasnt been in a good film since the 80's, and he is starting to look like a woman. Susan Sarandon, she is just worn out and obviously cant get any big named roles either. 
 I found this book to be informative, however, after reviewing the book and trying to work through the examples I found a tremendous amount of errors, mis-prints and, lack of continuity.   I would not recommend this book for the beginner, but for the experienced tech it does offer some unique thoughts.  
 I bought this book based on the review of others.  If this is really the best out there, somebody new needs to get started writing Excel books.  IF you already know some programming concepts and IF you are willing to spend alot of time combing through the book, you might find what you are looking for.  I found just enough to put my old programming experience together with Excel's built-ins and alot of trial and error to get what I needed.  The index is pathetic, clearly put together by a computer rather than a knowledgeable human being.  The examples are all focused on the formatting of cells or cutesy message boxes.  Message boxes can be useful, but if I only needed Excel to format data, I wouldn't need to write code 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 Much of what Col Hunt has to say is quite interesting and I agree with his views and arguments, however, the book is more like a +200 page rant and rave than a well written book.  I felt like he was just complaining most of the time about what's wrong with politicians and he offers "simple" solutions to all of our problems which are entirely unrealistic.  It's a good example of why are our government is not run by the military and why we need civilians ultimately in control.  A great man, who has served his country with great honor, but in my view is not a very good author.  Ultimately, I did not enjoy this book, and struggled to force myself to finish it 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 This book glorifies a toddler who squishes strawberries in the supermarket, throws groceries out which causes patrons to slip, opens boxes of cereal and dumps them on the floor..... Not a wise choice 
 After reading the Hiram Key, I was all to excited to run on down to a local store and buy this book.  It is informative to a point, but the author has gone so deep into his own exhaustive personal experience that I found it almost unreadable.  Great author but this book is one to skip unless you prefer absolute tedium. 
 I bought this hoping to get either structural or design ideas.  It contains almost no structural or layout suggestions.  It really should have been named "Decorating Ideas for Basements". 90% of the basements shown are hideous.  Some look like someone with $$$ to burn decorated a dorm room while drunk.  Others look like a caricature of "wealthy", and simply look expensive and tacky at the same time. Most of the rooms don't meet construction code, either.  I suspect a lot of the rooms shown aren't actually IN a basement in real life. Great designs for your basement if it will never contain kids, pets, neighbors, family, or the sighted. 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
 Sorry, but this is both an unimportant work, and pornographic (when every chapter revolves around one sex scene, I think it is safe to accuse a book of being pornographic).  Understandably, it has been written that this book was intended to be exploitative, and di Prima wrote it because she needed money.  Great.  I hold nothing against writers doing what they need to do to make a living.  If I recall correctly, Stephen King got his start writing articles for Playboy.  With all that said, however, I think it is also important not to hold a book to unrealistic expectations, simply because of the author.  Porn, porn, porn.  Let's see: chapter 1, sex with Ivan.  Chapter 2, recollection of the first time she had sex with Ivan.  Chapter 3, sex with Robin (a man in love with Ivan).  Chapter 4, Sex with Tomi (a female friend).  Chapter 5, Tomi has sex with Tomi's brother.  Chapter 6, Sex with 4 other women.  Chapter 7, sex with Tomi's father Serge.  Chapter 8, sex with young Jack and some guy with big ears while runaway girl watches.  And so it goes, through all the chapters.  So, if you're looking for a "spank" book, then check it out.  If you're looking for a book about the beats from a woman's perspective (as it is boldly proclaimed on the front cover), look somewhere else. 
 It's a classic I know, but I just couldn't follow the country dialouge. Seeing the movie, the story itself is good. But in the book it is soo hard to understand and doesn't.....flow. Maybe it is just me? It's a classic, but I didn't like it. I recomend the book 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews.  Perhaps I was spoiled by "Memoirs of a Geisha" and "The Good Earth", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring.  Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice!  Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it 
 You might not like  this book.The best part of this story is when he finds a cat in the trashcan.And he all ways wanted a dog.And I did not like the book becuse it got boring when you just read it all the time.But you might like it.But it was kind of good 
 I did not buy this from Amazon but sought it out here so I could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning, that it outrages me).  This is two packets of colored dust, approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster.  Empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere, mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart.  My wife and I repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not.  The claim on the package is that it "Molds like Dough," obviously intended to remind us of Play-doh, but Play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can, in fact, be molded.  This material -- again attempting to compare itself to Play-doh -- states that it won't dry out.  Of course not!  It's dust!  It can't dry out, there's nothing drier than dust.  In case you're wondering I have no connection to Play-doh or its makers (I don't even know who does make it), I'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses Play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime.  Wrong 
 Sorry, but I really hated this pretentious, boring, and useless exercise in academic masturbation. It's all just an excuse for the writer to drone on and on about her favorite books. A lackluster lesson in literary snobbery, this lifeless thesis paper includes iffy interpretations of dry excerpts, unhelpful writing hints, and zero sense of humor or drama. If you don't love the same books, stories, and writers that Francine Prose loves, you're pretty much screwed. As a published writer myself, I often check out writing books for inspiration. This is one of the worst. I prefer something lighter, more engaging and motivational to light a fire under me. I like Ray Bradbury's book, with its infectious boyish enthusiasm, and the terrific book about publishing, "The Forrest for the Trees" (the first half is inspiring, but the second half a little depressing.) Either way, skip this yawn-fest 
 Overall I am disappointed in this volume, Hush Returns.  I collect all Batman Graphic Novels, and this is distinctly the least successful of any I have read in the last year or more.  It does not compare to Loeb's original "Hush" collection, or continue on from the conclusion reached in that collection. Do not buy it expecting a third part to the Hush story.   Most graphic novels tell a tale (albeit sometimes with an open ending or as part of a series) that follows a story arc.  You have your traditional introduction, the bulk of your story, and then your conclusion. "Hush Returns" has no conclusion, the ending is far from satisfactory.  It's not all bad - the art is good, and some of the characterisation is quite enjoyable.  The timeline is interrupted by the happenings in "Under the Hood", which doesn't make it easy for the author.  I was shocked to see the Joker's backstory introduced, and didn't at all like the humanisation of Joker - which is very much at odds with his portrayal elsewhere in the DC Universe (ie as an inhuman maniac).  Having said all that - it's a Batman Graphic Novel, so if you're a Bat-fan, you'll probably buy it anyway.  Just don't expect brillance, and you won't be disappointed. 
 From the openning cut by Fergie (which drones so bad) to the final notes of the CD, i felt that sinking feeling...and there's got to be "a morning after".  Many have panned the film and I agree with them. However the score does not help with many assessment of the film.   The 40 minutes score presented on this cd are so  water-logged I am still trying to get the water outta of ears. Klaus Badelt tried too hard to make a Titanic outta this sinking ship.  The horns seems no muted like they are underwater..too much tuba involvement this combined with Bass oboes i think it dont work here, you need more music for action and not the sea. The strings section try to give a Staccato feeling for the action and it misses. For a good example of this action feeling, you need to get the Firm soundtrack to see it.   The best cut on the whole sounding is "drowning" (YES, I am serious of the name of the cut!). Which is also what I suggest you should do with this CD if you buy it  Bennet Pomerantz, Audioworld   
 Ohhgawd avoid this crapola like poison.  This is neither a scholastically researched, nor an academically-sound nor a first-person-adventure account of this important topic.  This is a VERY serious topic deserving of far better treatment than this book has given it.  OK, its better than the other book on this topic ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' (Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke) but not much.  Save yourself the dough.  The fact that there is a dearth of good books on this topic does not mean you should squander your hard-earned money this way.  This is on the same level as most other books on Nazi Flying Saucers.  Strictly supermarket check-out counter level gutter hacko-journo-workmanship.  The publication equivalent of plumbing works. 
 This was the first and last Iris Johansen book I will read. I thought oh I need something to do at work since its going to be slow today (I work in a library). So I broght it with me and it was so boring I actually fell asleep! I will not be finishing this book. It has no substance. I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of time and money. Although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it 
 This is the book we used in my first undergraduate course in topology. I remember it as being one of the worst textbooks I ever came across in my undergraduate math studies. The explanations were too short and many definitions were buried into the text. I remember constantly having to flip through the pages of this book to find something I was looking for. Stay away from this book 
 "The gnomic interiority of its lyrics invites the type of deep exegesis usually reserved for..." is not a really atypical sentence opening in Hultkrans' book. If you like "Love" and this sort of writing, you will really like this book. Otherwise, you may be better off reading the book on the group by Love's 3rd drummer, Michael Stuart-Ware 
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
 Mr. Blum has arguably written the worst account of a war in history.  Amazingly, he chooses to focus on the young Israeli couple torn apart by the war (of course, the whole nation's citizenery were torn apart as well), while completely ignoring the major players in the world (US, Soviets, etc.)  It is as if he was just trying to fill up the pages of the book while doing no research at the expense of the reader.  The great Six Day War by Michael Orin also delves into the incredibly important diplomatic efforts surrounding that war.  No war book can overlook the importance of "world opinion" at the time, but this one does. Admittedly, the Israeli couple had a very interesting story to tell, but it adds nothing to the history of the conflict and the story finishes with a very incomplete conclusion on the two characters.  In contrast, many other great tomes (my favorite thus far is The Two O'Clock War by Walter Boyne) highlight the dire situation that Israel faced, and the necessary US airlift that arguably saved the country.  Also, Mr. Boyne discusses the many lessons learned by the Arab nations (mostly Egypt) and its effect on the Yom Kippur War.   Mr. Blum seems to have an axe to grind on the very controversial general and now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  It is well known that he was a "rebel" in both the best and worst meaning of the word, but Blum seems to obsess over the negative aspects and the government's repeated attempts to relieve him of his command.  Again, Mr. Boyne addresses this topic more fairly, pointing out that Sharon's soldiers loved, admired, and trusted him, and that his daring was often beneficial militarily.  Truly, a double edged sword. Blum makes no mention of Hosni Mubarak's importance in the conflict.  Of course, the US "ally" (and recipient of billions in aid while his state controlled media incites hatred of Jews/Christians/etc.) and strongman, has ruled Egypt under "emergency" rule for over 20 years (since open to democracy by Condi & George...don't deny leftists!).  His later importance to Egypt is formed partially during the conflict. I could go on, but suffice it to say that any other book you read on this amazing moment in world history would be better written and more informative than the Eve of Destruction. 
 One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of mone 
 This book is possibly the stupidest book I have ever read. The stories are boring with no plot or character development. Do not read this book 
 I found "The Forever War" a forever let-down. Considering all the hype and the Hugo and Nebula awards, I would have expected much better.  The main complaint is the irrelevant ending.  We get to know and care about characters, and follow their thorny path along the plot, wonder where they go, and who they will become at the end of the story, and then !BLAM-O!  We get an ending--a sappy, car crash, too pat ending--that had nothing to do with the previous 34 chapters. In business, we would call this fraud; in law, breach of contract.  This slipshod ending is either do to Haldeman's artistic ability, or it is a reflection of his worldview.  It cannot be the first--Haldeman has that rare flair to mix science with narrative, which makes for top notch sci-fi.  (His use of time dilation is a masterstroke) Therefore I think it comes from his worldview, which, like most people of his generation, was hastily generalized by the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's.   To paraphrase Jack London, I got the feeling that his generalizations (like many of his generation) were made between the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon, and he had failed to revise them since then.  So is this a critique of Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers" or a critique of Nam?  I go back and forth with this novel.  It does serve to temper Heinlein's idealism--the "if men were angels" problem--but it also serves to normalize (or at least desensitize) madcap behavior.  In this way, the book is a less funny "Catch-22" or a cosmic "Caine Mutiny."  Of course Heinlein, as a non-combat servicemen, knew how sailors talked and drank and did AHEM, but his book is clearly didactic, while Haldeman's is merely descriptive.  Even so, I felt manipulated.  All the career servicemen were jingoistic warmongers; all the conscripted NCOs were morally pure victims.  And calling some of the aliens "teddy bears" was cheap saccharine.  Additionally, there is the prepubescent glee in transforming Heinlein's juvie into an adult novel--complete with adult situations, adult language, and rampant adultery.  The chapters (especially the earlier ones) were formulaic:  1.	They are given new orders that do not make any sense. 2.	Something goes wrong with the irrational orders. 3.	S.N.A.F.U. 4.	Mandella and a female NCO have AHEM.  The characters had no motivation, just passive shoulder shrugging. In this sense they are not protagonists, just placeholders who use sex as escape.  In turn, the genetically altered post-humans become homosexual, so even that one release is removed.  Unlike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or Galahad, once Mandella becomes chaste, he never became interesting.  "My strength is as the strength of ten/Because my heart is pure."  Even so, Haldeman doe illustrate some important flaws with conscription, casual drug use, casual sex, government solipotence, government deception.  (Keeping in mind that all of these go hand-in-hand). Furthermore, the book may have been helpful in the post-Vietnam era, as a release and a reaffirmation of what just happened.  If it is, then the book looses it's relevancy in the current conflagration. There is no miscommunication and no misunderstanding the terrorists. 
 After reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Very close minded and not open to any changes. At the end you will be like whatever 
 I have two words of horror for you, Electronics Expo.  I purchased this set through Amazon, who then relied on Electronics Expo to send the TV.  First off, they sent it via UPS rather than a qualified TV delivery service like Amazon uses.  When I hooked up the TV, the picture worked for 30 seconds then went to a green screen and blinked once in a while.  I called Samsung and they said that they would send someone out in about a week, but if the problem occurred during shipping, the waranty wouldn't cover the repair.  I decided to email Electronics Expo to request a new set and ask for a shipping label.  They emailed me and told me that they wouldn't accept a return of a TV over 20 inches!  I read the return policy and noticed that it only applied to returned items for unwanted items, not defective items.  Electronics Expo then ceased to return my emails.  I called and spoke to a manager who tried telling me that if the item was damaged while shipping, I would have to wait for them to be reimbursed by UPS before my new TV was shipped!  The TV looked great for the 30 seconds that I actually saw a signal, but if this is being shipped by Electronics Expo, play it safe and spend the extra money to buy it elsewhere 
 	The Burden of Bad Ideas is an exploration of the shortcomings of urban public policy, examining issues such as welfare, teachers' education, foster care, homelessness, and multicultural curriculum in our nation's school system. The author investigates the ideology of the "nation's elite orthodoxy" and its impact on modern American society.   	Heather Mac Donald holds a John M. Olin fellowship at the Manhattan Institute. She works as a contributing editor for the City Journal, covering issues such as education, homelessness, racial profiling, and the New York court system. Mac Donald earned a J.D. from Stanford University Law School and is a non-practicing lawyer.  	The author's methodology stems largely from her personal experiences in the field of journalism. Mac Donald visited teachers' education classes, homeless shelters, and sat in on public hearings. The author conducted extensive interviewing with people on both the policy-maker side and the recipient side of issues, claiming, "If you want to know how well social policies are working, I learned, ask the poor - when their advocates aren't around."  While the interviewing certainly creates an entertaining read, a lack of concrete sources or citations to support her "facts" has a negative impact upon the integrity of the author's work.   	Mac Donald's book is arranged into twelve chapters. Each chapter covers a different political issue. In "An F for Hip-Hop 101," she examines a course offered at a Brooklyn public high school, studying what she terms "ghetto culture," including graffiti, deejaying, emceeing, and breakdancing. "Why Johnny's Teacher Can't Teach" is a scathing criticism of education courses on the college level, lambasting the teachers' education system as supporting "Anything But Knowledge."  In her chapter entitled "Law School Humbug," the author discusses how the presence of racial and feminist theory harms serious scholarship in the college classroom. The book develops into a fairly predictable pattern, with Mac Donald's vitriol against the "elites" and liberals ever-present, the chapters merely providing different flavors of her disgust and frustration.  	The author, in her introduction, begins with admirable questions: Why aren't our children learning basic skills in public schools? Why aren't programs designed to help the poor really helping them? What will happen to our society if we continue to reject the notion of personal responsibility? Why is our media untruthful and how does this shape public opinion? The answer to all of these questions is more or less a blanket response: Liberal, elitist ideology has caused the United States moral and intellectual bankruptcy. Mac Donald calls for a return to the traditional Western models of thought and education that she feels laid the foundation for the greatness of the United States.  	The problem inherent to this book is a touchy one. Mac Donald approaches many of the issues as an outsider, and it shows. In "Law School Humbug," she criticizes women of color for writing about the politicization of their hair. She claims this is part of a "new genre of legal scholarship - first-person narrative." While the author's point that this sort of narrative deviates from the traditional conventions may hold merit, she obfuscates her own point with a dismissive comment, "Not since the Age of Aquarius has hair possessed such political significance." Mac Donald's flippancy only reinforces the impetus for these sorts of narrative, that those belonging to the majority have discounted, devalued, and ignored the minority experience.   	The Burden of Bad Ideas without a doubt exposes many of the flaws in the upper-class liberal ideology. Mac Donald captures the patronization of the liberals to the have-nots, and notes the many occasions where liberal guilt creates ridiculous loopholes in the public assistance system that may be exploited. She paints a vivid picture of the tendency within liberal academia to exoticize other cultures, placing them upon pedestals so narrow they hold no room for honest critique. In the end, the author's efforts fall short. Mac Donald's writing becomes merely one side in a shouting match that takes place between two sides of people who have very little in common with the folk whose fates they argue, with one side wanting to indulgently pat the heads of the underprivileged and coo over their artistic and cultural achievements, while the other side sneers at the relevance.   	Mac Donald's book provides raises many interesting questions and can be used to provoke thoughtful discussion in a classroom setting, or as a springboard for more in-depth research.  Unfortunately, the author's resort to name-calling and the lack of support and citation for her research undermines her credibility. The Burden of Bad Ideas ultimately succeeds in startling its audience, rather than accomplishing any serious enlightenment 
 Walpola Rahula's book is simply put, Theravada dogma which pushes the belief that the Buddha taught natthatta, namely, there is no self.  Rahula makes a number of claims about what the Buddha taught which have no basis in original Buddhism.  For example, Rahula gives a confusing account of the Five Aggregates (Pali, khandhas).  He omits any serious discussion of why the Buddha does not identify his own self with the Five Aggregates or why the Buddha always deprecates the Five Aggregates declaring them, for example, to be the Buddhist devil, Mara the Evil One.  It never seems to dawn on Rahula that the Buddha, in his many discourses, is deploying the via negativa (Grk. apophasis) with regard to the Five Aggregates.  The Buddha is really saying that our true self is other than these illusory Five Aggregates; and that we should have a revulsion towards them instead of the self!  This book deserves careful scrutiny.  And let the beginner beware, this book draws a terribly nihilistic conclusion about Buddhism.  It is ironic to note that three months before the Buddha dies he said the following: "My life is fully ripe, my life is at an end, I shall depart from you, I have made a refuge for the self. 
 You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: "You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, "it's a drag, a well-known drag... 
 Colson's version of what happened during Watergate is a self-serving, sanctimonious whitewash of what he did and what he was responsible for. As the self-syled " Go-to guy" when something needed to be done. As Howard Hunt's boss, it defies belief that he was ignorant of what went on. He managed to get away without any responsibility for what he was surely guilty of and plead guilty to a crime of his choosing, which he hoped not to serve any time for.Surely to be "Born Again" he needs to tell the whole truth rather than this sanitized version 
  On the release of "Ashanti", the artist became a major name with the release of the popular single "Foolish". Many believed Ashanti was the new major name of R&B, a more modern (and less capable) Mary J. Blige. It is because of this hype about the singer that the album is such a dissapointment. Each song on the album has a similar sound and sounds very like it was produced by Irv Gotti and the rest of Murder Inc. The constant interruptions of Irv Gotti and other Murder Inc members doesn't complement Ashanti's voice and the album would have sounded much better if it only contained her voice.    1. "Intro"- Unnecessary filler that contains samples of past songs Ashanti has featured in. Poor opening to the album.  2. "Foolish"- The best song on the album and a clear choice for the first single. Good production and good vocals by Ashanti.  3. "Happy"- A little immature but still a solid effort by Ashanti. The use of Ja Rule was unnecessary at the start of the song. Catchy chorus.  4. "Leaving (Always On Time Part 2)"- Unnecessary sequel to "Always On Time". Sounds very similar to the original only the original was much better.  5. "Narative Call (Interlude)"- Terrible interlude that was put on to fill the album.  6. "Call"- Nice beat and good enough lyrics. Does grow tiresome after a while.  7. "Scared"- Sounds very like it was produced by Irv Gotti and contains unnecessary bad language. Would have been better without Irv Gotti in it. It is still a decent track and Ashanti's voice complements it.  8. "Rescue"- A very good production and a generally good song although the music goes on for far too long at the end. Ashanti's vocals are quite similar to the tracks before.  9. "Baby"- I don't know why she released this track. It's so corny and the lyrics are awful. The production isn't great either.  10. "VooDoo"- Annoying interlude at the start and the track that follows is quite bland. The chorus isn't any way special and Ashanti's vocals become annoying at this point.  11. "Movies"- A very R&B song that works well although it isn't well made. Bad lyrics but what can you expect with such an immature R&B release.  12. "Fight (Over Skit)"- Awful use of time on a record. It is just an excuse to use as much bad language as possible in a minute. There shouldn't be a need for spoken interludes on a good record.  13. "Over"- Slightly bland. Ashanti's voice doesn't really suit the song that well.  14. "Unfoolish"- Very similar to "Foolish". Still it is a nice track to add to the album as it adds something unusual, Biggie's verse.   15. "Shi Shi (Skit)"- We don't want to hear Ashanti's sister saying nothing for a few seconds. Awful.  16. "Dreams"- A nice idea but turns out to be very cheesy.   17. "Thank You"- Ashanti doesn't manage her vocals well on this track and it is too short. Should have been left off.   Overall there is far too much filler on the album to make it decent. Ashanti would have been much better if she had been signed to another record label and taken her time with her first record instead of releasing this rushed job. The most interesting thing on the album is the images which is always a bad sign. She does show potential as a singer and could release something of significance in the future. Until then I would reccomend people to avoid this rushed job and anything she has released since (and possibly download some of the singles). There are much better comtemporary R&B singers out there.   MARK- 3/1 
 Ehrman's work is not for a person of faith. It does not take faith into consideration. It is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified; and none which can be validated. I read it as an immediate follow-up to his work "Lost Scriptures" - Books that did not make it into the New Testament. I was warned by my minister who is also a Bible scholar and has two Ph.D.'s - and my minister was correct. In Lost Christianities, Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the New Testament by implying that many New Testament books may be false, forged, translated incorrectly, altered to serve a purpose, etc... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament. Ehrman's Lost Christianities starts out strong, but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader. If for nothing else, it is an attempt to test your faith, but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith. The book leads one to believe that the author is as much a Bible critic as he claims to be a scholar. He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed. However, the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does. To save you the time and money, simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be. Ehrman and other Bible critics (ie., The DeVinci Code) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story. Save your money and give it to your church instead.  Gary 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 As a longtime basketball fan, I was at first anxious to see what I would find in a tell all novel of one of the best rebounders and all around defensive players of the game.  What I found was horrible talk about women and other players.  Rodman's racist comments against white people are enough to scoff at no matter what color a persons skin is.  His comments of "black" players being better than whites is just a terrible shameful label to put upon all of those who play the game.  Would have loved to hear what Larry Bird, John Stockton, and Jerry West had to say when they heard that one!  Rodman does talk in depth of the family he lived with for some of his life and I commend him for that.  The only downfall to this is the fact he didn't seem to learn from them anything about class or manners.  If you are looking for a book about a "worm" then you've come to the right place.  If your looking for a book about the wonderful game of basketball as told by one of it's greatest players, I suggest that you look elsewhere.  
 I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this 
 A book that is very poorly written, doesn't present any valuable and thoughtful information, focuses on many other external and quite secondary issues - Anne's issues, very repetitive on many occasions, and extremely poorly executed.   In my opinion, as other reviewers have already mentioned, Anne was simply struggling to get into the spotlight most likely because her life was quite insignificant, and she was dying for attention. Anne is a person with many, many issues herself, which makes it difficult for her to write a story about someone else without bringing the focus over and over again onto her and her life as whole. It seems as Anne's main reasoning for writing this book is to assure her readers how closely she grew with her biological mother and how close she was with Laci and her brother Scott (if she really was that close - where did all the loyalty toward her biological mother and brother go?!!! The spotlight was more important, I guess!). When one reads the book, one can gather that she wasn't close at all but wanted and wished that she were -- for the same reason that I mentioned in the beginning -- just to be in the spotlight.   The list -- I didn't understand why the book's title was chosen to be named after that silly two pages of writing, which is probably the worst part of the book to begin with. The things that are listed are as a reasoning of a 10-year old kid. An adult could, and when writing a book, should do better!   This book is artificial, exaggerated, and childish-reasoned! It is just another way of trying to bring some variety into someone's quite boring and monotonous life. 
 Like many folks who were born too late to catch televison's greatest shows when they first aired, but old enough to remember the pre-DVD era, I had previously only been familiar with the Twilight Zone through the magic of reruns and holiday marathons, and was thus unable to discern one season from another.   It's one of the greatest, most inventive shows of all time. I don't think many people would argue that. But someone's gotta say it - with a few notable exceptions, Season 3 is a real stinker.   First, there are an abundance of the 'silly' episodes - Twilight Zone fans will know the ones I'm talking about. You can usually tell from the soundtrack. Lighthearted, goofy episodes such as Season 3's "The Fugitive," "Once Upon a Time" (which gets an E for effort for featuring the brilliant Buster Keaton way past his prime), and "Showdown with Rance McGrew" are all pleasant enough, but not haunted with the same kind of masterful irony that the show is rightfully celebrated for.  Still, these whimsical diversions are absolute blockbusters compared to the myriad of dull, lifeless episodes here. If you can't figure out the 'twists' to episodes like "The Mirror," "the Jungle," "Quality of Mercy," "The Passersby," "One More Pallbearer," "The Little People," "Four O Clock" and "Young Man's Fancy" within the first three minutes, maybe the OC is more your speed. Even worse are the dunderheaded, offensively preachy episodes like "Deaths Head Revisited" and "Still Valley." No wonder you never see these in syndication - they stink. Then there are the flat out awful epsiodes, like "Little Girl Lost," which almost certainly inspired the movie Poltergeist, but is still laughably awful anyway.   There are some classics here - I'd count "It's A Good Life" and "To Serve Man" as some of the series's best - but they are in short supply, and chances are, if you're reading this, you're probably already quite familiar with these episodes.   File under: creatively bankrupt.     
 The author has done a lot of research and talked with many experts. Unfortuntely, he builds on this with too many unwaranted assumptions and jumps to too many conclusions. Sometimes his information is obviously wrong.  For instance, he says that pets, unlike infants, have no need for language so we don't hyperarticulate (draw out) our vowels when talking to pets as we do with infants. Nonsense. Listen to anyone training a dog and you'll hear, " Goo-o-o-od bo-o-o-y." Dogs have linquistic needs; they don't need to learn to talk, but we do want them to learn to listen.   He also proposes that when hominids became bipedal "they got rhythm," leading us to musical ability.  Silly. Four-legged animals have a natural rhythm, too. Think of horses. They have a natural walking gait, a four-beat trot and a three-beat canter, and they settle into the rhythm that's easiest for them to maintain. Rhythm is inherent to movement, whether we were walking on fours or upright.  He makes obvious logic errors, too. He posits that because few Neandertal adults survived beyond 35, grandmothers would have been rare. Please. Mother at 13, grandmother at 26. It's fairly common that people who die young mature early, and he should know that.  He argues that Neandertals had no language because their culture would not have remained so stable. That ignores ideas such as this: a difficult life inhibits invention; when you are struggling to survive you have little time to invent, and you can't afford the mistakes which come from trying many new things. Also, witness the Japanese master/apprentice system that keeps craft work methods and styles similar for thousands of years -- in a culture with language.  All in all, it is annoying that he has collected so much information and then abused it. On top of  which, the tone of his writing is arrogant and egotistical -- and that intrudes on the reading of the book and thinking about it. Too bad 
 Mediumship is highly dangerous, and tricky. I find it irresponsible of this publishing company to promote a book which could have been written under false pretenses, or by a seriously imbalanced individual so deluded he believes he is talking to John Lennon's spirit, which, logically would be virtually impossible, due to so many "mediums," real and fake, trying to call him up for this specific purpose..To continue to cash in on his misfortune and lost life. To the true author...Who do you think you're fooling?! To the rest...Wake up, if you want to honour John Lennon's memory, watch "Imagine". If you want to learn about the afterlife, read Sylvia Browne 
      The book Many Lives, Many Masters tells a fascinating story.  I am thankful to the book especially for all these reviews, that are about far more than the book itself. They show a beautiful wide rainbow of states of mind.  Our Mind.  The single heart and soul warming story in this book creates many new questions for all of us, who are on our way to the spiritual awakening, trying to access the higher levels of our consciousness.  There are many people, who already KNOW, what the others only BELIEVE, or want to know or believe.   On our way there and in your quest for more, I recommend reading the book "I am me I am free" by DAVID ICKE, who shares his great experiences and knowledge in his very special own unique fantastic and loving way.      Congratulations to all of us.  We deserve to be admired and praised.    FIVE STARS to EVERY ONE OF US and still, let's shoot for more!!!   And, not to worry.  All we don't learn here, we will find out exactly how it is, when the right time comes.  It will be even much nicer, than we now think.  Wanna bet 
 There's nothing really scientific on this book. It's only a great fiction work really. Almost comic most of the time. Have that in mind when you read it 
 I don't know what is up w/ Marilyn Lee when it comes to her black heroines. They are so weak minded and pitiful. Sharde has been pining for her boss from afar for years. She decides to take advantage of their retreat at Jeff's cabin and seduce him. Although he tells her he's not looking for a serious relationship, she lies by saying she can respect his feelings. However she plays along in a deceitful manner resulting in immature head games and shameful manipulation. Her deception was so bad that she drove Jefferson away because her dishonesty from day one about her true intentions with him. She was truly unlikable.   Another thing, what's up w/ these black women characters who fail to use protection and coerce these white male lovers not use a condom? With the terrifying stats on black women contracting HIV I find this appalling. I understand this is fiction but I think it really does send the wrong message. Lee has done this before with previous black female characters who seem to have an aversion to safer sex. The best love story she wrote was The Talisman where the lovers used protection and the story still came off erotic.  My friend forwarded me her followup to this book and unfortunately Darbie her faithful assistant has followed in the same footsteps of not wanting to use a condom, and this is from a woman who is having a one-night stand with a strange man who happened to share her hotel room by accident. I won't give anymore away but the man in question is already in this book.   I also feel Lee needs to move beyond the taboo factor of white men and black women being romantically involved and just tell a story where race is not being analyzed to death on the black woman character's  part. It will improve Lee as a writer to deal with men and women relationships w/o the black woman having all these kind of racial hang-ups . Lee also makes these black women violent, oftentimes they are hitting their white male lovers. She is a black woman herself so I don't understand why she falls victim to the historic racist sexual stereotypes black women have been given by white society. 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
  NOTE: pay attention to the distinction between the ratings.   Either it's 5 STARS or it's 1 STAR. very little in between.  Why is that? The 5 star people appear invested in her book, many of them make their living talking about CHANGE Management and business related issues. Some of them talk about being personally associated with the author or her personal interests. Is this relevant data for a book review? If what they want is to write fan letters, then they should do so on their time. Or if they want to set up a BLOG and yammer their platitudes, they can do that. But a review should be that, a thoughtful discussion of the merits, the good and the bad of any work. The 5 star people appear wholly unable to be neutral. In my opinion, too many people here are economically motivated:  a) to be seen as an authority in this forum,   b) to flatter their colleagues and   c) by the publisher to post exceedingly glowing reports.  What I would suggest is that the lack of nuance from the supporters and the over-the-top praise suggests payola.  The negative reviews give far more insightful and substantive review --which in this case is deservedly negative.  I give more weight to the negative reviews if only for their discussion of the BOOK itself, and not their personal opinions of the author, her sports agenda, their lovely luncheon last year, etc 
 Ming has a good idea: Take one basic "master recipe" and apply it to three or more different dishes. Fantastic! Applying general concepts like this is the basis of learning to be a real cook. I'm sure that the concept would be a great boon to many home chefs.   Unfortunately Ming himself is far too irritating to watch for long. His tendancy to be a smug, overbearing, know-it-all and impatient to boot render his show unwatchable by anyone but a Business School frat boy.   If this guy has a book you should buy it and skip the heinous alpha-male kitchen posturing (with a ceramic chef knife) 
 After you strip away that which is intuitively obvious...there's not much here. There are some betting strategies if you're the type to bet $300 on a Pick 3 or $2,500 on a Pick 6. Otherwise, I'd give this book a miss 
 I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend. 
 If you are a fan of the movie Rio Bravo, and what you are looking for is the songs you heard, as you heard them in the movie, then stay away from this product.  I didn't listen to the other reviewers, thinking it couldn't be that bad.  I was wrong.  The difference between these versions and the movie tracks is so pronounced that it is very upsetting.  I only listen to the tracks from other westerns.  Those at least have some value 
 There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...    
 This one was really hard to get through.  It was slow and contemplative to the edge of comatose.  I stuck with it to the end because I was determined to piece together a definable plot and/or message.  Finally, in the last thirty pages of the book, something came together.  But I would not recommend this book...for the Pulitzer or for a book club 
 This is a very mediocre Salsa Dance DVD and the price is too high.  For starters, the colors used in filming this DVD are very depressing and this guy (the instructor) would not shut up ... you can't even hear the music.  All you hear is one two three, one two threee .. 
 I was thoroughly unhappy with Fort in "My Lady Notorious."  I was not especially excited to read about him in "Something Wicked," but the reviews were promising.  I should have stuck with my first instinct.  This book was incredibly boring.  I found most of it to be about the plot against the king.  I prefer not to have a whole lot of subplots in my romance novels.    Fort was not a likable hero.  He sired two children out of wedlock and only supported them financially.  What a jerk!  I don't care if that was how things worked in the mid-18th century - I prefer my heroes to be a little more noble than that.  Elf bordered on desperate.  Fort didn't deserve the attention or pursuit she afforded him.  I think Fort should have realized his folly and pursued Elf.  He was the jerk all along and should have been the one to lose his pride and pay the price.  Fort thoroughly debauches Elf and her brothers barely batted an eye.  It seemed out of character for all of the Mallorens.  And speaking of out of character, where was Elf's spunk?  She became a doormat and showed very little backbone in dealing with Fort.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have commented on this book's sizzle.  I have to say - I completely disagree.  There were only a couple of sex scenes and they were short and very undetailed.  If you are someone who likes vague, veiled sex scenes, this book's for you.  The ending seemed abrupt and a disappointing ending for such a long, drawn-out story.  I wouldn't waste my time with this one 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 While I will give the author A for effort, this is a rehash of the same old prosperity principles.  There are a few alterations, such as the Heart Map instead of the Wheel of Fortune. The anecdotes are unimpressive, the writing trite and the exercises uninspiring.  Readers interested in manifesting abundance would do better by turning to the old standards.  Joseph Murphy and Catherine Ponder may be dated but are still effective.  The Abraham material by Esther and Jerry Hicks is fresh and useful.  Joe Vitale covers the same  principles in his sprightly style, which is emminently more readable that the instant offering. Lynn Grabhorn translates the Abraham teachings in a user-friendly style in Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting.  The author, a counselor and social worker, gets bogged down in relationships and psychological angst. Unloading old baggage, getting in touch with the inner child and the like have all been addressed before with greater effect. Her handling of these subjects is heavy handed and annoying. I  found nothing original here, only a clumsy rendition of the same old stuff. 
 Being an avid Spot fan for many years now I was eager to get my hands on Where's spot.  Unlike its predecessors I was bitterly dissapointed.  The plots were too simplistic, the characters as believable as England winning the Word cup this year.  The one thing that really made me cringe was the author's literary zest...or lack therof. It was as though this novel was written for children.  I found this book to be predictable, boring and condescending.  *sigh 
 Instead of being titled "property and freedom," it should be titled "property and power." Pipes was a prominent old cold-war apologist for American capitalism, and you can tell that he is still trapped in his little world of false-dichotomy.   Pipes overall argument is contrived, and with the exception of his knowledge of Russian history, superficial. Most of his time is spent criticizing the Stalinist Soviet Union, while at the same time lacking any thoughtful rebuttal to Marx's critique of capitalism.  His title claim, that freedom cannot exist without private property, is weak philosophically and logically. He has poor insight into the nature of freedom and presonal responsibilty. He would really benefit by reading some Sartre or Nietzche, before trying to describe his own made up idea freedom. His attempts to link economic thought with philosophy and history fail miserably. He barely exposes the actual writings of Marx. This is incredibly unfortuante since most "real-world" capitalists, such as wealthy Wall street brokers, know that Marx understood capitalism better than any of its supporters. His philosophical support is all anecdotal with no real thoughtful analysis. His historical summary, although detailed with Russia, leaves much to be desired. He fails to discuss slavery, prostitution, or even slumlords, all which flourish under American capitalism.   Although some might find his credentials enough to accept his flimsy argument, I for one was greatly disappointed. I realize that property is linked to power, but freedom is something completely different.   I'm sure many right-wing folks will look past all of this flaws in this books and embrace it. I'm sure the paternalistic allure of an established Harvard professor will cause some to avoid challenging the views in his book.    But I'm not trying to convince those people. Look past the credentials, the excessive use of footnotes to appear more "academic" ( a clear sign of a writer who is insecure of his own beliefs!), and the comfort of someone who agrees with your agenda, and you will discover shallow puerile nonsense 
 This might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer. There is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property. Even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of Tarantino's "Kill Bill" films, his salute to the genre, or "Reservoir Dogs," which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence. "Bullet ..." is little more than two hours of broken glass, fire, blood squirts, amputation, beatings and explosions. This makes Gladiator look like a Sunday school picnic. The characters are totally flat, one-dimensional. There is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc. The acting is weak, static, despite the fact that I don't understand a word of Cantonese. We are presented with a series of stereotypes (the hooker with a heart of gold, the good friend, the crazy friend and the bad friend). Unfortunately the American stereotype of the Viet Cong as madmen  -- and Saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of Viet Nam during the American occupation. The worst thing is that -- because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you don't care what happens to the characters. So I'll tell you and then you won't have to finish watching the film: they kill each other.  My advice-- skip it 
 We bought this thinking it would be a great product.  We were able to get steam out of it for awhile, but we had to nurse it along.  At times it drained out onto the carpet; other times it produced no steam. Even with nusing it, the humidifier broke down after three months and now we can't use it at all.  Hope others have better luck with it than we did.  
 This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 THE TOMMYKNOCKERS is one of the more unsuccessful of Stephen King adaptations to hit the screen.  Originally a 1993 tv miniseries, the movie suffers from lackluster direction, mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror.  Typically set in a homey little New England town, the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer (Marg Helgenberger) who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend(a poorly cast Jimmy Smits) decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed.  Meanwhile, a ghostly green light emits from the object, causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another, whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes.  At three hours, THE TOMMYKNOCKERS definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take; it can become redundant.  Tighter direction and a more focused cast could have helped but aside from John Ashton, EG Marshall and Joanna Cassidy in supporting roles, most of the performances seem phone in, and Traci Lords is ridiculously hilarious as the postal slut.  A real misfire 
 Two major Brooklyn neighborhoods, Mill Basin and Bergen Beach are misssing from this book. This is a typical result of the recent gentrification "Yuppie Invasion" in Park Slope/Green Point/Downtown Brooklyn. These two neighborhoods must be too blue collar, and far away from Manhattan, and so get overlooked in this book.  A sad and glaring ommission 
 I have read through this book cover to cover twice in an attempt to tease out gems of insight. The information is there, but the extremely compact writing style and poor layout make the endeavor difficult. In addition, the examples are very superficial. When I've got a question about SystemC I consult the LRM (IEEE 1666)  and I rarely go back to this book 
 Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace.  My significant other did the same.  I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty.  Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.  I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences.  I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early.  Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy") 
    Since I do a lot of driving, I bought this as an audio book to hopefully ease the pain of sitting in traffic. This book is more irritating than traffic jams.          The heroine in the book, if you can call her that, was not at all likable. She was arrogant and in my opinion, her arrogance made her foolish. For example, when a police detective she was working with telephoned her on her cell and asked her where she was she responded with a smart remark rather than tell him where she was. Why? Simply because she did not personally like him.  Moments later she was knocked out and taken captive. Later when she woke up she bemoaned the fact that no one knew where she was. Dumb! And this is only one example of her stupidity. Ironically, earlier in the book she referred to this police detective and his partner as tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum. Later, this same policeman saved her life, but she still was unappreciative and belittled him even when it was pointed out to her that the man saved her life.       The "heroine" also had a Canadian boyfriend who pretended he was a cowboy throughout the entire book. I thought maybe the author had just seen "Pillow Talk" with Rock Hudson pretending to be Rex Stetson while she was writing this book. It was bad.       The "heroine" had been separated from her husband for years but failed to obtain a divorce. She seems to have a hard time taking care of unfinished business and she constantly complains about everything.      The author bores the reader with long, drawn out descriptions to the point the reader or listener is screaming, "Okay, I get it! It's hot outside!" If that weren't bad enough, readers or listeners of this book are subjected to lectures on how we evolved from apes and endangered turtles. If I wanted to read about endangered turtles I would go to the non-fiction section. To add insult to injury, the big mystery in the book, the disappearance of an entire family, turned out to be a complete non-mystery.       I was determined to listen to the whole thing but finally, on the last half of the tape, after enduring another political lecture, I could take it no more. I took the tape out and threw the entire thing in the trash.          I have read thousands of books and I've listened to probably more than 60 audio books.  This was the absolute worse of the lot.  If you want to read or listen to a good forensic mystery, stick with Patricia Cornwell and her Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Cornwell's books are worth reading!  
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 I agree with this guys ex-wife. He can't do anything right. Hope he wasn't as bad a diplomat as he is an author. Maybe he should go back to bartending. The old adage that "If you don't know a subject teach a course about, if you still don't know write a book about it" totally failed here! It was a total waste of time and money. 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 I think it would have been better in print, some of the concepts are hard to follow on tap 
 This book is cute, but not much help for little ones to ease their move. It does show that all the boxes get packed and go to a new house which will be better.  But it doesn't say that it will be better for the kids, just for the parents 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 If by some mischance this were the first Naipaul novel you ever read, I doubt you'd read another. Not that it's an empty book or a stupid book! It's just not a well-crafted novel. The early novels, like The Suffrage of Elvira and Miguel Street, were exuberantly funny and picturesque. The later novel, like Bend in the River and Guerrillas, were powerful depictions of the sicknesses of our times. In between came A House for Mr. Biswas, surely one of the greatest novels of the century, in a sense the last Victorian novel that could justifiably be written. Following Guerrillas, it seemed that Naipaul's analytic mind thoroughly displace his imagination, and the best of his later books are all "non-fiction", often in the form of extended travel essays. A gentle introduction to the ferocity of Naipaul's world-view would be A Turn in the South, his only book about the USA. Perhaps he should never have returned to the novel, the craft of which I think he no longer enjoys. Be that as it may, Naipaul is one of the greatest English writers of the century, more than deserving of the recognition of the Nobel Prize 
 This book was on the bestseller's shelf at my local bookstore.  I asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews.  Shocking.  As a number of other customer's have commented on this site, this book was not worth the money it cost.  It was silly, contrived and unrealistic.    The cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time.  I typically don't read romance novels but I can't begin to imagine that that's possible.  
 ...I never review books on Amazon, but for this one, I just had to. I'm a huge Monroe fan, have been for many years. When you've read enough books and watched enough docs, you understand this woman was extremely complex and not an angel, but another wonderous human being with extraordinary talents. However, I picked this book up at my local book store because the curiousity got the best of me. First of all, if these transcripts are legit from Monroe's last tapes to her psychiatrist then I feel guilty reading something so personal that was never meant to be heard. And then on top of that angry at the publishers/writers who took this private info and made a book out of it (tho they claim they did this to clear Greenson and let Marilyn's voice be heard to prove she was in no state that would have caused suicide). Regardless, it's private info and quite frankly - disturbing at that. Like I said, i've read some hard core truths about Monroe but it never tarnished my thoughts of her as woman, as a human being...but in these transcripts (and i'll say again IF they are real) this is a woman who truly refers to herself in 3rd person ALOT, much more than the expected or norm, a person who goes on about enemas (such a private topic I can't believe they published it and i'm saddened I gave in and read it), a woman who is obsessed with Shakespeare, obsessed with many different things, obsessed with the Kennedy's and how to "break it off". I've read transcripts from other interviews with her and in my opinion, this "voice" of MM in this book (to me), does not match up. However that said, it's not totally unrelated to what MM might have sounded like. It's the voice of a woman who sounds like she is spliting in two, cracking straight down the middle. My heart broken, I wish I'd never picked the darn book up. I'm promptly throwing it in my garbage can this evening.. 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 This young fellah has an incredibly deep voice, and could very well develop into a top "country star". Unfortunately, first he has to develop a DIRECTION. Every single song on this CD is derivative -- there's not one original note to be found here. The poor guy is probably getting twisted left and right by his manager, producers, and record company to copy everybody from Garth to Alan. The song "Good People" is begging the audience to pretend he's Garth singing "Friends In Low Places", even down to the bar-room singalong. And the song about Mama makes me want to toss my cookies. But I had already puked when I heard "Long, Slow Kisses" so I didn't have anything left to vomit. JEFF: You don't have to do this kinda pablum, dude! Look up the word "cloying" in the dictionary and don't be it! Next time out, see if you can find some FRESH songs and a direction of your own -- something that makes you stand out from all the other country cliches! Stop walking the same path that has been trod by the others. You have the voice -- you just need a direction 
 Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor! 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 If your not an Absolute Beginner...  If you have at least some background with programming...  This book probably is not for you.  I'm only through the first 9 chapters of this book and I'm having a hard time staying awake while reading it...  Perhaps if I was a true beginner I'd appreciate his methods, but to me it seems like the author was paid by the word.  Which is to say he uses three paragraphs to say one sentence of meaningful information. And he repeats himself several times (at least in the first three chapters of the book)  I wish the guys who wrote the PHP manual could do one for VBScript 
 Like most GPX radios this offers much and doesn't deliver. Reception is very poor at best and the lack of batteries other than the built-in and non-removable rechargeables makes no sense at all, you can't just pop in a couple of alkalines and use it. You must wait for it to charge or turn the handle. Could pose a problem when the buit-in batts stop holding a charge.  I returned mine within hours of the purchase 
 This book, short and terse, takes a reproachful tone and minimalist explanation style. My biggest crticism, though, is its lack of challenging words. Those who have no trouble telling apart "incite" from "insight," "disparage" from "disparate," and "plum" from "plumb" aught to look elsewhere to satisfy their intellectual curiousities. I was wholly disappointed with this book, but very glad to have found a replacement for it called "The Bibliophile's Dictionary," which is in every way superior.  This book is a reference for the laity and, in my unintentionally high-brow opinion, should be skipped 
 Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes.  PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some "bad stuff" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT 
 Although described as a hardcover, I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and there was NOTHING in it that was not in the Dragonolgy text.  It was also NOT a hardback, but a little pamphlet in a box with a cheap bit of plastic token.  Definetly not of the quality of Dragonolgy 
 I heard that Leonard Maltin was putting 1960 & older films in a separate book so I decided to purchase a copy along with the annual movie guide. When I started looking through the 2006 edition, I noticed that there were still hundreds of 1960 & older films still listed. So I decided to compare both guides page by page. The same old films are listed in BOTH guides! I feel totally ripped off.    
 XML is changing at a lightning fast pace, and this 2000 book is already out of date 
 I have had to read this text for a doctoral level curriculum class. Frankly, it is a very dry, uninteresting presentation of curriculum theory and models. This is a serious flaw, considering this is a textbook designed to instruct learners how to design effective and stimulating curriculum. In addition, the authors do not seem to understand their audience. They appear to be directing their instruction toward business, industry and technology. However, there is an occasional reference toward educators, hardly recognizing that curriculum instruction is directly related to context of area concentration. The shifting back and forth between learning theories and characteristics in list format is distracting. A good text should act as a tool for guidance. This one totally misses the mark. 
 "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..." Oh my God was this book a snoozer. What a waste of time 
 This magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than $100 on babya outfits, etc.   It is not a magazine for most of America, but rather for the elite, or those who wish to pretend they are.   There are way too many ads, and insignificant articles.   Parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category. 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 I have the Water Dog DVD and Book and purchased the Game Dog DVD and book.  The book for both is outstanding.  The Game DOG and Water DVD is the same video on DVD.  Do not waste your dollars and purchase both DVD's.  It is a waste of good money.  Purchase Game Dog only.  I have not seen Gun Dog but wanted something more with Upland dog training.  Maybe Gun dog is the trick.  
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 I thought I had found my utopia for writers block when I bought this ($25) and took it home. I tried the writing devices in the book and found it awkward, clunky and that it didn't serve the purpose it was supposed too. I don't know what people are talking about with software, I had none. "Plots, Unlimited"  is like a flaky friend, it wants to help, but never follows through.  Like others has said, the "plots" read like a movie on Oxygen! or some movie-of-the-week. They've been recycled and are all but unusuable. I don't know what I was thinking buying this for $25, but I regret it now. I think my writers block blinded me.  At any rate, you might be able to piece together some of these plots to make an interesting story, but the way you're supposed to use the book the way he explains it is confusing, in my opinion.   Some plots are interesting, some silly, some stupid, some been done to death. Save your money, and always spend some time in the bookstore with any writing guide first. 
 I have been a Coulter fan for 20+ years and I eagerly await each new release. After reading all of the reviews I decided not to buy this book.  However, I found it for a $.01 and couldn't turn down the deal.  In retrospect, I should have saved my penny and thrown it into the fountain at the nearest mall.  I would have made a wish that Catherine Coulter could still write books the way she used to.  Don't waste your money even if it's only a penny.... 
 I have never read dialogue so contrived in my entire life. The tension between Adam and Becca had not point of origin. The tension between Adam and Tyler was stereotypical, to say the least. The way the author ridded the characters and reader of any residual guilt/frustration/regret in regards to Tyler was totally unrealistic and disgustingly half-hearted. Such a cop out! The entire "love" story was based on notions of "Gee, you're hot! I wanna have sex with you! We must be in love!" When, at a rather crucial moment Adam said "Even my molecules are horny" I stood up, threw the book across the room, and laughed for ten mintues straight. I didn't keep it or sell it; I threw it in the bin where it belongs. It was utter trash 
 I bought this attachment after discovering that the base of my new Dyson vacuum stood too high off the floor to be used under and around furniture. The attachment cleans as promised, but I have decided that using it is more trouble than it's worth.    The attachment connects to the wand (not to the base), which requires a several step process to use it, back and forth, as you clean the floors. It is bulky (12" x 10.5" x 7") and there's no built-in place to store it on the vacuum, so it's taking up a lot of shelf space in my cleaning closet (and I have to carry it around with me from room to room, as I clean.)    Dyson makes a great vacuum, with especially brilliant design features - it's disappointing that the standard vacuum doesn't allow for under-furniture cleaning, which should be a basic.  And this attachment doesn't really make up for it.    After using the floor-tool attachment a few times, I decided to rely upon my Roomba, instead, for the areas that the Dyson (without attachment) can't cover - the Roomba does a much better job of going around chair legs, etc., and I don't have to be there!   If I had it to do over, I wouldn't have purchased this item - put your $$ toward a robot cleaner. :-)  
 I didn't make it to the end of this slow-paced, excruciatingly detailed novel. The characters, Jew and Arab alike, were more stereotypes than real human beings. The scenes written from the killer's point of view were embarrassingly overwritten; I don't like this technique as a rule, but these were among the worst I've seen. I'm a fan of richly detailed settings and slow-moving plots when a book is written well enough and has characters whose side stories are interesting enough, but this one didn't make the grade.   On a side note to those who have criticized this book's racist portrayal of overtones: I felt that the tone of the book was meant to reflect the prejudices of the main character. Maybe I'm attributing too much subtlety to Kellerman in assuming this was all intentional, but it would have been pointlessly naive for him to put pro-Arab sentiments in the mind of a conservative Israeli Jew 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 The problem with all Indian cultural analysts living outside India including those writing on cinema is that while they fulfill a mandatory understanding of the cultural theories in vogue at the undergraduate level  in the US, Europe and Australia, they display a singular lack of  sensitivity while dealing with the material at hand. Their survival,  therefore, depends almost entirely on their reader's lack of knowledge of  the field of study which will include amongst other things the native  language, the local history as well as the local lores. On all these counts  Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose.  There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the  relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.  There are descriptions - such as the music composer SD Burman being  described as a baul singer - which are downright ridiculous. And, of  course, her command of the Hindi language is unquestionably poor! Surely  the West and the East deserve a better introduction to the Indian cinema  than this book 
 When I ordered this book, I was expecting something along the line of high protein, low carb meals with no more than 9-15 grams of fat per serving.  I was disappointed to find that a majority of what the book was recommending was 28+ grams of fat per serving.  I commend anyone that has lost 60 pounds on a diet, as I have lost over 100 pounds myself, but if you are wanting to look like a model from a fitness magazine, I don't think you will achieve such results on this particular diet. It does,  however have some neat suggestions that you could modify to a lower fat version, and could be a very good diet plan if your doctor has told you that carbs are causing medical problems for you 
 I have yet to see a honest approach to this complex subject that does other than portray the Jews as victims.  There is never any acknolwedgement that all people and, yes, all races/cultures, at time do very bad things to each other.  Except for the Jews.  With them it is always someone else's fault. Even now, as they do their best to destroy the Palestinians, after invading their homes, stealing their dignity and turning Gaza into another Warsaw Ghetto, they refuse to admit that what they are doing is wrong.  And let's not forget that the Arabs are also semites, when we go throwing that "anti-semite" ajective around.  There are Jews who recognize and speak out on this problem, such as Norman Finklestein and Gore Vidal.  And there are, thankfully, Jewish run organizations in Israel who are fighting for the human rights of the Palestinians, realizing that it is the ongoing mistreatment of others, the continuing claim that Israel is above reproach, that is creating a negative image of Israel - they are doing this to themselves.  They are their own worst enemy.  
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 How can someone get something so wrong, and yet still have apologists who defend him, and believers who buy his books?  There's lots of money to be made in Doomsday predictions if you can rationalize taking the money from the fools that will buy your pitch.  This books predicts the world will starve to death due to overpopulation.  Only problem, the predictions were made decades ago and they were all wrong. We're still here.  Maybe he can write a book on global warming.. 
 It's difficult to determine whom this book is addressed to. A lay reader will come out none the wiser after reading the chapters on complex numbers and groups. Just dressing up powerful general ideas in vague, mystifying, and allusive prose serves no purpose. For instance (p.81) he refers to the heart-breaking charm of complex analysis. Yeah, so? These statements don't edify a lay reader. The same can be said for the discussion of Lie groups (pp. 100-101).  A mathematician on the other hand, will find the book redundant, and annoying -- both for its inaccuracies and general, loose vagueness.  
 This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 This book will not give you any help into the mechanical workings of the human body.  The illustrations are weakly done in white chalk giving almost no basis of form.  I would now recommend spending the extra money for a  medical anatomy book breaking down all the muscles and bones for you.  I am  still astonished this is a reprint from the 70's, they should have just let  it go out of print and never brought there mistake back to life 
 This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer.  Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers.  Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included.  I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student 
 I purchased this book while taking an Intro to Java class thinking it was a Java programming book; it is not. While I will probably find it useful if ever I decide to start building web pages using Java applets for fun, it is definitely not for anyone looking to learn or understand Java PROGRAMMING. From this purchase, I have definitely learned the hard way to read all of the REVIEWS prior to purchasing any books.   Also, using the "Search Inside" tool (when available) to view the table of contents and the copyright date are a MUST for purchasing any future books!! I have used this function for several books and have been able to make better, more informed choices based on that information. If you have not used the "Search Inside" tool, I highly recommend doing so on your next purchase 
 I think if your decorating style is very "over the top" Brittish Proper, you may like this book.  While I liked looking through this book one or two times, it is not one that I take off the shelf for inspiration very often.  I didn't find any "secrets" on decorating in this book - except for putting fringe and tassles along the ceilings and in corners - YUCK!  It is a book with pictures and tips you would expect to find in a five dollar magazine 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly 
 I bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is pealing.I also discovered after I had water and coffee grounds all over,that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip properly.Hopefully, I can get my money back,and try another bran 
 pretty raw outlook in the life of Basquiat I'm an avid fan so i have no regrets having this 
 Read the fine (or missing) print carefully.  This is not a general purpose vacuum purchase.  You need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets (another $100).  If you want to return this item, they charge a restocking fee of 10% and also deduct for the shipment (even if you got "free" shipping) AND you pay to ship the thing back.  We ended up buying locally from Sears and are much happier with it than from Central Vacuum Stores - which is where the Miele came from.  
 This book combines exercises of Furey, Tsatsouline, Atlas and others but doesn't add anything. I bought these books previously but struggled to combine them into a system that allowed progression from beginner to advanced. This book's "transformetrics system" claims to do this but misses completely.   The progresson recommended is to add a chapter per week, but as the chapters are dedicated to a body part, its a poor way to progress.  If you are looking for a system, I suggest: - Craig Balantyne's Turbulence Training 6 month bodyweight manual - Alwyn Cosgrove's Program Design Manual + his bodyweight DVD  I give the book 2 stars because the exercises are excellent and its much cheaper than buying the books separately. I recommend it for someone who wants to tryout bodyweight exercies and is already in shape (as there are few beginners exercises) 
 They wouldn't let me give a review of 0 so a gave it one star. The film is broken up into five sections, for five different time periods, but none of them have any substance to them. There is a reason that this film was  smashed pretty hard when it was released. I'll watch pretty much anything,  but this remains the only movie that I've ever walked out of. I later  watched it again with a friend to prove that Williams really did a film  this bad, and it was worse the second time around. There is no reaseon to  see this film. If you looking for a good Williams picture, get "dead  poets. . " or "Good Will. . ." or even "What dreams[the  book is better though]."      This film is terrible, but not bad  enough to justify being watched to mock, such as "attack of the  killer..." or "THe Starfighters." There really is no reason  to see this film 
 This was bad enough for me to write my first review on Amazon. Quite simply, I ran out of digits to count economic fallacies. The author clearly was scavenging for data to prove his point. 
 This book reads like stereo instructions!  In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions.  Many terms are used but not defined.  Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible 
 Deep play (aka "Flow") is a valuable concept, but don't expect to find any intelligent exposition of it here. Instead, prepare for confusion as seemingly disparate phenomena -- rituals, hallucinations brought on by starvation, and Sunday morning reveries in the park -- are evinced as examples of "deep play". Just how and why these should be lumped together with creative flow is never adequately explained.   All in all, this is a rambling, entirely unsystematic and underresearched book, notwithstanding the author's credentials as a naturalist.* Worse still, as Wolfgang Pauli would say, it is "not even wrong". It has nothing to say, for page after page after page.   Well, not nothing exactly. As an indulgent exercise in vanity, it's worth a titter or two. The author, whose photo reveals a woman of a certain age in King Charles-style tresses, loses no opportunity to remind you the reader that she knows how to live. "I hate the fearful trimming of possibilities that age brings. If you lead a relatively narrow life, I suppose you never notice. But I've always been athletic"... etc etc. Mostly she goes on in this vein, larding up her exploits with new age musings that even I --liberal, female and eco-minded-- found eminently gagworthy. Reader be warned, though: a dark episode intrudes on page 100, as Ackerman takes NASA to task for having had the temerity to reject her for the Journalist in Space program. Her explanation: NASA feared she might say something "wise and profound."[!]  Whatever the case, don't hold your breath waiting for her to say it in this book.   *Serious readers of psychology would do better to consult Czikszentmihalyi's outstanding research on "Flow", while those interested in play in the natural world will adore Bernd Heinrich's Mind of the Raven 
 This book is one of the most difficult books I have ever read.  It seems to me that the author, Eleanor Duckworth, simply gathered a great deal of dreadfully boring, scientific information and put it in one pile.  For the most part, I feel like I had to read parts at least 3 times for it to make sense.  In all fairness, though, there are some good ideas in the book and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  The title is very much misleading, in my opinion.  It should have been called something like - "A CATALOGUE OF WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT WAS WONDERFUL IDEAS".  Good luck to all who attempt this one - know in advance what you are getting into and it might not be so bad 
 Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered  down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many  Live disks they did.  After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for  many years, is the only thing here to write home about when  one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later.  Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"...  Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid, but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned  out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80' 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 If I knew, at the time I saw this movie, that a lot of theaters give back refunds...I sure would have gotten one.  At least the popcorn was good!  Since I love Adrien Brody, I will give him another chance......This movie was nuts.  Skipping between scenes, you really had to be on your toes to figure out what in the world was happening.  
 Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out 
 I actually rate this book as absolutely ZERO stars.  There is ACCURATE information available 
 i have had this book in my library for a long time and very much looked forward to reading it. a book that got rave reviews by critics, an outstanding novelist (evan s connell) writing about the legendary downfall of custer at little bighorn, how could i go wrong with this one. well, i guess that there is no such thing as a sure thing, because i found this book way too long & way too tedious. the author digresses all throughout the book, dropping the narrative and taking off on dull useless sidetracks that should never have been included. dozens and dozens of characters are introduced that you will never rememeber (and will never need to remember). strange and poor organization make this book a real dud. too bad 
 The other reviewers here that reference their 13 year olds enjoying this book are absolutely right. This book is for 13 year olds. As a 25 year old trying to wrap his mind around programming, it leaves much to be desired.   If all you want is a gloss-over for someone who has no intention to continue in the field of programming, but just wants a non-programmers understanding of programming, this book is for you. If you want something you can take with you on a journey into real programming, you will have to really dig deep to distill the few morsels of theory offered here. In fact I had to reread most paragraphs dozens of times in order to find the underlying concept he was trying to teach; to find something that would still be useful to me after finishing the book.  Bottomline: A waste of time if you are out of high school and attempting to truly learn something about programming. Take a few minutes to skim thru the pictures at your local bookstore, then go buy a real programming book 
 This book revolves around two premises:  Good Girls please others, Gutsy Girls please themselves.  Whatever happened to focusing on results and what needs to be done at work?  An effective person, male or female, doesn't matter which, focuses on the tasks and strategies that advance the business' objectives instead of playing gamesmanship (or in this case, gameswomanship) with others.  Ms. White makes it sound so droll to be a "good girl" and denigrates her to no end, when in reality she is portraying a doormat straw-woman so that she can contrast with her "gutsy girl" persona who doesn't give a hoot about anyone but how she can get ahead and elbow her way to the top.  Modern business relies on teamwork and collaboration, and such a self-centered approach will not get the best long term results 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 I read Sleeping With Soldiers by Rosemary Daniell and found it disturbing. Like alcoholism or drug abuse, migratory sexuality is a true compulsive disorder and Daniell describes what a life of compulsive sexuality is  really like. Rosemary drank too much, tried drugs and engaged in a lot of  zipless sex as well as changing husbands. She had 3 husbands and 3 children  and a live in lover with whom she became pregnant and had an abortion. The  book is hard to describe. I seems to be a collection of previously  published articles and not a consistent voice. Sometimes it captures the  voice of people's speech patterns, other times it seems to brag about her  ability to have sex easily obtained and often that would make the reader  envious. Her ability to pick up men was the thrill of victory that became  the agony of defeat after a while. She claims to have been a cheer leader  in high school and the one with the most dates in the history of the  school. Really that popular 
 If you think "Knight of Fire" worth is a read because you enjoyed Shannon Drake's wonderful storyline and characters so much in "Princess of Fire" then don't bother. Unfortunately Knight of Fire is rather boring and the  characters are quite flat. Fallon and Alaric make an appearance, which is  why I bothered to read the book, I was more interested in seeing what had  happened to them in their later years.  If Drake writes another novel about  their children I hope it's about Robin their firstborn son but I'll have to  see what people in Amazon.com have to say about it before I bother to buy  it 
 In these days of real terrorism, we need real books not rehashed grad school junk.  Put this down and go for current journals.  PL or PU 
 I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"  
 If  JA Jance is Seattle's Dashiell Hammett, I am moving to San Francisco. This is pretty OK. But keep in mind I read Louis LaMour sometimes too. I am just not proud of it 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 I was forced to suffer through this rubbish in a college class. This book is merely propaganda packaged under a thin dust jacket of objectivity. The arguments are weak and contrived. Said seems to be just another appologetic for Islamic barbarism. The very premise for the book seems irrelevant -unfair potrayal of Islam in the western press. It's the very typical "don't believe what you see, believe what I say" sort of drivel that only appeals to mindless drones in dusty lands 
 A supposedly compassionate human being who boasts of a dog changing his life and then opting for the death of the dog...it is mind boggling to me, I can't believe it....but it is selling his books and I think it is cruel to the reader.  The world has enough tragedy, we don't need this 
 Another sax player who had as his sole influence guys like Kenny G.  This is just plain poor music by any standard.  There is no substance here 
 "Children of the Corn" had some potential: a "corn" cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in Nebraska. Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as "Alan Smithee," the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear. This Anchor Bay DVD is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound, though this is not the director's cut. 
 1. When I open the box. Found there is a loose screw in the heater. Meaning the product quality control has problem. 2. There is no handle to hold the heater. 3. There is no second heat temperature selection 
 Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short.  It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution.  But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate.  Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator 
 This DVD taught me that if you squeeze too much stuff on a dvd, the picture degrades. All three of the movies on this DVD have terrible resolution, which diminishes any opportunity for enjoyment. The resolution competes with the silly plots and terrible acting so I don't know what's worse. 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 After seeing Jon Kabat-Zinn on McLaughlin's One-on-One I was intrigued and decided to buy this book.  I was sorely disappointed. He makes some good observations (e.g. about ADD and the 24/7 lifestyle), but offers solutions based only on far-eastern philosophies (yoga, meditation, etc).  Not what I expected.  I would not recommend this book to devout Christians or Muslims.  Better stick with the Bible or the Koran, or the writings of accomplished Biblical or Koranic scholars 
 I've been hearing about Jason Moran for a while now and got a chance to hear this group live last night.  I echo what someone else said--the guitarist is lame--but then so is the bassist--and Jason Moran is a noodler.  He has nothing to say and he has no touch on the piano. If you like a lot of pointless noodling this is your record.  
 I've tried this one a few times, since I liked a previous model.  These are way too fragile and the plastic near the joint has broken within a week twice.  Last year's model was more durable.    The sound was good and they did keep a good sound after I had some very sweaty exercise.    But I've needed to keep the headphones together with tape, so I'm looking for another style 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 I bought this book based on the unanimous positive reviews here at Amazon.  I'm glad I got a used copy, because what I received is a volume of weak-minded New Age pabulum.  I thought it would be interesting to see how the symbols of the tarot might be used for shadow work, but I was expecting--hoping for?--something considerably more rigorous and credible, something with the clarity and common-sense applications of, say, a Robert A. Johnson book.  But, unlike Johnson, Jette is not an analyst, and so we get a lot of pseudo-pagan nonsense about casting circles of protection and crystals.  I can't take seriously declarations like, "Onyx can cause depression in some..." or "Rose quartz radiates universal love," or "Diamonds hold, absorb, magnify, and transmit pain." Is there really any clinical evidence to prove this, or is the author just passing along the standard gruel that she has read in other Llewellyn publications?   The author's method uses only the trump cards.  I guess the standard wisdom is that the major arcana represent archetypes, and the Jungian psychology on which shadow work is predicated also relies on archetypes, but that seems to be as much of a reason that we get for limiting ourselves to 22 of 78 cards.  It seems arbitrary an unnecessarily restrictive.  After all, the entire deck presents a much wider range of experience than the 22 cards do, and to limit ourselves to the major trumps just because they have been historically referred to as "archetypes" seems silly and illogical.  The unconscious--where the Shadow dwells--speaks the language of symbols, and there is no reason whatsoever to assume that it can only respond to the symbols presented in the trump cards.  The author claims to be non-sectarian in her presentation, but that seems to really mean that she is non-religious, at least in the sense of any mainstream religion.  But her repeated references to "Crone wisdom" and her exhortation to call upon "Crone power" during shadow work belie that.  The rituals she presents use wiccan rhetoric.  Here's an example:  "I ask that the Dark Goddess...bless and protect me during this rite.  I ask for wisdom, guidance, and comfort as I deeply mourn my losses.  I release the past and I am free.  This is correct and for the good of all.  May it harm none.  So shall it be."  Non-sectarian, my eye.  I don't really have a problem with the use of ritual, or candle-burning, or any of that.  I don't think this stuff works in any supernatural or magical way--and there is certainly no credible evidence to suggest they do--but the unconscious does seem responsive to the symbols of ritual, and I think a good argument can be made for making healthy, life-affirming rituals a large part of our lives.  But calling on "Crone power"....well, I don't think so.  This book is written by a woman and seems aimed primarily at women, although that might not be obvious on first reading.  I don't think it excludes men, but where gender-specific issues are brought up, they tend to be female issues like rape and menopause and domestic abuse.  That's fine, I guess, if you're a woman, or a Sensitive New Age guy who responds to the nurturing warm fuzzies this book throws around.  I'm not that kind of guy, though, and don't respond to it--that is my own subjective experience, and not a problem with the book, which is free to find any audience it wants. (Readers might object that the crystal-healing nonsense is also free to find its own audience, and in a sense they might be right, but I think it is a completely different thing to pass off crystal-healing mumbo-jumbo as therapy.)  I still think that the symbolism of tarot might be used effectively for shadow work, and that the author's idea was a good one.  Jette is sincere in what she offers, and her writing strong.  She seems to genuinely care about helping people.  
 The first thing I noticed about this book is that on the first page there was a drawing of a bird-headed Egyptian diety, and the masonic symbol.  Since I see free masonry as conflicting with Scriptures, I suspected the book was not the Scripturally based book I'd hope it was when I ordered it.  Within just a few pages the author started giving her belief that there was a pre-Adamic race of subhuman beings and that they were black.  I did not find her Bible verse back up, nor her archaeological back up, for such beliefs to be justifiable.  But if you like believing that because your skin has less pigment in it than others, that you are therefore a superior being, you will probably enjoy this book very  much 
 Yep, like many viewers I watched this when I was too young and was scared for like weeks on end and couldnt get the tall man image out of my head. Well, when this got re-released I just "had" to have it figuring it would bring back memories and really allow me to get into once again. Unfortunately because I am now older and hopefully a little wiser, the film ends up being a rather cheesey horror movie with a mix-mash plot and NO tension or scary moments whatsoever.  Hey, I wasnt looking for a Dustin Hoffman like performance in a horror movie but geeez the acting was pretty rough and forced. The plot started off pretty cool but then began to not know what to do with itself and got almost silly towards the end. The mausoleum itself was eerie but the dwarf guys (Star Wars Jawas?) were pretty funny and the whole thing just didnt add up. As always in horror films a quick call to the police is all it would have taken to stop this Tall man, but no.... lets grab the trusty shotgun and take care of it ourselves...... c'mon.  The scene with the plastic bug in the jacket made me laugh outloud and I rewound it just to get another laugh. The film makers had to know how silly this looked.... didnt they?  I hope that scene was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or the film makers need to rethink their film careers. And of course, the thought process of the characters just didnt make any logical sense. I wont go into details, you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.  Oh yeah, the mustard-covered fingers was also a classic laugh moment.  The silver fyling ball is still cool as hell and that alone earned the movie an extra star rating from me. I do like Jody, he tries to do the right things for the most part and has that waaaay cool 'Cuda that he drives around.  Little Mike was just a young kid and you almost felt bad for him losing so many people he cared for.... it had to be tough.  However, that doesnt excuse the inherent silliness of the movie or the plot that just doesnt unfold correctly or logically.  Maybe I expected too much, maybe I've become an overly-critical movie watcher, but nontheless, I cant recommend this other than for a quick watch.  Rent it, dont buy it since it has really zero redeeming qualities or multiple-viewing value.  This could have been soooooo much better with a the proper direction and a little more time put into the films flow. It was  a great concept for horror. Sci-Fi thrown in with mystical elements as well. Great starting point and it was refershingly different as opposed to the usual "10 kids go camping and get hacked by an ax murderer" [...] that you always see. Again though....it was NOT polished at all and just didnt work well enough.  Sorry If I've burst the proverbial bubble of the movies fans. But, its a "cult" classic for a reason. Much like the Rocky-Horror Picture Show, the event is the real attraction for the fans...the movie itself is horrible and pointless but fans dont want to face that fact so they hide behind the "cult classic" label.  Hey, whatever.... :)  By the way: The DVD quality is only average.  I expected a better transfer but on my plasma based Home theater, it was pretty grainy and not up to par with  what a re-release should be, IMO.  [... 
 Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:  We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.  Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:  This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.  
 Very underwhelming. If you knew *nothing*, this might be a mediocre starting point, but there are so many other great resources on thyroid disease.  You deserve better than this book.  Like is short.   "Thyroid Power" or "Fat, Fuzzy, or Frazzled", Mary Shomon's books and similar books are *crammed* with helpful scientific information.  Also "Mood cure" is a great book worth checking out. 
 If you went to a dictionary and entered "stereotypes in chick-lit", this book would be pictured.    To start with, the main character, who is "supposed" to be so smart, and has a background in Washington politics, gets drunk and takes her shirt off at a work function.  The book lost me after that.       Los Angeles is pictured as a ditzy town where nothing important happens except for movies being made and people having plastic surgery.    The plot is predictable and lacks originality.  If you really want to read a "girl gets great job and it stinks" book, read the Lauren Weisberger ones - The Devil Wears Prada or Everyone Worth Knowing.  They do a much better service to the subgenre.  There is so much good chick-lit out there.  Anything by Sophie Kinsella or Gemma Townley, for example.     
 Clearly not the best from this author. The story starts well but does not fulfill its promises. I had a hard time reading it through the end 
 Nobody questions that Feynman was one of the great physicists of the 20th century.  (In my lifetime perhaps only Gell-Mann was more accomplished in his results of physics).  This review, however, is not about Feynman the physicist, but rather Feynman the author of 3 textbooks, which purportedly try to teach physics.  At this he has categorically failed for a person that initially knows very little physics 
 I respect Jacques Pepin in many ways, but then there are times when I just want to say, "oh come on, you are better than that!" That says a lot, to a man of his career.  Yes, "The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen" outlines a talented and esteemed chef's career, as much as it reminds us how a chef is made and for what he stands. In the culinary world, as is everywhere, some may say "Times are changing fast." To that, others can say, "The more things change, the more they stay the same." Fortunately, I think Mr. Pepin has stayed true to himself and his ideals throughout time. Indeed, some people never had it; and, perhaps... Well, you know how it goes...  I respect Mr. Pepin, mostly for his incredible and time honored chef techniques; however, this book is an incredible burden to read. If I had my choice, I would rather hope to meet Mr. Pepin in person and hope to ask him questions. Or better yet, be HIS apprentice. Why? Because, he strikes me more of a man that could show and tell in the kitchen, better than he could write a book. The kind of man, of the old world, who tells his story and shows his craft, much as his father would tell his own... and so on and so on. Thus, becomes the profound experience of it. Sort of like an oral history, or folk tale.  Yet, this book takes on the typical, old biographical format, which tells the story of a good boy who struggled, made well as a man and then went on to his senior years with notoriety. It reads predictably, from child hood, into adulthood, then into his first real big job(s), and so on and so on. Add charming anecdotes. Its as if you expect a moral at the end of it. It reminds me of the text book formula stuff I read in college, of the old models of personality, psychology, culture and history. As such, this is how you are to PERCEIVE a great man's life and this is how you RECORD a great man's life. Then, when you are done, you stick him up on a shelf for posteriety with all the other great men and great books. And then you study these great dead men and wait for your own grateful death! Of course, little did you know that you are already dead - spiritually.  Fool! Don't get me wrong, because I don't think that's the real Jacques! That's what is so upsetting. Mr. Pepin is not exactly embracing the world of most celebrity chefs. Currently, he is doing "Fast Food My Way" on TV. There, on the show, his meals are over simplistic, especially when you look at his actual career, let alone his other book "Complete Techniques," which I actually do suggest. Before that show, he joined with his daughter Claudine, and that show was probably just as insulting to a true high-end foodie as the aforementioned. Then too, there's the show with Julia Child, which was reminiscent, if at all enjoyable for their seeming camaraderie. Realize, in turn, each of these TV shows has its own book. Yet, Jacques is the guy who prevailed before the food and gourmet revolution began, so why is he so UNDERSTATED?! What is all this about?  I don't know what more there is to say about the chef and the rest of his life. Frankly, I don't really care to judge that; because, after all, I DO think Jacques has lived well and has enjoyed all that he has done and of which he has been a part. I do think he is thankful, more than we can imagine. Perhaps the life lived is beyond words. But, please, to put it in words and write it down as he did, I don't think it digests as well as the food itself. Nor does it match the friendships he made in the kitchen. Name dropping does not do it justice. I'd rather blame the publisher, than blame him.   By the way, the book on audio CD is no easier to digest.  I checked it out at the library, but soon realized it was quicker and easier in actual text. I couldn't believe it. As the audio CD narrator went on and on, I said to myself, "Is this still on chapter one?!" Such is life, perhaps, a never ending story.  At least in person, I could interject. 
 This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read.  Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist.  When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose.  His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another.  All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart.  The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies?  Come on.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
 How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh. 
 Keith Olberman uses what is a good premise to voice his personal vendetas in this book.  Over and over again he rants about the same people.  Some of the book is enlightining and entertaining but you can not get past the repeated abuse he lays on some people.  Some of the people mentioned deserve to be pointed out but over and over again gets tiring. Sometimes you think that you are reading the exact same information several pages later.  Save your money or at least buy a used copy. wheather you agree with him politically or not, this is just a cash grab for Olberma 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 Ok, so it's boring as hell, pointless, with no plot and about characters who are not even remotely interesting. Then how come this film is actually good? Because you feel obliged to think so. Antonioni is a big name, you know.   
 after one use the non stick teflon started to peel off in big pieces   an absolute waste of mone 
 Rather bland and boring; covering overly general neuroscience topics. Many better neuroscience books have been written covering the same material. 
 This book was not entertaining.  I suffered through each page.  I hated the plot and most of the characters.  I will never read another Doss book again 
 Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself 
 The protagonist in Cosmopolis is Eric Packer - a 28 year old billionaire who spends a day crossing a gridlocked Manhattan in his cork lined limo to get a haircut. Eric is one of the 1990s Masters of the Universe - his life is ruthlessly pared down to ensure maximum efficiency, regular meditations ensure an icy calm, he ensures his body is kept in check by having a doctor give him a rectal examination inside his limo and he gets his mistress to pour chilled vodka on his genitals for kicks, he has also taken a reckless punt with his fortune on the fluctuations of the yen. In other words, a raving lunatic.   As other reviewers have noted, Cosmopolis seems icily detatched from any realistic paradigms. The characters are so freeze dried that any sympathy for them is nullified, the action takes place in a hyper-croweded Manhattan filled with a Sufi rapper's funeral, pastry assassins, political protests, a Presidential visit all on the same day. Even pre 9/11 New York didn't have days as insane as this. The dialogue is coldly intelligent, like in White Noise and Underworld, but at least in those novels the ideas espoused were interesting. In Cosmopolis the central themes of capitalist uber power and rampant technology seem dated and the pared down Delillo style seems almost android, as if his characters were computer generated rather than homosapien.  It is funny, several major authors have tried to cover the overdrive atmosphere of New York circa 2000 (Fury - Rushdie, The Diviners - Moody) and all seem to be terrible novels. Perhaps this era doesn't lend itself to good literature, perhaps it is too recent to be made into art, or perhaps this pre 9/11 golden age only existed in the minds of wealthy US based writers 
 Happy Gilmore is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Then I watched Billy Madison and it was about a totally moronic spoilt rich kid. Total opposites sometimes don't atract. 
 If only the person who put together the soundtrack for final release was half as intelligent as the genius charlie kaufman.  The ORIGINAL soundtrack is great especially the track "adaptation" during the closing scene and credits.  But on this CD its only a tedious remix by fatboy? slim? What a joke 
 ...I read a chapter of the book at a bookstore and my opinion is it is good if you want more practice questions to add to other resources you are already using. (I know it is kind of funny the way review question and answers are numbered 
 I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl.  It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective).  Way too long in my opinion 
 Our family has the original LeapPad, and recently purchased a LeapPad Plus Writing.  I must say that there is no comparison between the two products, and the original LeapPad system is by far superior.  My kid love playing LeapPad, however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess!  Once the pages are written on, you can never get them completely clean, and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together.  If we were to do it all over again, we would have purchased a second LeapPad system, and not bothered with the "Plus Writing" 
 Bought this knife set 3 months ago. It was beautiful with unique patterns on the blade and very sharp. But within few days we noticed it rusts very quickly. We left a knife in the sink in the morning after breakfast, by the time we came home for dinner the knife had several rust spots. We had to use Barkeeper's friend to clean all the rust out. We've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the #*@ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms. Once, when someone else was helping clean up, one went into the dishwasher. It didn't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away! Now the knife has jagged edge!!! I guess if I grind down the knife about 1mm I'll have a full edge again but I didn't expect this from top-of-the-line knives. Will not buy this brand of knives anymore 
 I loved this book---before I had kids!!  I do believe it was helpful in some ways, because I agree with her philosophy.  However, in practice, these methods are spotty at best.  Also, it was only after having kids, that I realized how hostile this author is to parents.  Every misbehavior of kids is blamed on the parents' lack of understanding.  Any parent who is reading this book is obviously trying to be as good a parent as they can and to have this author continuously bash parents as being controlling, etc. is extremely demoralizing.  Check this book out of the library, it has some good points--but DONT buy it 
 --and I've used a LOT of grinders. VERY badly designed, and the "custom" thing is a gimmick and a sham: it's a standard rotary grinder. They just added flashing lights and extra buttons, and made it look bulkier. Every day was a misery dealing with this thing: it's designed so that you have no choice but to spill grinds all over the place when you use it 
 #1 thing you need to do to improve sex life: talk to your partner about what you like and what you 'think' you might like (sexually, and in all other aspects of your relationship) - that is the basic premise of any good sexual "instruction" book.  "How" to start discussion is usually the difficult part...and that's really a book from an entirely different section of the library, in my opinion.  Overall, the book was kinda helpful for ideas, illustrations were helpful, but I have yet to find a sex book that deserves 5 stars.  In all fairness, this one is probably one of the least insipid that I've come across.   
 I recently viewed the new chapter concerning 'naturopathic philosophy' [in the 3rd edition, 2005] within this text at the University of Bridgeport's library, as there's a naturopathic school there that I attended.  The chapter discusses the premises of 'the naturopathic.' Do you really want to be treated by a physician who conflates (blends) supernatural, nonscientific, scientifically discarded, idealistic, metaphysical, religious and scientific information -- and presents the whole thing as [supposedly] scientific? [a misrepresentation: Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District anyone?].  Check out "The Epistemic Conflation of a School of Thought Claiming to be Scientific" and "Why I Dropped Out of Naturopathy School" - online per me, Rob Cullen. [THIS is future healthcare? I disagree, these prophets are truly 'facing backward']. I'm highly ethically disturbed by this text and naturopathy, still. I'll just make one point about this book's contention that complexity, self-regulation, and evolution indicate that life defies the laws of natural science {and is therefore supernatural} -- particularly the second law of thermodynamics, per physics, in terms of life as supposedly being antientropic as indicated by life's evolving complexity [p.081-082] -- therefore justifying, particularly, vitalism and its handmaiden teleology-finalism. [Beliefs essential to 'the naturopathic'; explanations no longer within science at all; rejected-knowledge in terms of the scientific].[Yes, evolution! Even though evolution is actually the culmination of 'methodological naturalism,' which is HOW science approaches phenomena, that is: SCIENCE DOES NOT INVOKE THE SUPERNATURAL {which includes ideas like naturopathy's vitalism, spiritism and kind}, science determines its contents based upon EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, and exceptionally LEAN explanatory approaches {per parsimony: as in 'do not multiply entities needlessly'; that is, if not ascribed by the evidence, IT ISN'T A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION}]. Ah, HUGE problem.  The second law deals with closed systems and life's context is within an open system, in terms of thermodynamics. [For the compliance of the 'living' with thermodynamic law, see Atwater & Rosa's work in 1897 which specifically speaks in terms of the first law {the Kinesiology Dept. of Rice University has a nice web page on biological thermodynamics}; and see 'Biological Thermodynamics' ISBN 0521795494 {p.321 specifically speaks in terms of the second law}]. UB says NDs practice "scientific medicine" and naturopathy is "health science."  Hmmm, what kind of [supposed] science text gets something so simple WRONG? Naturopathy is a 'self-labeled science-based' area that won't let go of what has not been considered scientific [the supernatural, the metaphysical, the idealistic, the scientifically-refuted and -discarded -- and kind; i.e., the tenets of their doctrines] for several decades PLUS.  This text reflects naturopathic 'epistemic mislabeling nonsense' [e.g. naturopathy's vitalism ("life force"), spiritism ("personal spiritual development; body, mind, spirit"), teleology-finalism ("intelligent, purposeful") and 'whatever else idealism' AREN'T science-based (or even empirical phenomena, as in therefore 'not scienceable')]. In reality, minimally, a mandatory, manipulatable, spiritual, 'underlying' {metaphysical, supernatural, idealistic and what-not} 'life force' {of many aliases} immediately responsible for states of health and disease is INSTEAD AN ARTICLE OF FAITH {aka 'sectarian medicine'}].  Hmmm: "the most thoroughly researched and carefully referenced text on natural medicine has been revised to include the most up-to-date information...." It has been a couple of months since I read that chapter, and I'm still, honestly, LAUGHING OUT LOUD. Naturopathy is, essentially, a 'supernatural science' (an oxymoron; particularly, vital-force-spirit, spiritism, and teleology-finalism as "science-based" are arrived at through a radical unlimiting of the boundaries of 'the scientific'); while evidence from science doesn't support the supernatural, the metaphysical, or the idealistic; and vitalism and spiritism, in terms of physiological agency, are refuted biological hypotheses.  -rc.  
 This text will be a chore to read for most American students who are new to GIS.  Although the author(s) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters, the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy, jargon-filled 'proper' use of British English & spellings.  If you decide to purchase this book, then I highly recommend the 'Oxford Unabridged English Dictionary' to go along with it.  The majority of the students in my class "Geographic Information Systems I" at Southwest Texas State University, which has one of the best geography programs in the nation, felt the same way I do, and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory GIS class.  I think that the professors at Southwest Texas State University are now using a different text for that class.  Also, people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- Well, like it or not, in the United States, ESRI has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn ArcView/Info one way or another 
 Somewhat disappointing as I was looking for a deeper explanation of the fundamental relations, as the book's name implies. Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan are both internal martial arts and I would have thought that the philosophies, techniques & applications would have been described in more detail than maybe the two sentences mentioned in the entire book. A great deal is discussed about the history of the Chinese Martial Arts and its influences into the Japanese martial arts, which is fine and perhaps from which the fundamental relations are drawn from. In this case, the book should have been titled - ..."The Historical Relations." Keep looking elsewhere if you are searching the true fundamental relations. 
 reads like it was written by an elementary schooler during recess and stereotypes every culture/character it tries to relate to the reader.  insulting to the intelligence of its audience. possibly the most laughable piece of garbage ever put into hard cover.  
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 The large size and multiple settings were great.  But product stopped working after just a couple of months 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 We got this and still use it, but speed "2" no longer works.  This was less than a year before the button broke.  It worked nicely when this, the faster speed, was working.  Now we still use it but it is not as effective 
 This doesn't even deserve the star I gave it. Think about how ridiculous this is! It was written by a self-proclaimed vampire, and describes magic spells and other bs used for other aspiring vampires to replace blood-sucking with energy...um...sucking. Don't believe this bs for a second. If you are sincerely interested in the wackjob vampire subculture, get a book on its history. If you personally believe yourself to be a vampire, go for psychiatric help. You probably have dissociated personality disorder. 
 This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with "Substance" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on 
 Oh my friends, I tried Atlas-fashion but to no avail. This drawn out excercise in long haired erudition was simply too much for me. I'm sorry but there were cracks on the cieling that needed observing, weekends to be spent at the market and hangnails to chew. No, Ontogeny and phylogeny was simply not to be. I tried mind you, I read it up to page 223 where Gould set out to delineate De Beer's eight categories of heterochrony in part II, chapter 7 of this opus, where upon I cried "enough!!" I really like Gould too. I loved "Wonderful Life" and devoured "Ever Since Darwin." Indeed, Gould waxed eloquently (and succintly) on neoteny, paedomorphism and heterochrony in "Ever Since Darwin." Ontogeny and Phylogeny on the other hand will make you wish you'd never heard of these terms. I will say, having read part I, that I did get a thorough grounding in why Haeckel's recapitulation is untenable, but I was able to get that in one paragraph in Werner Muller's "Developmental Biology." Maybe this book was just a bad personality fit for me, and lord knows I love biology better than money or food, but I found it to be a not pleasant to read, sparingly informative, massive waste of time. This may seem harsh to Gould-ophiles, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise. On a positive note, it did give a good historical account of such 19th century natural science luminaries like Haeckel, Von Baer, de Beer, et al, and the development of their thought. Maybe if I were incarcerated I'd read this book, as it is there are too many other interesting and rewarding activities to pursue 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 If you purchase a Garmin product, especially this one, you are firmly in the clutches of a Company that gives you what they want you to have, not what you might want. Everything Garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a Garmin. You will be unable to transfer data to Garmin media, you will be insulted by a website either written by or for aliens and should you call the customer service or cartography lines assuming you wish to wait and wait, you will get to talk to people so uninformed about Garmin products your wait was wasted. The dingus works ok with Garmin chips, but the chips are inadequate or incomplete. If you should have a Mac, Garmin leaves you totally unsupported so that if you choose a Garmin you need to buy a PC, a downloader, and Garmin chips to go with Garmin's vastly overpriced CDs. In short, if you prefer unsupported products that are designed to force you to buy from a company indifferent to their customers, Garmin should be at the top of your list with their GPSMAP 276c 
 It's great to be reminded about all these early sentimental novels, but that's about it. So maybe the best thing about Stern's book is the bibliography. It sure isn't the prose or the insights. I was SO disappointed by this book 
 Paris has finally done it! She's ruined the definiton of music! TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL! According to her, she's blind... if you can even consider her a star... but in a recent interveiw she said that she cries everytime she hears her album *cough concided brat cough* SHE MUST BE DEAF!! All her lyrics are pathetic... and can u think of anyone more concided? her purpose in life is for all of us to laugh at how much she loves herself and make fun of her being stupid. Paris, if you're reading this... i'm sorry hun, u just can't sing. just because you think you're great and daddy's a rich man... that doesn't make everyone think your sexy or hot... and it CERTAINLY doesn't mean you can sing. the only thing her music is good for is to laugh at because it is so incredibly stupid. who's fighting over her and who thinks she's sexy? anyone who does can join her in the mental/blind/deaf ward at her hospital. o i take that back, she probably has her own personal hospital with gold doors and big stereos so she can listen to herself and think about how wonderful she is... SPARE US! sorry to cut this off  but i think i'm gonna barf 
 As a powered hub this works well. I can't speak to its cooling power because I couldn't get my 17" laptop to sit on it and not move. There are only two rubber feet on the top surface, at the back, so a large laptop will not rest securely on it and will slide all over at the front. After trying another cooler that was too small for a large notebook, I bought this one specifically because it said it worked with 17" laptops. Not mine 
 I had to wonder if it was possible to write a good 400 page book based around "Friday the 13th".  The answere is no.  "Hell Lake" is certainly an interesting idea; Jason is in Hell, and he meets a life long fan, recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez.  The two lead a rebellion out of Hell, taking with them the worst of humanity's rejects with them.  And then they happen to crash a Friday the 13th bash being held on Crystal Lake.  The hundreds of killers on murder two of the college age partiers before departing to the four corners of the Earth.  Jason sticks around Crystal Lake, but moves on to a near by college campus.  Meanwhile, Sanchez makes his way back to Florida, where he was arrested to begin with.  To go on seems a bit pointless.  I loved the "Friday the 13th" movies, and so was bitterly disappointed with this novel.  It just went absolutly nowhere.  The 'heros' (and I use that term loosly) are beyond unappealing; I didn't even want Jason to go after them, they were such a waste of time.  The only one that was half way decent was the Paul Christos character, only because he had such a warped fascination with the sociopaths, and his 'dangerous philosophy' was a decent concept.  But nothing was done with it and he is a horrible little creep that gets what he deserves too late in the book.  And Jason, we are not given any insight into him, except that he just hates humans, and sex drives him nuts.  But we already knew that.  Half way through he trades his hocky mask in for a welders helmet.  What is going on?  I am reading the first book in the series right now, and it seems a lot better so far.  Just skip this one please.  It is boring, violence is alright, but repetitive after awhile, and the characters are pathetic 
 Jerome Charyn is a good writer and also a table tennis lover.  He writes about the sport with many colorful analogies and clever expressions, sometimes using French without translating it.  For me, it got a bit tiring, but it could be enjoyable if you like his creative writing style.   Much of the book is rehashing of the stuff in Marty Reisman's "The Money Player" and Tim Boggan's books.  But Jerome also interviewed many people for the book and adds new perspectives to some well known figures in the sport from these interviews.  I noticed an occasional mistake in the book, but not many.  It is mostly well researched 
 I was looking for genuine, practical insights into pilgrimage. Rather than spirituality, I found unchecked sentimentality; rather than insights, I found endless cliches. There were a few interesting anecdotes, but on the whole the book is merely cleverness and pretentious references to elite culture. The book won't help anyone who wants to make a pilgrimage; it helps people who want to feel warm and fuzzy about pilgrimage. Cousineau throws around (and manipulates) religious traditions like a child plays with her mother's jewelry: without any notion of their true value. In short, the book is superficial and sentimental. Unless this appeals to you, spend your money on something else 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 This book is a cure for insomnia.  If I ever have trouble falling to sleep, I'll just dig out my old "Flatland" book, and I'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later!  Listening to the A. Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing!  Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing.  I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying.  I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story.  Not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 I purchased this book based on the reviews posted. However, it didn't live up to my expectations. What little advice he actually gives is basic common sense. He says this is what every woman needs to know about catching a man. Well, if you're in need of this very basic instruction, finding a man should not be your first priority. Also, he has padded the book heavily with quotes. I guess this is an attempt to compensate for the lack of original material. If you eliminated all of the quotes and references to other works, you'd be left with little more than a pamplet. If you are a single woman, and you are serious about finding a nice guy remember patience is a virtue. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you're in the market for a book of relationship quotes. This book gets one star only because of the clever fishing metaphor used 
 I was expected more model of the book but the whole book only teached one model 
 I read this book a while ago (I was a self employed exec recruiter for fifteen years) and it still stands out as one of the silliest. The amount of information either a Manager or another headhunter will glean from this material is negligible. The pages discussing her "schedule" in which she shows us all how hard she works are so laughably self-important that you should skim them in the bookstore for humor's sake. 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 I have never written a review before but was so disappointed with this book I felt compelled to this time. Don't be fooled by the attractive artwork, this story is incomprehensible to kids and adults.If you are looking for a bedtime book, pick something else or be prepared for questions about naked children being baked in ovens.  
 I live on the Vineyard and let's just say, this cook book does not represent island living in the least. The island is filled with an eclectic mix of people but you would never know it by this book. It tries a little too hard, says very little, is not innovative and seems to feel that it is better than the rest of us by showing some pictures and recipes of some celebrities and those who like to hang out with them. I have tried many of the recipes and few are memorable. The chatter written by the authors of the book and of each individual recipe seems overwritten and trite. Give me some humor, some grit, some wit. These are some pretty self-absorbed people. Lighten up, people. Let's hope this is the LAST of this series... 
 I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time. ___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________  This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things. Not Ideal what so ever for skiing. I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing 
 Unless you're writing a DOS app, this book is pretty much useless.  My synopsis on the whole parallel I/O is that if you're using NT 4 or newer, go the CreateFile route.  If it's Win 98 or older, give up 
 A couple of points.  I dug this book out again because I needed some inspiration on what to do with a $17 pork loin roast. Score! In the 'marinades' chapter, there are 13 pork marinade recipes. But. There are eight marinades for barbecued spareribs. And four for roast chicken. AND THAT'S IT. There are no marinades for seafood, none for vegetables, and none for just 'beef'. There is one brief paragraph on p. 704 (five lines!) about the 'large and important part' that marinades play in Chinese cooking, but no comment on whether the marinade recipes she gives might be successfully interchanged, or how they might be modified for vegetables, other meats or tofu. A little more information here would have been tremendously helpful, given how 'important' the author purports marinades to be.  The thing that really motivated me to post this little review-let, though, is the fact that the author or her editors did something pretty sloppy. She lists an ingredient with no discussion of what it is! In the recipe for 'Sugar-Soy Marinade', which is on p. 717 of the 1984 Fireside Edition, she notes at the end of the recipe: "variation: add 2 tablespoons of catsup ..."   In the Asian cuisines 'catsup' means something different everywhere one goes. So I check the index for 'catsup'. Nothing. Then I check the ingredient glossary. Nothing. I look under 'Sauces'. Nothing.   So. In 1966, when the book first came out, were cooks reaching for the bottle of Heinz? In 2005, is the 16-year-old wanting to impress his or her friends reaching for the bottle of Heinz? Is that ok in this context? The author never mentions it one way or the other. The author also invokes 'chili sauce' in some of her recipes, without emphasizing the distinction between the Chinese varieties and the American variety. Chili sauce is explained in the ingredient glossary, and is listed in the index. But if the cook doesn't ask the question, he or she really could reach for the tomato product in the pantry. This book was intended to be an introductory text for a 1966 American audience (x). It falls short of this goal for *any* audience.  I will be exploring this book further so that I might benefit from its merits (it cost me twenty bucks!). It certainly helped me out with the pork roast. However, I *cannot* recommend it to the complete beginner *as a purchase*, even in today's world where Asian cuisine is so much more familiar than it was in 1966. And if you need a recipe for a pork marinade, go ahead and check the book out of the library 
 I found this memoir to be dull, dull, dull.  This is sad, as I purchased this book on CD to keep my daily commute interesting.  It almost put me to sleep -- I nearly rolled the car!  Rather typical "coming-of-age" story where the person in question feels misunderstood, takes a lot of drugs, and has sex only to discover that she is somehow different than the rest of her friends.   Throw in some dysfunctional parents and fellow 'misfit' friends and viola!  Your typical formulaic memoir.  The pace of the book rambles and plods on and on, jumping from one topic to the next.  It is hard to follow and determine exactly what she is talking about and/or rebelling from, but it seems to be life in general.  Buy this book only if you need help falling asleep 
 I've tried four recipes so far and only one turned out good.  I'm an experienced baker and have never had this many flops from one book.  Polka dot Minicakes came out awful, the glaze was way too sweet and would not spread as pictured.  The Sweet cheese puffs were just so-so. The Dutch Chocolate Minicakes were excellent.  The Lemon-laced gingersnaps were passable, not great; I have a much better recipe. I also was disappointed in the lack of photos.  I'm now not eager to try any other recipes from this book.  Sometimes I think authors leave out something so you won't get their secrets? 
 poor quality photo's. Very tame. A guy I know who ran away from two 'forward' girls on a train once may buy this. Shame, could have been a cracker. 
 This biography is particularly deceiving as Mr. Barnes packages it wrapped in historical information, but then includes misinformation and gossip  presenting it all as facts 
 She is DISGUSTING!!! The only good thing about her is that to scare people away simply show them this doll and they'll go screaming! My friend, Lucy Banette, has this doll. The hair tangles, the clothes rip, and even she admits it SUCKS!!! Her white skin makes her look like a vampire ghost. Not one for decoration!!! Not even for a 'playing-with' doll. Too fragile and disgustingly sickening to look at! What are we trying to teach children here??? That it is good to dress like you have just died? Have you ever seen a goth look like this? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So please, MGA, carry on with lil' Bratz. THEY RULE!!! But NOT your silly gothy, punky Bratz. I have two lil' bratz. They are in the collection 'life style'. I have Sasha and Cloe. I don't know why you called Cloe Ailani and Sasha Zada. They are STUPID names! I HAD to redo their names! It feels nice to express myself! Bye, to goth haters! GO AWAY, you silly fans of this Bratty goth doll 
 No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death.  This film gave me a headache.  The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly.  At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were.  I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago.  Do check out the "Gerald McBoing-Boing" cartoon thats included on the disc.  It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than "Dr. T" does in ninety minutes 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 Half of this book is just Tom reading events from a high school history book. I expected the book to contain 90% letters but was disappointed half of the book contained this unwanted history review. It seems Tom is just trying to capitalize on the generation's tragedy. His reading of the factual events adds almost nothing to the understanding of the letters 
 Other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book, so I'll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals:  the characters (and I do mean all of them) are pathetic: thieves and murderers; the setting is a dark, pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life; and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well.  Although Gibson is intelligent and quite creative, he seems to enjoy creating difficult, jargony prose (muddying the waters so that they appear deep?).  If this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre, then the genre is not for me 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 The only good thing about this movie is my all-time favorite  singer, Justin Hayward from the Moody Blues, sings "Something  Evil, Something Dangerous" during the opening credits.  That's   all 
  "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD?  Give me a break!  As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack.  I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) "All I want for Christmas is You."  Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie.  In the movie she sings her intro without background music.  On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.  When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?  Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation?  J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon 
 I was given this book as a birthday present from someone who knew I liked writers like Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Gardner.  Having never read any of the previous 'Scarpetta' novels, I will confess that I was somewhat in the dark about the history of the characters.  Unfortunately, I could find no characters that I cared about or were the least bit interested in.  I was also given another 'Scarpetta' novel to read, but I think I am going to pass.  BLOW FLY was absolutely unreadable.  One of the worst reading projects I have ever attempted.  
 This is living proof that crap needs a million dollar budget. This movie was bland. It had no style, no original elements, and overall, nothing good about it. Well, I take that back, the main character's husband had the best mullet. But other than that, nada. Unlike the original Howling, which had awesome and unique looking werewolves, this one the werewolves are, well, wolves. No make up required. They turned into the average, everyday wolf. Didn't put a whole lot a work into that did they? This movie was a B-movie, but didn't have a lot of the GOOD B-movie elements. What I learned from Howling 4: Howling 3 is way better as a B-movie. If you liked this movie, I recomend: Banging your head against a brick wall, because for as much pain as your going to go through watching this movie, you might as well inflict it on yourself 
 I found this movie to be almost unwatchable.  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you.  The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it.  Altman can pull off such greats as "Mash" and  "Godsford Park" and then stink up the joint with this.  What's up with that 
 One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.   The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the "flip it" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the "dirty water" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer.   On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day 
 While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past. Instead, I was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. Another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing. I felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read. I am age 48, college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers. I would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice, nor do I think it appropriate for a magazine such as Redbook.  Parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes. IT HAS CHANGED 
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 Please stop letting yourself be brainwashed by this macho hypocricy.  A large part of  street punk and oi! is just something for racist, scared white people to hide behind. Singing about wearing boots and beating up people who you outnumber does not make you special, it just makes you as hateful and narrow-minded as the authorities you oppose.  If you really want to be tough, save the whales. This band is government music, and big time labels prefer these hateful bands because they make punks look like a bunch of scary degenerates, and because they can convince some teenagers to fight in the middle east.  Think about what you're doing if you choose to buy this cd; do you really think that in 30 years you will say "I am happy I became such a moron and beat up all my neighbors."   
 I had great expectations of this book but the more I read the worse it got. For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of 
 Other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book, so I'll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals:  the characters (and I do mean all of them) are pathetic: thieves and murderers; the setting is a dark, pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life; and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well.  Although Gibson is intelligent and quite creative, he seems to enjoy creating difficult, jargony prose (muddying the waters so that they appear deep?).  If this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre, then the genre is not for me 
 I don't normally write these reviews, but I feel a responsibility to other readers to warn them away from this book.  If you don't want to know any details about the book, you have the option of not reading this review, but, if you want to know what you're letting yourself in for, read on.  If you are a horse lover, I srongly advise against reading The Horse Whisperer.  If you want a romantic love story, you should also look elsewhere.  If you want insight into dealing with a trauma, so sorry, no luck here.  The book opens with a graphic description of a violent accident involving a girl and her horse, which results in death.  Though I found these scenes truly disturbing, I hoped the trip taken by the girl and her mother to find an expert who could help to heal the girl and her horse would prove redeeming somehow.  Instead, the experience was muddled and pointless.  The few instances involving the "whisperer" attempting to heal the horse from its trauma struck me as something that would further traumatize the poor animal.  Nothing he does ever seems to break through and cause the horse any improvement.  Additionally, the mother appears to have no purpose in the story except wandering aimlessly around the farm, occasionally cheating on her husband with this man, and becoming pregnant with his child.  The book's focus then turns almost completely to this ill-advised affair which doesn't really have any chemistry to it.  The man and the mother don't seem that attracted to each other, and evidently only end up together because the plot required it of them.  During all this, the girl's psychological problems resulting from the accident are basically ignored.  She pretty much drops out of sight until the very close of the book when she is taken by the horse whisperer to witness another graphically brutal occurrence, which ends in another horrific death.  Apparently, what we are to glean from this book is that, if you are a woman who can't have children with your husband, getting knocked up by another man will save your marriage.  If you are a young girl who happens to witness a violent death, nothing will cure you except witnessing another violent death.  If you're a horse, you can just figure things out for yourself.  The fact that everyone seems blissfully happy after all this absurdity, just feels as though the author got bored with what he was writing and figured he had to wrap it up with a Hollywood ending somehow so he could get it off to the publisher quickly.  In the end, I see no reason to waste your time with this book.  I wish I could get back the hours of my life I spent on it.      
 Having never read this author before, I did not know she was a macrobiotics enthusiast.  I just wanted some general information on improving my diet.  I'm not interested in macrobiotics.  However, in perusing the book, it seemed to be very detailed and comprehensive.  It also seemed to be very labor intensive.  If you're into macrobiotics, I guess it's a labor of love.  It just wasn't for me 
 I was very disappointed in this translation. Bringing the language into  modern form distorted the meanings and lost the beauty and simplicity of  the original. I recommend Gitanjali if you want to experience real Tagore 
 ... that brought the this book WAY down for me right from the start. Other books I have enjoyed with a psychic character/element (a la Linda Howard  and Jayne Ann Krentz ) made them seem plausible and not part of the fortune reading scam artist low life crowd that has always turned me off. Trying to legitimize tarot cards and Psychic Phone hotlines in any way just ruined the book for me.  I liked Last Girl Dancing by the same author, but truly felt the tarot reading heroine premise destroyed this one before it ever got going.  I just don't want to continue reading as I don't trust it to get good enough (after it stumbled BIG with the first romantic scene that simply came off awkward and made me laugh at the stupid dialog) to overcome the implausible, so obviously bogus side to paranormal con artists that feeds on the lonely, depressed and naive for money. I have seen otherwise intelligent people, especially women, fork over hundreds of dollars to these low life's of the paranormal, so I admit the topic was already a major turn-off for me.    The book just wasn't good enough to overcome my distaste for the subject of tarot card reading cons.  
 This is a common text for many introductory anthropology courses.   It's apparently a classic ethnographic work, but honestly one of the most boring books I think I have ever read 
 It was actually not the cd I wanted But I do like a few songs on it. 
 Whole book rings false. Like dining at the Olive Garden and hearing cheesy Dean Martin songs played out of the speakers. Or going to lunch at a Japanese restaurant where the diners are tourists and the only Japanese people there are the ones that come just to see where the tourists eat. Dialogue seems one sided like she's talking with herself even though it's supposed to be with other people. Plot seems, for lack of a better word, pretty whack 
 This was too much Spence for me. Having met an investigator who worked for  Spence and saw the man behind the fringe, I must say that his public  persona and actual self seem to differ substantially. After learning some  of the information that will never be written -- at least not by Spence --  I lost much of my desire to read his crafted memoir 
 This is terrible!  This book lacks even the most rudimentary Alexander scholarship and accepts many of the stories of the Alexander Romance without question.  The lessons extracted may be fine but many do not truly come from Alexander the Great. I guess the basic assumption here is that nobody knowing anything about Alexander in depth will even read this volume.  This is another in a recent rash of noncritical Alexander worshipping books.  Please read some of the great books and literature on Alexander the Great to get a balanced picture 
 Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the "menu" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned "off." The only way to avoid this is to choose "other" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 The case is a CHEAPLY made box of wood that did not even survive shipping.  The materials contained inside are poor quality.  The rating does not deserve one star.  I returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping, but it would have been returned regardless because it is GARBAGE! 
 "The End of Science" is a stupid book written by a stupid science fanboy journalist with a big case of envy for Francis Fukuyama's "The End of History and the Last Man." "The End of Science" is what happens when journalists spend so much time hanging out and fawning over scentists that they start believing they're scientists themselves 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 Perhaps I had been expecting a true sequeal to the original. I was so excited when I saw the book but instead of a taut, touching tale I got a rambling, frequently boring, difficult to follow story that I had to force myself to finish.  It seemed more a tale of politics and religious infighting than a science fiction story.  Problems?  How about WAY too many characters, many with multiple names. I consider myself intelligent and widely read but the rush of people created such a flux that the plot seemed almost secondary.  I liked the hero but for all his potential he did little more than whine, worry and wonder.  His boss, the antipope, became the star of the show along with the swordsman.    The story did not "flow" and bogged down several times in minor details.  The first section covereding the time in the abbey passed uneventfully but for a few personal crises. Then we journey toward the conclave and are introduced to host of new folks.  Finally we arrive in the city and meet yet another cast of characters.  The story was as much about Native American culture as anything.  The language issues, interesting at first, became tiresome as we switched from various dialects (some almost unpronouncable with special symbols) to Latin (frequently) to English.  All in all, not a success 
 CRAP.  That's all I can say for this annoying movie, Amanda Bynes is a pain in the a** once again.    If I had a wider range of ratings, then I would give it -20 stars out of 5 
 My four-year-old daughter was subjected to this travesty of a children's book in preschool.  Ever since, she has awakened nightly at 3 a.m., tears streaming down her face, worried about burglars coming through her window.  I'm not "squeamish" or a "namby-pamby" as suggested by other condescending reviewers of this book.  But I do value my sleep.  If you value yours, pass this one up.  There are many other good children's books out there 
 This book is not an objective,in depth look at how the neocons are harming the republican party. This book is the authors personal memoir and not a very good one at that. He does discuss politics among other things but leaves out any detailed analysis. It mainly consists of the author describing various events of his life with a few clumsy attempts at humor. 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 I really want to like this book.  The explainations are good. The projects are nice and game oriented so they keep your attention.  However, the book has a large number of mistakes in the text.  Especially in the code you need to follow.  Also, the author totally misses on showing off Object Oriented Programing.  He gives a decent showing of what OOP is, but the project that comes in that chapter lacks the creation of any Classes.  I was really liking the explaination of OOP, but you get nearly no experience of it from the project.  This book had a lot of potential, but misses 
 This is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips! How could you make ice cream taste so rotten? Bat barf I say!! Even if it was good, it is much too great of a hassle! It took my Dad over 2 hours to put together, and what did we get?! A tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top! I got this hunk of junk 2 years ago, Christmas. It has gathered dust on my shelf ever since!      
 Anybody buying this book to learn some BW will be very much disappointed. Like the way the book is organised but older stuff. I can't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book. Not only they should stop selling, also should recall the book 
 Don Caballero have always had members leave, but this is ridiculous.  Che is not Don Cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band.  Ian Williams for one is a huge reason for the Don Caballero sound that I always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete.  Why Che decided on naming this new group under the Don Caballero name rather than Speaking Canaries or something else baffles me.  More importantly, the music is BORING on this album.  It's like the new members only influences were Yes and ELP sans vocals.  In other words, no spontaneity, hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines.  Avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the Battles EPs or better yet get the real Don Cab works like Singles Breaking Up or What Burns.  There is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this "new" Don Caballero to pieces 
 We were one of the first to purchase this powerful little battery operated train.  At first my two year old loved it and I was surprised how many trains it could pull behind it.  The honeymoon soon ended, however, when two days later it needed a new battery.  Eight batteries and fifteen days later, the train stopped working (except for the little light on the front) and my son was very sad.  Great idea, but bad product.  We also purchased the larger battery operated red locomotive train which still works great 
 If you're considering buying this book...save your money.  This book is the same as the online study guide on the Border Patrol's website.  It has the same questions and the same alternative language.  It does have a couple full-length practice tests.  I was hoping for some insight into the actual test or some "inside" information that may not be outlined on the Border Patrol's website or in its' study guide.  I was VERY disappointed with this purchase 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 WARNING: Onions are toxic to cats, and these recipes are full of onions.  While a few recipes in this book may be safe, it's hard to trust that because many recipes specifically for cats contain onion -- and ABBEY, whose review 32 people found helpful, is dead wrong that this is only the "people recipes at the end of the book." (Sorry, ABBEY, but I did read and comprehend the information.)   Don't be swayed by my saying so -- please judge for yourself. With the pet food recall, we all need to watch out for each other and, more importantly, for our precious cats. Below, I have copied page 23 verbatim, and it is NOT one of the "people recipes" at the end of the book:  "Tuna Cakes Cats will race even faster to the sound of a whirring can opener if they think you're about to prepare this tasty and nutritious dish. 2 eggs 1 6-ounce can tuna, drained, and flaked 1 small ONION, finely chopped 4 slices bread, cubed into kitty size bits 1/2 teaspoon iodized salt 1 teaspoon brewer's yeast 1 teaspoon bonemeal 2 tablespoons margarine  1. Beat the eggs lightly in a bowl. Add the tuna, ONION, bread cubes, salt, brewer's yeast, and bonemeal. Mix thoroughly until moistened. 2. Form into small patties. Melt the margarine in a skillet and fry the patties until golden brown. When cool, crumble each patty and serve. Makes 3 to 5 servings."  On page 25, the Fish Chowder specifically for cats calls for 1 glove garlic, minced and 2 tablespoons finely chopped ONION. On page 27, the Boogaloo Shrimp, again, in a recipe supposedly specifically for cats, the first ingredient is 1/2 chopped ONION. Page 32, the recipe for Chicken with Greens, there is a warning about introducing cats gradually to greens because they can be sensitive to it, but no warning about the 1 clove garlic in the recipe or on page 33, the Chicken Salad that calls for 1 tablespoon finely chopped ONION. The "people" recipes ABBEY refers to, called "Tandem Cooking" by the author, do not begin until page 81.  I am extremely disappointed I bought this potentially dangerous book and applaud the reviewer Cordelia Wright who is researching the vet who wrote the preface.  This is not a time to stand on ceremony when pet health is at stake from commercial food -- we need reliable sources of information about safe food, and this book is not it for the reasons previous reviewers have stated. Buyer, please beware.  I have complained to Amazon about continuing to promote and sell this book in the face of the pet food scare (a sick irony that people avoiding tainted commercial food turn to a so-called "vet-approved" recipe book containing recipes that will harm their cats!), and I have written a complaint to the book's publisher. I'm also pursuing getting a journalist involved to warn the public and find out how this book's author can claim these recipes are "vet-approved" when no vet would say giving onions to cats is safe 
 I agree with rigg_vienna. This film is one of the worst of all Agatha Christie movies. The version of 1981 with Sir Peter Ustinov is MUCH better, and not to forget such great actors like Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith or James Mason. If you want "Evil under the sun", forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 Vijay Prashad presents the fringe (CPM, bordering on Trotskyite) view of the world. This book is heavy on rhetoric and light on facts. It begins with some interesting ideas but fails completely to deliver a cogent argument 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 Catherine of Siena would recieve revelations from God and enter ecstatic trances.  In those transes she would have "dialogues" with God which her sisters recorded, thus the title. Catherine was used by the Pope to be peacemaker between warring cities and as such she was a Papal apologist, meeting with nobles and dignitaries throughout Europe, a different role for a woman of that time. As mystic she would dialogue with God about the church, the pope, priests and recieve counsel that are recorded in the "Dialogues".  The prose is instructional, not exhortive in nature.  It is not a book that one reads expecting to come away uplifted and enthused, rather you will recieve sound direction 
 This little book is really a "coffee table" book for those who enjoy these kinds of compilations, but don't expect much from this one.   Each page has a very short line about "why a daughter needs a mom..." i.e., "to read to her," "who can play on her level," "to listen closely to what troubles her," etc. etc.     I found nothing overly moving or memorable here, in fact, the black and white photographs accompanying each of the 100 Reasons do nothing to bring these pages to life.  Most photos are clearly contrived portraits of "everyday-type" models posing to reflect the sentiment on the page.   None of them look spontaneously photographed to capture a feeling or a moment.  I'm assuming that the author, Gregory E. Lang, aimed at tearing at the heartstrings, but I'm not so sure it was accomplished here in that you'll find very little originality and even less to keep you turning the pages to read more.  By the time I got to Reason #100 (...because without her she will have less in her life than she deserves) we are pretty much bored and will think twice before giving this book as a gift.    I'm both a mom AND a daughter, and I normally love these kinds of books, dedicated to capturing the feelings and sentiments behind family bonds, but this one just doesn't hit the mark.  Save your $ 
 If you read this book, you must read  All Souls : A Family Story from Southie  by Michael Patrick MacDonald. It gives a necessary perspective on  a community rarely described with accuracy. It brings greater truth to the  troubled times in Boston than the Lukas book 
 I LOVE TO DANCE .........SO I WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS!! WHAT A BORING DVD!! DID NOT SWEAT!! HATED HER COMPLICATED MOVES!!!!!

 I was surprised that I got the book was kind of old and not a hardcover as I saw online.  
 The reason all the other readers liked this book is because its preaching to the converted, they read a story they want to hear, dressed as a scientific interpretation of current research. Readers must realize that  Flannery is a paleontologist not an ecologist. In the Future Eaters, he  really only presents his conceptual model of the history of Australia and  is highly selective in his use of the scienfitic interpretation of the  literature, only including those which support his ideas. This is not how  science is done. On the extinction of the megafauna he ignores crticisms  that there isn't the fossil record to support some mass extinction. On the  post european exinction of Australia's mammals ignores all the existing  information supporting 3 alternaive hypothesis in favour of his pet idea on  the role of fire despite a lack of data on fire histories and an  experimental refutation of the notion. Given that I know he has been  extremely biased in his reading of this literature, I have serious doubts  about how selective he has been with other issues with which I am less  familiar, just so he can put together the same old story that humans are  bad, "nature" is good. We need to move forward in managing  damaged landscapes, beyond this self depravation, and make unbiased  scientific management decisions. This storybook on the Ecology of  Australian systems is just a distraction from that objectiv

But Miles Davis ?? i just cant found any element that will makes me like him. kind of blue is not bad , but i just dont think its classic. 
 I find it rather humorous that Mr. Bossidy would write a book with this title.    It was Mr. Bossidy's decision to hire Ray Gimlartin as Chairman of Merck, a decision which most analysts seriously questioned.  The disastrous outcomes of that decision are still being played out.    It took years for Mr. Bossidy to confront reality and do the right thing by finally acknowledging his mistake and replacing Gilmartin.  Even then, as the company was sinking fast, he kept Gilmartin in an advisory capacity with a salary most people can only dream of.  Now he intends to share with others his wisdom regarding "confronting reality"???  If anything, Mr. Bossidy's latest work is a classic case of "do as I say, not as I do" 
 Thinking that I had found an in-depth look at the misconceptions of Westerners about Asia, I purchased Asian Mystique.  At first I was impressed by the work the author had put into researching the asian image in movies, tv and other media, and how that has shaped many westerners view of the "exotic orient".   Unfortunatly, the next two portions about relationships and impressions of asian women by western men turned into a story that would be better off in a magazine than in a book that tries to be academic.  Aside from some nifty census statistics, her "data" consisted of a handful of women she had interviewed who had already in someway identified themselves with the opinion the author was trying to express - hardly scientific. Aside from a brief throw-away statement that there are healthy relationships between western men and asian women, the details are entirely focused on explaining fetishism and how western men try to dominate their asian girlfriends/spouses.  Her conclusions about her experiences with the Japanese housewives were terribly unbalanced as well.  After highlighting one relationship between a westerner and a Japanese woman because it ended in a horrible divorce, she goes on to these other women who are all happy they stayed with Japanese husbands.  It all but actively encourages that people are better off marrying within their own race. Furthermore, I personally know Japanese women who would turn their nose up at the rosy picture she paints of the Japanese societal expectation that women giving up their careers to raise children (based on the small group she interacted with). And finally, halfway through the book I've found no real acknowledgement that the stereotypes and mistaken images are a two way street.  I lived in Japan for three years, and according to a lot of Japanese, Americans all own guns, have been mugged at least once and will jump into bed and have sex after the first date (I guess Hollywood images work everywhere in the world, ne?) All in all, I'm interested in the subject the author has tackled in the book.  I am a firm believer in working through stereotypes and am dismayed when people ask me things like "do japanese still bind their feet?".  Unfortunately, this book falls short of being a real academic work, and seriously lacks a depth needed to break stereotypes and cultural borders.  
 I can't believe this guy got published.  He shows marginal photos of his own apartment and of a remodel of his parents house ... come on!  If it were not so funny to read how seriously he takes himself it wouldn't be worth a star at all.  His environmental ideas are well intended I'm sure but rife with contradictions.  This is like a Saturday Night Live spoof ... including the photo of himself and his lifelong best friend sipping evian out of plastic bottles.  To bad they killed all of those trees to publish this one.  It's a clunker - don't waste your mone 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 Do not buy this for your children it will corrupt thier minds! Please for the sake of the children 
 I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.  But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flatline of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pagent of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was miniscule.   My overwhelming aftertast of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten 
 This is the only one of Myers' book that I read.  I disliked it early on - but I was determined to see it through.  The novel has some wit, some mystery, some cleverness - but oh what an unsatisfying mish-mash.  The writing style is skittish - from page one to the finish - so nothing is developed to any extent that you start caring about anything.  I just yearned for release at the last page.  The lack of focus was grating - but I appreciated the author's gumption of sticking to her style.  This is a light distraction - all froth and little substance 
 I grew up in one of the neighborhoods portrayed in this book, and while I believe the author has accurately described Jessica, Coco and their friends and relatives, these people are not representative of everyone who lives in the South Bronx. There are many, many people in these neighborhoods who shun the drug-dealing and thug lifestyle. These people work hard at low paying jobs (think doormen, porters, mailroom clerks, cashiers) and scrimp and save to send their children to Catholic school. They don't hang out on street corners and they don't allow their children to do so either. And they are the victims of people like Boy George and Cesar, they are the ones whose apartments are robbed, whose children are beaten on the way home from school, whose daughters are harassed.   I hate the idea that middle-class white liberals are reading this book and getting some kind of voyeuristic thrill. I suspect they wouldn't be nearly as enthralled by a book that chronicled the lives of the people I've described above, the ones who try to live upstanding lives despite overwhelming poverty and the threats of the street. 
 I've not read other attempts at Billy Joel biographies, so this one definitely contained some interesting facts that I, as a long fan, did not know.  It was incredibly difficult, however, to pull those tidbits out from the terrible and often ridiculous prose that is the writing (and editing -- hello typos -- "through" and "thorough" are not the same word!) of this book.  The author tries (too hard) to draw parallels where none exist solely for the sake of attempted literary-ness.  Commenting on the "McCarthyism" of "Good Night Saigon" (so that he could refer to another song on The Nylon Curtain as having traces of "McCartneyism"  -- get it?)?  That song is anything but.  I especially loved when the author recounted a diatribe Billy made against music industry forces that try to stifle an artist's creativity.  Billy apparently said something along the lines of once an artist lets the people who control the money influence the art, then the art begins to stink like a dead horse.  The author makes the feeble attempt to say this remark is a passing reference to when Billy's former manager and brother-in-law, Frank Weber, stole money from Billy by, among other things, getting involved in intentionally maiming horses for insurance money.  Are you joking?  People with money trying to control the artist's decision + dead horse.  Um -- clearly the author has never seen The Godfather.  Sure, Mr. Bordowitz, that's ALL about an insurance fraud/race horse scam.  Good one.  Overall, the writing was terrible and VERY repetitive.  He frequently used the exact same quote two or three times, sometimes within a span of just a few pages.  As I said, where is the editor?  I would recommend this book if you want to learn some more details about Billy Joel, but be warned.  As a book, it sucks.  Big time.  (Ultimate irony:  Read the last chapter wherein the author recounts how, at one time, Billy had agreed to cooperate with a biography but only if was a respectable author who actually could write.  And then the author wonders why it would be that Billy refused to particpate in the writing of this rag.  Hmmm.  Check the mirror, bub.  The writing stinks.  Kinda like a dead horse. 
 The publisher promised "witty & warm" I found nothing close to either. In my opion,the book was pooly written, no charm, humor or even believable. The setting was Montgomery Alabama, 1900,it could have been LA, Chicago or New York and almost any year with the lack of real reference to the time and place. The author tried way too hard to come up with unusual names for her characters to the point that it was ridiculous . I just didn't believe the characters and didn't care 
 I found this book to be very out of date, especially in terms of pricing and logistics in both Dublin and the Dingle area.  I went to Dingle, and found that the hostel they highly recommend as having a free shuttle no longer has a free shuttle or friendly/knowledgeable service.  The hostel with the free shuttle and friendly service was not listed...  Pretty much everything I used this book for was incorrect and I ended up spending much more than the cost of the book due to its errors 
 I'm not a Civil War scholar, so I'll defer to reviewers with greater knowledge about the accuracy of what is portrayed in the film.  As a film, however, this one is lacking in many ways, from hyper-melodramatic voice-overs to noticeably poor editing.  When combined with inaccurate history, the disappointment is doubled.  Andersonville was directed by John Frankenheimer, who created many good or great films, one of which, The Manchurian Candidate, is a masterpiece.  With his resume, I have to believe that the intentions of the movie-makers were good, but the end product (a made-for-TV movie) reflects an inferior medium.  A story as naturally powerful and important as Andersonville deserves a greater commitment to realism, and the drama should have been derived from historically accurate fact.   Instead, the drama was manufactured--history was dramatized. It's a film that deserves to be made again, re-written by someone with a commitment to accuracy and produced by a company more interested in the best available version of the truth than in pandering to an audience of supposed dullards with second-rate pap.  When stories like Andersonville are not told with excellence, the fall into mediocrity is precipitous and leaves me feeling that the story should not have been filmed at all 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-Dan Brown 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 For those thinking about buying this book. One word of caution, it is NOT specifically about TWC. It is more about creating a business from the ground up and ignoring critics, blah, blah, blah. I was hoping for a behind-the-sences type of book on TWC, but this is not the case. A pretty dull book IMO, but a great book if you're a business person 
 oh boy... I think the guy has some really good ideas in there somewhere but this book is not for the novice or the faint-hearted. In fact, the initiated (I've an MA) may find this off-putting. The vast majority of the main section of this book is interminably dull: a catalogue of linguistic minutae which, though put together form something incredibly profound, find my view of the wood obscured by trees.  And that is my biggest problem with the book. What's the point of having something that reviewers describe as a "milestone" in linguistics, when you lack the ability to engage your reader to communicate it. Surely, if it is such a valuable breakthrough, Baker could have done more to make it engaging.  I'm going to have to put this to one side despite it being my second attempt and come back to it later... much later 
 I wanted to like Jane Alison's "Love Artist".  I really wanted to see if she could bring new life into the story of Ovid.  Well, she didn't, and I was left feeling confused and a bit hallow.  In this tale, Ovid meets an unusual "sorceress" named Xenia, and they fall in love, and he brings her back from the Black Sea coast to his Rome, where "Metamorphosis" has just came out.  There, Ovid gains the patroonship of Augustus's only granddaughter, who dispises her grandfather so much she aborts a pregnancy, thus robbing him of heirs.  Anyway, parts of the book are quite erotic, but I don't quite understand how it ended badly for them.  Alison is too vague mostly, and this detracts from the story 
 The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.    The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 My take-away was pretty easy to define: If you are healthy or wealthy and have a guaranty that you will stay that way forever then go with the author's advice.  A state funded health program that in my case has a cost of $972.00 per month, is not a realistic option.  Sure I can save money by purchasing a seperate policy for the rest of my family, but how realistic is insurance for our family at $1,200 to $1,500 per month?  If I have high income then, OK, I've got the savings. But who worries about the savings of $1,500 per month when you have to pay out $1,800 to get it?  Answer: a person with lots of income.  This sounds like a book written by an insurance salesman - hey, it is! 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 The Seagal voice dubbing was atrocious. Almost 75% of the movie of Seagal's voice was dubbed over with another voice that didn't even sound like his. I thought the DVD was defective. In fact, even some of the bit actor's voices didn't match their lips moving. It was painful to follow and hard to watch with the bad dubbing. Don't waste your money !!!!! How could they release something so blatantly bad ?? 
 This system will not work.  Let's assume your playing in a 6-deck game. This system has you start your running count at -20, with -4 or higher as the "key" (The point at which you bet high). Using the KO method, after all of the decks are counted through the count will be +4. Does anyone else see the flaw here? Let's say you have a count of -3. This system tells you to bet high (Even suggesting 10 betting units!). But think about it, if a deck completely counted through will end up at +4, then there's a better chance that you'll be drawing low cards, meaning the dealer actually has the advantage. Put simply, if you use this system YOU WILL BE BETTING HIGH WHEN THE DEALER HAS THE ADVANTAGE. If I'm wrong then correct me, please. But I believe this is a very faulty system. If you win anything using it, count it off as luck. Eventually it will ruin you.  This book explains other counting systems as being near impossible for the average person to learn; even explaining how difficult the Hi-Lo system is (Bull). The Hi-Lo system is still the easiest effective counting system (Explained well in Wong's "Professional Blackjack") with the Omega II being one of the most powerful (Beautifully explained in "Blackjack for Blood" by Bryce Carlson). I highly recommend either one of those two systems.  There is a note in this book about the notion of blackjack books being put out by casinos to sort of sabotage counters with false tips. I believe this may very possibly be one of those books. Avoid, avoid, avoid 
 The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere.  I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending.  Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull.  It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me 
 I think I know how this book was written.  A whole lot of cut and paste from U.S. Law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in.  If you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law, fine.  But this is not the series to do it in.  
 This book is simply amazing. I loved it. It is exquisitely provactive and moving. Jenny keeps me laughing with her talented and humorous writing. I couldn't get enough. I learned so much about changing genders, family, and my own views and oppinions. This is a must read. 
 Catholics might want to know that this book has the "imprimatur," but not the "nihil obstat."  The nihil obstat and imprimatur were notations included in the front matter of Catholic religious works. The "imprimatur" (simply this one Latin word, meaning literally, "let it be printed") merely says that the Church does not oppose publication; the focus of the judgement is on whether the work should be published, on how the public will understand it.  The "nihil obstat" (simply these two Latin words, meaning literally, "nothing stands in the way") would say that the book has been examined by competent Church theologians and is free of doctrinal error; the focus is on the work itself and the author's meaning, not on the public's presumed understanding.  One might suppose that that the nihil obstat would precede the imprimatur, but these two judgements are perhaps best seen as independent anyway.  These Latin notations are not seen much any more.  Books published in English under Church auspices these days included, instead, a notation in English that the book was published "with ecclesiatical approval."    Unfortunately, this book muddies the water of Catholic belief.  A simple reading of it would see no distinction between confirmed Marian apparitions, very worth of belief, on one hand and on the other hand, for example, natural, explainable defects in photographs taken by the author.  One photograph, in particular, clearly resulted from the camera's shutter's being open for longer than the flash.  It is not "a profile of seven dove-like figures in flight," which is the sort of statement that prompts derision and, as I say, muddies the water.  For interspersed in the nonsense are, in this same book, genuine miracles and sound faith.  I do respect the author's beliefs, but he seems to have gone overboard, abandoning his critical faculties.  At least, he would need to present more information about certain allegedly supernatural phenomena, such as the three people appearing in two photographs of a scene where, according to his recollection, there were no people.  He does not say enough to convince this reader that he did not make a mistake in that recollection or perhaps in remembering when exactly, on what day, the photos were taken.  Even if the photographs were miraculous, why should we understand the three people as representing the Trinity, as he does?  This question of mine is not to say anything about the doctrine of Trinity, but only about the author's interperetation of a supposed miracle. Caveat lector (let the reader beware) 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 writer talk about too much basic knowledges which are used for 3d game programming , but most of them like knowledge of math and windows programming we can find in other books even in the course we studied long long ago. wish writer take the 3d as the point and talk more about the newest technolegies arised this years 
 This Has To Be The Worst Rip Off Ever It Dosent Even Have Angel, Draw The Line Or Kings And Queens I Definatley Wont Be Wasting My Hard Earned Cash On This Sh* 
 Oh boy, this is the worst book I've ever read. I consider myself to be well read and an intelligent human being. And this is just about the most boring book I've ever had to read. Well, I also am not much of a fan of American history, so that may influence my opinion a bit, but the fact remains, I really didn't like this book. At all. Seriously. If your looking for a very long winded book that while the language is understandable, it radiates boredom, then this is for you...or something 
 It really is hard to imagine a less important book than this. Perhaps the tedious Mills & Boone catalogue owns triviality, but this comes close.  I'm a fan of the movie with Johnny Depp and Juliet Binoche, but reading this book made me realise that has more to do with the colours, styling and performances than anything else. After the movie, I was left with a feeling of magic. The book has no such charm.  This story of an enigmatic woman and her daughter opening up a chocolate store in a small French town has all the appeal of setting and background story. It's quaint and it's lyrical, and that's the promise of this novel.  In reality, it's a dead-boring, formulaic, and utterly superficial story about a set of characters it's almost impossible to care about. The abused woman who leaves her husband; the old grandmother going blind; the prissy priest and the stuck-up town gossips. To say these are stereotypes does no justice to the depth of how cliched they actually are.  The central characters -- the chocolate proprietor and the river gypsy -- have some deeper layers, but more like a wafer biscuit than a chocolate cake.  In the end, one is left feeling nothing. Like the bland chocolate the book is at pains to differentiate the wares of its shop from, this book is a cheap thrill. And not even much of one 
 This book reminds me of the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist.  Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past.  Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.    I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact "Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and "facts. 
  ... you take a popular concept (in this case, Indiana Jones), fuse it with heaping helpings of spaghetti western trappings, and insert a Bo Derek-lookalike in the title role? Why, you get YELLOW HAIR AND THE FORTRESS OF GOLD, a lame, low-budget western from 1984 with a feeble grasp of any of the elements that made the Indy movies, or Italian westerns, popular in the first place.   Laurene Landon plays Yellow Hair, a young white woman who, as a young child, was adopted by an Apache tribe after she was abandoned (or something) by her birth parents.  Yellow Hair grows up to be the toughest kick boxer of her tribe.  We see her first as she's rather decisively beating up a young Apache brave.  Then it's off to spring the Pecos Kid (Ken Roberson) from his cell in a Spanish fort commanded by an unfunnily effeminate Colonel Torres (Luis Lorenzo.)  And then... but, heck, what does it matter?  There's a missing gold nugget that has to be retrieved so Yellow Hair's adopted mother can die easy, a horn to be blown at the Canyon with No Echo, and a Man Who Knows to be visited.     If, as seems to be the case, YELLOW HAIR intended to repeat the breakneck pace and high humor of the Indiana Jones franchise, it fails miserably.  True, the film moves from one adventure to the next, but there the similarities end.  The pacing is leaden, the jokes feeble, and someone forgot to buckle the swash.  There are a couple of interesting scenes - Yellow Hair and Pecos Kid being chased while driving a stagecoach comes to mind - but for the most part it's just an embarrassing copy of a popular formula.    
 I have to agree with the other negative reviews on this one.  I had read the previous novels in the Scarpetta series, and this one proved to be a big let-down.  The ending is a mess - too abrupt and certainly leaves you with too many questions.  Also, how does a death row inmate escape, kill two guards, and drive away from the prison when he is supposedly blind? 
 The main virtue of this book is that it presents all of the arguments in favor of an atheist worldview in one place.  The two-star rating reflects the author's clearly disingenuous representation of his knowledge about Christianity. For example: (page 18) "Christianity, therefore, defines ethics in terms of an individual's religious beliefs (which affect no one else) rather than in terms of unselfish conduct toward others." As the author perfectly well knows, this is an absurd and unworthy representation of the Christian view of ethics: Christians take their lead on ethics from Jesus, who could not have described more clearly how we are to behave toward others.  A technique deployed extensively in the book is the use of terms such as "many Christian fundamentalists" and "politically active TV evangelists" not in the restricted sense in which they are relevant, but with the clear inference that the attitudes and behaviors of such minorities are representative of Christians as a whole. The most widely used such expression in the book, however, is "creationists" - a term I have never heard anyone claiming to represent their worldview, but which the author sets up as if it were the mainstream Christian position. Now I don't mean to deny that most Christians believe that God created the universe, but the author extrapolates this in exotic ways: (page 86) "God is now portrayed as more passive in His supervision of Nature - often watching from the sidelines as Nature operates on Her own." (This describes the entirely non-Christian Deist position) (page 70) "Creationists often claim that the laws of physics govern the behavior of the universe" - this is the exact opposite of Christians' belief that God governs the universe and that the "laws of physics" are just a human construct useful for describing natural phenomena. (page 122) "Creationists, however, view scientific debate and disagreement as signs of weakness. Creationism therefore ridicules open-mindedness and scoffs at the free exchange of ideas so essential to a democratic society and to the scientific method itself." - Tell that to the likes of John Polkinghorne, Bill Craig and Roy Varghese, whose books honestly represent opposing views, using science correctly and in its proper context.   The most prevalent approach deployed by atheists (and Mills is no exception) is to use their perception of what God would or would not do in any given situation to argue that no such God exists. (Actually Mills goes one further and suggests how Jesus might better have used the special powers that Mills denies he had!) The problem of pain is perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit for such an approach, and Mills uses it fully in support of his atheist stance. Truly, I understand the problem of reconciling the amount of evil on the world with the idea that there is an entirely good God presiding over us, but the mere fact that it is difficult to do so proves nothing. Mills seems to think that God should somehow intervene to prevent anything that could cause pain or suffering - perhaps even to render people incapable of acting in such a way. Isn't it remarkable that the genre of people (atheists) who more than any other feel that we should be responsible for our own actions are ready to invoke the argument that a good God would intervene at every possible opportunity to deny our free will. I do not pretend to be wise enough to discern God's purposes, but the solutions proposed by Mills (and others) for how God should really act (apart from being utterly arrogant) are self-evidently nonsense.  One of the most popular targets for atheists is what Mills devotes a chapter to under the title "The Myth of Hell". Apparently, Mills can see no possibility of Hell, though he does consider several ideas about why God might create Hell: Deterrence, Separation, and Rehabilitation. Now again, I intend no inference that I suppose to know what God's purpose might be, but it seems that Mills has missed the obvious possibility - which is that Hell is what those who reject God freely choose. After all, wouldn't the Christian idea of heaven, with everyone worshipping God, be "hell" for atheists - so wouldn't they naturally choose a place where materialism is all there is?  I would love to say that I respect the atheist worldview, but I simply do not. If there is no God, there is absolutely no basis on which we can differentiate between good and evil; no moral absolutes; none in fact of the things that atheists rely on to argue their position.    
 This seems to be another crutch to keep children from learning true history of our country.  What is wrong with using a dictionary to look up the hard words?  Is research no longer taught in schools?  It should be apparent to anyone that learning the language of the Constitution is a part of the whole process.  How can anyone do a "translation" without political and personal bias?  It can't be done.  Dumbing down helps no one in the long run 
 I hate to leave bad reviews but in this case I'd have to advise anyone reading this book to be very wary. I am open-minded, and try not to pre-judge anything as much as possible, even it it is really really out there. This book threw me for a major loop, but when I got to the part where she is channeling the moon, and "the moon" claims that it came from an impact on the "surface of Jupiter" I almost burst out laughing. Ok, for those of you who don't know -- Jupiter is a GAS GIANT. It is MADE OF GAS. There is NO surface on Jupiter. The moon was most likely formed when a Mars-sized object struck the surface of EARTH and knocked off a bunch of rock, which went into orbit and slowly formed the moon.  *sigh* Like I said, I hate giving bad reviews but as someone from the stars, I can't endorse this at all. Sorry 
 Fun to watch but my 9 1/2 yr. old daughter could not follow the moves.  Neither could I for that matter.  We tried to learn the moves through "breaking it down" but there is just not enough repetition.  Too complicated.  
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 these covers are pretty bad. some good ones have been done, cameron mcgill @ the uncommon ground tribute, big sir's everybody here wants you is good, but this is bad, no matter what entertainment weekly's review might say. avoid, buy a REAL jeff or tim album 
 Loved the 1st release. Bought it after hearing her performance at the Bethel Perfoming Arts Center in NY during the jazz weekend in Aug '06. Some of my favorite songs with lots of intelligent sarcasm and truisms. I listened to the 2nd release and was totally bummed. Poorly produced (stick with the elders, their mass appeal talent is why they stay in business), no bite (but lots of screaming), and generally dull. Not sure what Lauper and Lang contribute since the combination of 3 voices with unique styles is grating. Hope she considers a 3rd release and gets some help in performing and producing it.  
 This book was a big disappointment to me. Its premise has so little substance that it does not even rise to the level where it can be tested with truth.   Lindsey heads a pro-globalization think tank, as well as being employed by the Cato Institute and Reason magazine.  These organizations all espouse extreme libertarianism.  What that really amounts to is not far from Vonnegut's notion of the money river - some are close to it and some are far away.  So Globalization lets the money river get bigger and it thrashes about, changing its course, giving young opportunists like Lindsey a chance to get closer to it as it continues to ruin the environment.  His theory is simply a veiled version of the latest far right form of red baiting.  Anyone who suggests the government needs to rein in big business is a communist.  Only someone as young as Linsey, too young to remember the red scares of the fifties, could say such things with any seriousness at all.  You'll have to go elsewhere to get any useful information about globalization 
 This book was written for a series on the ART OF WAR.  In effect, it is a generic book on Vikings, derived from secondary source material. the best parts of the book are the discussions of source material at the very end.   The author seems not to care about his subject enough to search for the  correct verb, make the conclusions presented consistent with the facts  provided, or thoroughly learn his subject. The editing of the some of the  charts and tables is poor, the one on page 59 about Magyars "mopping  up whatever enclaves have escaped the Viking assault from the sea." is  laughable - almost certainly not the fault of the author. The sections on  navigation, its hazards and ship building are shockingly bad. The phrasing  in some of the sentences creates unintentional humor e.g. "for all  their much- vaunted military muscle the Vikings managed to erase only one  race permanently from the map of Europe- the Picts- and even then it was  surely not out of any deliberate policy of genocide."  The choice of  the verb "managed" implies an effort at genocide and "even  then...surely not" implies that they SHOULD have had such a policy.   Again slipshod editing.  Finally, the tone is more suited to a book on  politics -and P. Griffith does demonstrate a mastery of polemics- a lot of  "attitude" shows through which is often at variance with the  information presented.  A good editor could have helped. There are many  good scholarly works on this subject, (Gwyn Jones and P. Sawyer for  example), but this is not one of them 
 This book does not give answers or examples to do most of the activities.  For example, on the descriptive writing chapter, it does not provide sample vocabulary to describe smell or taste.  Instead, it tells the learner to consult a dictionary 
 I have to say I agree with some of the other reviews here, that this collection of poetry by "Rumi" is in reality modern American poetry by someone drawing only very loosely on Rumi's work. It is rather a stretch to call it a translation! If one were cynical, one might think the large number of books from this "translator" indicates merely a money-making exercise.  Much better collections/translations can be found, like Maryam Mafi's and Azima Melita Kolin's, but I would personally recommend Juliet Mabey's Rumi: A Spiritual Treasury. This is not only a gorgeous book to look at, but more importantly, both its selection and English rendition demonstrate a deftness of touch that make you think you are reading something very close to the original sentiment. A rare achievement 
 Mr. Haqqani has dubious credentials as he has served in a number of very corrupt governments in Pakistan's problematic history. Although I agree with some of his views overall he has vested interests that do not allow him to be a honest contributor to Pakisan tumultous history 
 I had to read this book for a history class in college, and I must say it was a poor choice for the class.  The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they.  He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities.  The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening.  It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history 
 The movie is fine, but............... There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service 
 A more apt question would be; what do the Okinawans eat or what do the Hunza eat? Those are two healthy, long-lived civilizations. The Swiss rate right up there as well so why not ask what they eat? 
 This book didn't base the story on a specific character as a narrator so it was boring.  I learned what happened in the American Revolution.  I didn't like it very much.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  Even  if you like learning about the war 
 I am very disappointed and shocked by this video. I took it out from our public library with high hopes for my children who enjoy Dr. Seuss books. Mixed into this video of bits about different Dr. Seuss stories are images of swastikas, Nazi's and even Hitler. Apparently the author of Dr. Seuss books did a documentary during W.W. II and footage of it is included in this video. I strongly feel that this is inappriate for children to watch. There are scenes from Kristallnacht - when the Nazi's looted and burned Jewish stores. Why was this included and why isn't there a warning on the box? I do not want my children seeing images that will stay in their mind of these terrible things. I am shocked by how many positive reviews of this video are listed. After informing my local librarian of the contents of this video, she removed it from the children's section 
 The book is well-written, not a pot-boiler, but it was hard to work up any empathy for any of the main characters. If the author had killed them all in the middle, I couldn't have cared less. 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 I would have to agree with the majority of assessment of this product on Amazon: this product fails on every count. 1.	Most significantly, product does not perform as described.  Signal strength not "significantly improved."  In fact, no change in reception at all.  I have used this in my one-story home and in a café I work at with no effect whatsoever. 2.	When there is a rebate, it is more trouble than it is work.  [... 
 The set is VERY small and the pins are so small that they will not even stand up on their own.  It is cheaply made, choose another bowling set 
 I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson. So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying: - the keys are not comfortable to use. - it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time. - putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot) - you can't set the camera shutter to be silent... - you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones... - you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.  And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)  Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp 
 James Patterson's Violets Are Blue is another of his Alex Cross mysteries, which are always a good summer read.  However, some are better than others and this isn't one of his best efforts.  I'd rate it 2-1/2 stars.    In Violets Are Blue, Dr. Cross has yet to jump ship to the FBI and is still working for the Washington, DC police force.  He is called to San Francisco when two joggers are found brutally murdered.  Their bodies are hung upside down from a tree and most of their blood has been drained from their bodies.  Their deaths seem to be the work of savages, and Cross had a similar unsolved case back in DC.  At the same time, he is being stalked by The Mastermind, a psychopathic criminal who seems to have a love/hate relationship with Cross.  Cross teams with the capable homicide detective from San Francisco, Jamilla Hughes.  Together, they crisscross the country, trying to follow the trail of savage killings as they try to find the key.    I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books, although the plot to Violets Are Blue is just a bit of a stretch with the vampire angle.  Also, the discovery of the identity of The Mastermind was a complete surprise, but also a bit unbelievable.  In Patterson's defense, I would have probably enjoyed it more had I read this book before The Big Bad Wolf.  If you're a Patterson fan, you have to read Violets Are Blue.  It will tie up some loose ends from previous books.  I will continue to read the exploits of Alex Cross--even though not all Patterson's are created equal.   
 First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.  Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.  As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!  If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too.   Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from 
 From this book, I learned the Famous Price-to-Rent Ratio and it comes to my mind everytime I preview a property.  It will teach you the seven things to look for in a bargain.  One of these items was new to me.  Buying REO requires two things to succeed:  expertise and money.  This book can help you with the expertise part but if you don't have some investment cash...you probably should seek another income stream.  Lucky for you (and me), real estate has several income streams to pursue.  
 I actually dont own the cd but ive heard enough of his stuff to want to rip my f#ï¿½kin hair out. Yeah he pretty much sucks all around 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 I've read as many of Heyer's novels as I can find and there's something to like or love about every one EXCEPT for "Royal Escape". The characters are flat and there is no plot!! I only finished it because I hoped that it would get better and Ms. Heyer's wit would shine through. No luck- I didn't even like the character of the King. please, don't spend time on this when you could be reading the Alastair Trilogy (These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, etc.) or "The Masqueraders", all of which are absolutely marvelous 
 Like many of you are thinking about, I bought this through a website (Apple). I bought it based on the name brand, partnerships, and design (I must admit, it is a very nice design - in theory) figuring, "Hey, Nike invented this additional sensor and must have figured out a way to fit into a nice little package...I'll spend $30."  IT DOESN'T FIT CORRECTLY & YOU CANNOT SEE THE SCREEN. This armband is NOT FUNCTIONAL! I even tried to make it work by fitting some tissue at the bottom to raise it to its "intended" position, but inevitably the tissue shifted during the run.  I used the Nike+ armband a total of three times over a 10-mile period and IT CAUSED PROBLEMS DURING EACH RUN.  First, I had trouble adjusting the volume. Second, I accidentally kept pausing my workout trying to play my "Power Song" (center button on Nano).  Third, on my longest run, just today, I accidentally erased the workout trying to end the workout without taking the Nano out of its case (I still don't know how I did this).  I was so frustrated after that third negative occurrence that I immediately went out and bought a different case. I'm not going to name drop, but just type in NIKE+ armband and there are several other options (okay, I will name drop).  My favorite, (especially because I did not want to purchase the Nike+ shoes) was the Marware Sportsuit Relay; this set comes with a neoprene Nike+ sensor pouch (to attach to your current running shoes) and a wrist/arm band that covers the entire Nano with room for the additional Nike+ transmitter. Bottom Line - Nike+ system and partnership with Apple Nano = AWESOME! Honestly works perfect and I couldn't be happier so far, but don't give Nike any more $ for this specific armband. Hopefully we will see enough bad reports, and Nike will come out with a new, more functional design. 
 Ignore the hype. This is poorly written and just plain dull. 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food).  This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"?  Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley 
 Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters.  Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais.  Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.  Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character.  The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades 
 I am getting into Benchrest Shooting and gunsmithing match quality rifles.  I was hoping that this book would give me some good info and teach me some new techniques.  Unfortunately the book is pretty dated and is more suited to hunting rifles and actions.  The illustrations are sometimes blurry and all are in black & white.  There is some good information but there are a lot better books out there in my opinion.  For benchrest precision, I just got a book from John Hinnant titled "Complete illustrated guide to precision rifle barrel fitting", it is a lot better.  YMM

 A long, stupid and boring story that you MUST read and memorize at college for quiz tests. I still wonder how studying this most unimportant account of a most unimportant guy is going to help me become a better Mechanical Engineer 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.   However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.   That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.   You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs! 
 This book is a waste of your time!  The author takes many pages philosophising about rediculous concepts which are untrue and misleading!  It ends by him giving a method whereby everyone can completely justify all their wrong actions!  What can be further from the truth 
 Extracts from the online disgnosis2012 (dotcodotukslashcalldothtm) review that also apperars in the book Beyond 2012:  Swedish researcher Carl Johan Calleman noticed that since the tzolkin can be used as a map of the 13-baktun cycle, it could theoretically also be applied to the larger cycles that have been found on a few stelae, (a stela or stele is an upright lab or pillar with an inscription or sculpture and the plural form is stelae) such as stela 1 at the Coba - a ruined Maya city in the forest sixty miles east of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan. Then he noticed that if this is continued upwards, a cycle is discovered that is close to the scientifically accepted age of the universe. To explain this further, we must first look at the extended version of the Long Count calendar.  Twenty kin or days is one uinal (20 days); eighteen uinals is one tun (360 days; twenty tuns is one katun- 7,200 days (about 20 years); twenty katuns is one baktun - 144,000 days (about 400 years); twenty baktuns is one pictun - 2,880,000 days (about 8,000 years); twenty pictuns is one kalabtun - 57,600,000 days (about 160,000 years); twenty kalabtuns is one kinchiltun - 1,152,000,000 days (about 3.154 million years); twenty kinchiltuns is one alautun (about 63.08 million years); twenty alautuns is one hablatun (about 1.26 billion years); twenty hablatuns is about 25.2 billion years.  What Calleman realized is that thirteen hablatuns would be equal to about 16.4 billion years, which is close to the usual estimate given for the age of the universe; about 15 billion years. If the pattern of the 13 x 20 Sacred Calendar or tzolkin encodes larger sacred cycles, such as the 13-baktun cycle, he reasoned that a whole cosmology of 13-unit cycles, rather than twenty-unit ones, could be represented in a nine-step pyramid form, such as the Pyramid of the Jaguar at Tikal, Guatemala, or the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque, Mexico (the one that conceals the tomb of the ancient Maya ruler, Pacal). In this way, the top or ninth level would represent a 13-uinal period, while the bottom or first level would represent a 13-hablatun period.  So, the topmost layer represented the 260-day tzolkin of thirteen uinals. The next level down would be a 260-uinal cycle of thirteen tuns. The next level down would be a 260-tun cycle of thirteen katuns (this is a cycle normally known as the Short Count). Under this would be a 260-katun cycle of thirteen baktuns (this is the familiar 13-baktun cycle). Below this would be a 260-baktun cycle of thirteen pictuns, and so on. In this way, we would have a nine-level pyramid, where each layer is structured like the tzolkin, but twenty times larger than the layer above.  This is a very intriguing idea, showing how the development and evolution of the universe could be encoded into the structure of the Maya calendrical systems, from the creation of the universe until its final consummation at the end-point. At the junctions of each level of the pyramid, humanity gains another "frame of consciousness", and although Calleman says that speculation on the consciousness that will be accessed at the "summit of the pyramid" would seem to be "almost pointless", he does indulge the reader a little. It will be an end of time, in which no more calendars are needed:  "...the attainment of a time-less cosmic consciousness, and an experience of unity with All-That-Is in its fullest sense, a disappearance of the line dividing life from death. Although many that live today have had temporary experiences of such a cosmic consciousness, these have only been temporary, due to our limiting frame of consciousness. At the end of Creation this may no longer be so and the eternal life may in fact manifest as a time-less cosmic consciousness."  If this sounds familiar, maybe that is because it is based on "several ancient scriptures" that turn out to be mainly the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation.  Calleman supports the True Count, as opposed to the Lounsbury correlation, but he realised that his theory would be much neater if only the Long Count had ended on the day 13 Ahau in the tzolkin, instead of 4 Ahau. Incredibly, he decided that the Maya had got it wrong, and says that although he still agrees with the True Count of the tzolkin, the correlation between the Long Count and the tzolkin was wrong. This is something nobody had questioned before, since there has never been any doubt of the tzolkin - to- Long Count correlation; it was set by the Maya and wherever a stela shows the Long Count, it shows the relevant tzolkin date. Previous arguments had concerned how the calendars relate to the Gregorian calendar, not how they relate to each other. Calleman criticized Arguelles for creating his own New Age Dreamspell count, yet has not seen the parallels to his own creation. In fact, he says in reference to later "invented" tzolkin correlations, "Such disregard of the calendrical knowledge of the Classical Maya is not likely to lead to truth", but this applies equally to his own invented Long Count correlation. The result of the change in correlation means that Calleman sees the 13-baktun cycle as starting on June 17th 3115 BC and ending on 28th October 2011.  There is a problem, however, because dividing by twenty works fine until we get to the level beneath the summit of the pyramid, when we find that thirteen tuns is 4680 days, and a twentieth of this is 234 days, not 260 days. Calleman admits this, where he refers to "The short universal cycle of 2011, probably totalling only 13 x 18 = 234 days, but possibly 260 days..." Two diagrams on p.77 of Calleman's book differ on the length of this last cycle - one says 13 x 20 days (260) and the other says 13 x 18 days (234). If the tzolkin level (the Universal Underworld) is shortened to 234 days, so that the pattern (of each level being a twentieth the size of the one above) is retained, then the tzolkin as the key 260-unit "filtration pattern of divine light" is unable to form the top level of the pyramid. Alternatively, if the 260-unit tzolkin is retained as the top level of the pyramid, so that each level consists of 260 sub-units, then the top level will be only an eighteenth the size of the level below, whereas all other levels are a twentieth the size of the level below. Since both solutions lose the symmetry of the pyramid, Calleman is clearly undecided as to which is correct. This brings the validity of the whole pyramid construct into question.   If Calleman had stuck with the Maya Long Count correlation, the idea would have remained an interesting concept, but the idea that the tzolkin "ends" on the day 13 Ahau and "begins" on the day 1 Imix is, in fact, "based upon a misconception of the tzolkin calendar" due to modern conventions in representing it, according to John Major Jenkins. Therefore the alteration to the Long Count was not necessary, and Calleman could have presented the idea without resorting to inventing his own correlation. Calleman now has quite a following, and supporters are presenting his theory as "The Mayan Calendar" or saying, "The Maya say..." when they should say, "Carl Calleman says..." His book is titled The Maya Calendar: Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time, but his solution is being taken as the genuine Maya Calendar, when it is an attempted explanation that got out of hand and ended up "massaging" the facts to fit the explanation. Amazingly, José Arguelles has written the introduction to Calleman's sequel book, just as several websites are attempting to combine the theories of Arguelles and Calleman... and even Jenkins. It seems that people are so wary of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, that they have poured all the water into one bath, inadvertently drowning the baby

 THE "MOVIE" WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE - HAVE A BASIC PLOT AND MAKE SOME SENSE.  VANITY IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN - SHE WAS EXPLOITED IN THIS "MOVIE".  I WATCHED ABOUT HALF OF THE "MOVIE", TOOK IT OUT OF THE DVD PLAYER.  SINCE I COULD NOT RETURN IT, I GAVE IT AWAY 
 Theres ups and downs in this movie. To me mostly downs. When I first seen it in theaters i loved it. So when I got the DVD ,iloved it.3 months pass i get sick of it. For 3 reasons First The picture looked blury even on DVD. Second iz the actin iz the same. Third just lookin at DMX abusing 3 women by getting them addicted to coke and heroin. And him abusing his own son, what is wrong with that man. I think this movie make X alot Crazyer.I wouldn't reccommend this movie for relegous people, HELL NO!!!! If you worship the devil andU want to die,And like looking at people being killed ,then it's strongly reccommended 4 U 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 I love, love, love, Lipglass normally.  But this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer. 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 The book has a compelling argument, because many of us would like to think that racism is a thing of the past.  It takes away the responsibility from people to end racial inequality, because racism is no longer the cause.  I agree with Wilson that class inequality is bad and that it does impact African Americans.  However, there is a store of research showing that racial discrimination still plays a real, solid role in the continued marginalization of Blacks. You would be hard pressed to find an African American who has not experienced racism.  While, the book is not devoid of scholarship, it needs to be approached with caution.  Be critical of what you would like to be the case and seek out what is trully the case. 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Sally Mann hasn't a clue how to capture the souls of those she photographs!  If you are looking for artistic shots of 12 year olds then this book isn't for you.  The picture on the cover is deceiving about the books contents.  You're better off with buying the David Hamilton books (oh and by the way he is much better at photographing his subjects than Sally Mann could ever hope to be).  
 I picked up this book after reading the great one-page summary in Outside magazine.  My suggestion is to go and buy the January 2006 issue of Outside magazine and read the great one-page summary.  The summary has many of the best suggestions from the book, but it is concise and well edited.  The first thing that struck me as I glanced through the book was that is consists of 200 pages of almost pure text with very few illustrations and no photos.  As I started plowing through it, I noticed that the prose was littered with an inordinate number of asides and parenthetical comments.  Consider this gem: "So we tend to think runners are better than we are, and because they don't really fight the image (probably more out of preoccupation with their hamstrings than egocentrism, in their defense), that keeps a lot of us - who doubt we're ever going to rule at anything - from running."  At first I assumed that the author was a exercise physiologist who just couldn't write, but then I realized he is a journalist who writes too much.  The book is actually pieced together from articles that appeared in Outside magazine and it reads exactly like one huge magazine article.  The problem is, writing a good book is a lot different than writing a good magazine article.  I would say that about 50 percent of the text could be deleted with no harm done.  The production design of the book is especially poor - it focuses on style rather than substance.  The few illustrations are wasted on highly stylized drawings unsuitable for a technical topic.  There is almost no variation in font size which makes it difficult to pick out main points.  There are no chapter summaries and precious few bulleted lists.  There are some good points in this book if you can find them.  The book covers a wide variety of topics and I did find a few things potentially worth adding to my workout.  Most people, especially beginners, would be better off looking elsewhere.   
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 For starters, if you want to start saving money then don't buy this book or waste the gas to get you to the library!  By far the WORST wedding book I have ever read (and I've read lots of them).  This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event.  Using olives as an "appetizer", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays "for free to get experience" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was.  I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried.  The fact that the author kept plugging her other stupid wedding planning books was almost as tacky as some of her suggestions. Right up there with the tackiness of a cash bar.   
 A quite differnet style of learning is presented in this book of which I am still undecided on it's usefulness. Basically the book is show by example with not much theory or explantion. This is an absolute beginners level book and due to the books lack of theory I question its usefulness but some do learn better by example.   It does cover step by step how to do some things in Visual Studio which would be very helpful for beginers and possibly provide a little help for the experienced. The book does a good job of explaining how to do things in the IDE while most provide little to no help in this area.  My real beef with the book is the fact that it starts from the begining and this is not implied by it's or Amazon's descriptions. This book should have beginner written all over it. Chapter 2 is titled 'How to develop a one-page web application', chapter 3 is 'How to develop a multi-page web application', chapter 5 is titled 'A crash course in HTML' and chapter 8 is 'How to manage state'.  If you have done more than a couple of ASP.NET projects, any version, I would not recomend this book. While it does cover some of the ASP.NET 2.0 features it's not worth all the other fodder that comes along with it 
 This Workbood back-fired.  The theory appears sound, but when it came to my wife and me working through the Workbook together, we found a serious trap (surely unintended) by diligently following the instructions, exactly.  Session 7 is entitled "Re-Romanticizing your Relationship I:  Caring Behaviors."  It directs each person to list the behaviors he/she has "always wanted but have never asked for."  The instructions then elaborate by saying the wants may be "your vision of a perfect mate...may be private fantasies or secret desires."  They fail to limit the scope.  There are some behaviors over which a person may have no control such as medication side-effects or physiological depression.  Following the instructions blindly and trusting they allow for and deal with such situations. I honestly included some desires that my mate is unable to provide. These lists were then exchanged. She appeared to accept them at the time, but they actually caused her a great deal of anguish.  So my wife now knows my fantasy wants but she cannot fulfill them even though she would very much like to.  This left her feeling inadequate to the point she gave me an "out" of our relationship of many years.  That is the last thing I would ever want.  As a result, I am quite angry and feeling very guilty.  Looking ahead to the next sessions, not only do they not deal with this type of possibility, but they use these lists to intensify the exercises.  I should have known better.  We threw the books in the trash.  We have  spent a good deal of time overcoming those feelings of hurt and regret.  From the beginning, I have had trouble with the title as, to me, "wants" has its roots in selfishness 
 If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and "maybe" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd 
 Author is really good but the way SIP described in the book is a kind of child-story , details on important parts of SIP and on unified services are skipped instead make-up parts are highlighted 
 First off, his website www.farrelltrading.com, which he constantly references, is gone. (he's even misspelled it once so far)  Admittedly, I'm submitting my review only half-way through the book, but this is nothing more than a modern day alchemist spewing garbage across 200 blank pages.  The author has a very (very) poor understanding of mathematics and economics. An example in chapter 1 confuses buys with shorts. His examples take some rather advanced topics and reduce them to the point that they verge on being dangerous to the reader.  He doesn't explain that his examples (beyond being in dire need of an  update) are not real-world cases at all. They're idealized examples that would breakdown the instant a reader places his or her faith in this book and tries executing a trade.  The book poses a few questions, gives the solutions, and in a poor attempt of filling the pages, ties the two ends together in any-which-way (and often in a rather erroneous way).  One example of this: Farrell tries to explain the differences between "thin" and "thick" stocks, sighting in his nonsensical way, that stock splits are the differentiating factor. period. the end. ...what he fails to explain (and understand) is that splitting is bad not because -as he reasons- there's now too many outstanding shares, but because of more complex reasons like the company is trying to open it's stock to a larger audience for more to participate in (which, by the way, is not necessarily a bad thing.. just a choice of styles).  The dust jacket looks nice tho.    1-star for being a passionate writer (albeit a myopic debutant).  1-star for the dust jacket 
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However, when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been  $1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too. Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it. Jeanne Alle 
 I found her first book fresh, new and laugh-out-loud funny perspective on the human condition.  Her "sequel" books rehash the success of the original book with a few new tales contributed by her wannabes thrown in; dull, flat, uninteresting.  I'll keep the original - I'll pass on the res 
 I love Le Carre and was looking forward to this film.  But what a mess!  The plot is a mishmash -- after about an hour I no longer cared what might happen to the protagonists.  Excellent actors like Ralph Richardson and Anthony Hopkins are wasted in secondary roles.  Other reviewers say that this movie was edited to death and I believe it.  Save your money.  Maybe they'll release Spy Who Came In From The Cold on DVD some day 
 I must say, I was quite disappointed by this book.  There's way too much psychoanalysis and far too little historical info.  Personally, I'm not interested in Mr. Asher's lay-psychology.  I read the book hoping to find detailed biographical and historical info.  What I got instead was a poorly written psychological analysis written by an amateur 
 This was probably a great magazine article before being padded out with geography and feminism history lessons. The story of the team and girls is great, but too much non-basketball stuff. Also more about the years they didn't win to set the stage would have been nice 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 The story of Galileo is much more complicated than just being a "heretic".  In order to understand the full complications of the story, one would have to understand that the problem was not Galileo against the Bible, but Galileo against Hellenized Christianity-- Aristotle and Plato; the creeds of the church fathers, i.e. the Apologists, etc.; in other words orthodox Christianity which had come under the domination of Greek Philosophy.  What Galileo was arguing against was NOT in the Bible, it was Catholic Church doctrine mixed with Greek Philosophy (the metaphysics of Aristotle and Plato) which is still prevalent in some fundamentalist Protestant sects.  I fully understand that this is a children's book, and even some adults would disagree with my review.  This is due to ignorance of Church history and doctrine, not to mention bias and prejudice.  Therefore, I am only writing this to encourage older readers to look more deeply into the situation between Galileo and the Church.  Although I am not a Catholic, and definitely not a Catholic apologist, the Church is usually portrayed in a worse case scenario than they deserve.  Always remember that the Church at that time was also the secular judge and jury, and that they tried very hard to work with Galileo, who, at times, was kind of a behavior problem.  Before you have a knee-jerk reaction and say this review did not help you, remember that educated people will read this, and you could end up looking very ignorant.  Do your homework first.  All is not like you've always heard about Galileo. Atheists and agnostics love to put their own spin on things.  Just ask the Boy Scouts of America. 
 If you want to learn about Paul Feig's sex life...read this book. There isn't much humor in it, but you learn what a lame-o he was 
 Well, I was really prepared for something special.  Not!  This is a book for Cityfolk.  Those of us from the Heartland know how to do these things or have a pretty good idea and know where to go to learn.  There was nothing special for me 
 Entire book looks as if it's been photo-copied. Some pages have text cut off where the photocopy hasn't been done properly. Do not recommend buying this book 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 I found this book rather boring. I thought the biginning was hard to get into. There were some unnessacary discriptions that just seemed to add on to the pages in the book. I noticed I was daydreaming numerous times, which was a sign I wasn't into it. Near the end of the book it got a little more fascinating. I enjoyed some ending scenes that had a little more action. Overall, it was an O.K. book. I wasn't overally thrilled 
 I'm fascinated by the rave reviews for this text. I used it for a community college stats course and once I was in the classroom with it, I became aware that I had some problems. It is true that it's written in a friendly style and has plenty of exercises, but I found it to be poor preparation for my students who will be going on to higher levels of statistics in behavioral science courses.  I found myself explaining, more times than I wish to recall, how formulas look different in other statistics books, and I was disconcerted at the lack of use of symbols that one usually sees in beginning statistics courses. Simple terms most commonly used in statistics were not introduced at all, and most statistical tests were not mentioned. Many students found it to be cumbersome and a bit overwhelming.   It's my own fault, really. I did not spend enough time perusing texts. And my familiarity with statistics prevented me, when looking it over, from realizing how much was really missing. I realized that my students would enter bachelor's programs lacking some very basic information that is always used in statistics for the behavioral sciences. Most of my students plan to earn graduate degrees; I had to spend quite a bit of time preparing notes for them as well as lectures explaining formulas, symbols, and terminology that "some of" their higher courses might use. And with nary a mention of ANOVA or any other higher level tests, I felt I really had done my students a disservice.  I began to wonder - have I been out of school so long that things have changed this much and I'm not aware of it? But - as I am teaching at a state college, stats texts started trickling in from other publishers. I saw that it was not me. This massive text, costing my students $120, is lacking quite a bit that they should be exposed to - to better prepare them for future statistics studies in the behavioral sciences. This was certainly a bitter lesson for me! I had to waste far too much time putting together information that was missing just so my students would have the course they should have.  I recommend Sally Caldwell's text, "Statistics Unplugged" for beginning students - at least in behavioral sciences programs. It's a third the cost, a third the SIZE, and much more reader-friendly. And it contains the information that I had to supply to my students just so they would get what they paid for.   I do not recommend this book. I'll certainly be much more careful in future when choosing textbooks 
 I don't recommend you to buy this item, its sound is poor, and there is a static noise when the car engine is on. 
 Out of the trio of albums Tears for Fears completed in 80's before they split, 'Seeds of Love' stands out to me as by far the weakest. TFF started out in 'The Hurting' as a synth band comparable to Depeche Mode or New Order, and while they were always making pop music, the instrumentation they used provided a unique, creative, and interesting sound. While the singles from Songs from the Big Chair were huge pop hits, TFF continued to create interesting sounds via a combination of synths, samples, and real instruments. Songs on that album like "Listen", "The Big Chair", and "Empire Building" were instrumentals and blatantly abandoned radio-friendliness in favor of creativity.  In 'Seeds of Love', the dark lyrics and interesting synth sounds that defined Tears for Fears seem completely absent. By comparison to their previous albums, Seeds of Love feels like "easy listening". TFF touches on some interesting beats in a few songs, but these introductions quickly give way to cheesy, traditional, over-produced pop sounds.  The album's title track, "Sowing the Seeds of Love", summarizes in one song the entire direction of the album (as compared to TFF's previous work) quite accurately. Listen to this song; if you enjoy its' uncomplicated traditional pop quality, then you may well like the whole album. However, if you're like me and "Sowing the Seeds of Love" strikes you as too poppy, too cheesy, and lacking the interesting sounds that made other TFF tracks enjoyable, then don't buy the album; the rest is just as bad, albeit less catchy.  If you ask me, 'Elemental', the first album made after the break up, sounds like a more appropriate follow-up to 'Songs from the Big Chair' and 'The Hurting' than 'The Seeds of Love. 
 ok, to everyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars, GET REAL!  at most this is 3 stars, but only because of the funny samples, which really dont count as songs. there ARE a couple of good songs and a couple good "half-songs". dont get me wrong, im a HUGE sublime fan.  if you really love sublime like I do, buy this, but dont make it a top priority, maybe buy it used or something.  like the others say, sound quality sux, production sux.  this is really like a novelty cd, not a real album.  trust me, no matter what the other guys say, NO-ONE listens to this cd regularl 
 i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it, i was disappointed. the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse. also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me 
 This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.   If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society 
   Bone Collector  Upon the opening scene of the movie, I was highly upset.  It was only after the movie had begun that I realized I didn't buy a porn.  C'mon!  Bone Collector!?  That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal.  Nice one.  You won't get me again.  It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles.  This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy.  He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds.  He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!!  Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick.  Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads.  Only, there are a few major plot-holes: 1)	There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments. 2)	There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull. 3)	There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with. 4)	The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is.  Things learned from this movie:  -Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role.   -Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy. -I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity.  The fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now.  Leave.  In the end it's a mediocre movie from which I expected more.  Given the combo of Washington and Jolie, there really should have been greatness.  It's a preposterous renter at best 
 I initially bought this item at my local hardware store.  That unit stopped working after 2 days.  I returned it thinking it was a fluke, and bought it again from Amazon for less $$.  The second unit stopped working after 2 HOURS.  I called DeLonghi's 800 # and the service person was evasive when I asked if this is a defective product.  I'm very frustrated with the amount of my time this product has wasted.  In the mean time, I work in a home office w/o heat and I've even caught a cold b/c I haven't been able to keep warm thanks to this piece of junk.  I would rate it ZERO stars if that was an option 
 The book is dull, and not what I thought it would be. It is not illustrated well. I would like to return it immediately. Please tell me how I can return it? 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 As I am not referenced in the book, do not have the same surname as the author and did not contribute to the work, I am less impressed with 'Crossroads' than the other reviewers.  In complete agreement with the sentiment that there is little quality information on Hecate, I purchased this book before it was reviewed, but would not recommend anyone else to do the same.   It gave a muddled account of the known history of this dark goddess, confusing speculation with fact and giving no information I had not discovered elsewhere. Confusing witchcraft with wicca and christian concepts, the ceremonial focus of the rituals dedicated to Hecate AND Hermes and the contradictions inherent in the work left me disappointed.  The second chapter on how certain individuals had discovered Hecate was interesting but not enough to justify the cost of the book.  Grammatical errors, sweeping generalisations and narrow referencing did little to improve my opinion. I found the book to be well-intentioned, but at times slightly confused.  There are some great websites out there giving you the same information and additional background (e.g. Hecate's Cauldron) for those with an interest in witchcraft rather than wicca. Unfortunately, instead of expanding my knowledge on the subject, this book left me with nothing but a feeling I had wasted my money 
 This book, like the Atkins approach in general, has part of the picture, but is certainly incomplete.  Moderation, not virtual elimination, of carbohydrates, when paired with lean protein, plenty of omega 3 (fish and flax oils), and monounsaturated oils (like olive oil), has been shown to be the healthiest diet (a Mediterranian type diet). The Atkins approach does not advocate moderation, instead prefering to vilify an entire necessary macronutrient - carbohydrates!  Certainly the old fashioned 1980's style high carb low fat diets were a disaster, and brought out diabetes in susceptible people - but the answer is balance - good quality, naturally high fiber carbs, paired with protein and healthy fat - not virtual elimination of carbs.  Inadequate carbohydrate intake can lead to fatigue and reluctance to exercise.  Dr. Vernon herself continues to struggle with her weight, despite following the Atkins approach. Most Americans will initially lose weight when starting on Atkins because most eat FAR too many carbs.  But they also eat too much saturated fat (animal and dairy fat, for the most part), which has been show to worsen insulin problems and diabetes, and aggravate cholesterol and artery inflammation, worsening risk of heart disease and stroke.  Atkins addresses one of the these culprits (excess sugar), but not the other (excess saturated fat).  Americans need to cut down on these, and then add more good fats (fish, nuts, olive oil, avacado), lean protein (to cut down on saturated fat), and not be afraid of healthy carbs in the form of whole fruits (not juice), vegetables, and whole grains (not white bread or sugary low fiber cereal).  That, plus watching the calories, and daily exercise (at least 30 " of moderate cardio, five days a week), and diabetes will DRAMATICALLY improve.  Try it and see! Health is not just about weight - its about healthy body fat and muscle ratios, and what is going on inside your body - in your arteries, your brain, etc.  The studies all support healthy balance.   
 On page 40 she states, "55% of patients reported that bran made their IBH worse and yet the 1st recipe in "20 Recipe You Cannot Live Without" is Raisin Bran Muffins! Whereas in the definitive book on IBS "Eating for IBS" says stay away from whole wheat, milk, cheese, and red meat (which I followed and it solved our IBS problem), this book pushes whole wheat, whole milk, eggs, and dairy.  "Eating for IBS" helped. Following the recipes in this book would not 
 Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference 
 I do believe I"d like it more if I recieved this book but I haven't  tell me Amezon where did it go? 
 I bought this text as a self-study aid, primarily because the book is advertised as including the solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter.  I was very disappointed to find that the answers are provided, but the zip files for the solutions are password protected and made available to only universities.  What a shamocary.  Other than that, the book has proved to be very light in the discussion section and heavy in the problem sets - so the solutions are very much needed to derive any good use from the material.  
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 One of worst of the newer "collector" books out there.  There isn't even a color chart with the names, you need to deduce them by flipping through all the pages and guessing at collections of variuos colors and doing a process of elimination.  Fakes are mentioned, and the author says "you'll know them when you see them".  Thanks alot! All the marks aren't even listed.  What about newer peices versus old?  Some Encyclopedia, more like ramblings of a collector.  The medium green issue is already covered by others, the book mentions it everywhere but gives very little evidence of it (maybe the author has medium green envy?).  Not worth the bargain price spent on it.  Certainly not a reference book.  p.s. I give other collector books 5 stars, so I'm not just a grump 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 This has to be Dolph's suckiest movie.  I'm a huge fan, and I own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis.  But do not buy this movie, save your money and buy one of Dolph's better movies like Army of one or Men of War.  Personally though I'm pumped for the release of masters of the Univers 
 Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern "superstars". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, "Words Get in the Way". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of "Conga" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS 
 This was NOT a good book, unless you are of a highly advanced level in model railroading. All the "layouts" were poor paintings, which you couldn't envision easily at all. This was not a good book 
 To call Billy Graham humble after reading his autobiography is to call the Pope poor and underprivileged!  Graham comes across as a seeker of prestige and fame.  He tosses out names of the rich, powerful and famous----even infamous----on just about every page.  He is a living testamony of why we should have a stricter/wider separation of church and state. And, as another reviewer has written, there is no real substance to the story. The book would have been better if "autobiography" had been omitted from the title 
 This is quick revisionism from a hired gun. Perhaps the events of the Clinton presidency are too soon for anyone, liberal or conservative, to be objective, but it will never happen if people keep buying books like this 
 I read this book this last year in highschool for English class.  It was awful!  First of all it's really confusing and second of all it's just a stupid plot and ending.  It was so boring and so long.  Don't read it it's a waste of time 
 This book focuses on a couple driving home from a party. His drunken wife asleep, the man apparently, though NEVER explained, stumbles into a ghostly situation and area. It haunts him and the story was spooky and original - almost like a old legend you've heard with terrifying creatures - when it wasn't being dragged along, or missing pieces. Again, Mr.Golden chooses a weak male as the character; he pieces things together slowly to save his possessed wife and the little girl that haunts him...When the ending comes, you'll be asking yourself "why didn't he do this, or "why did that happen that way"? because it just doesn't make sense! There are too, too many loose ends left untied that will leave you wondering, and even more things that just aren't addressed. Again, great story, but not worth reading with so much missing. Like clues that are never explained. Why is this house unfindable, and yet located in every country? Why was the main point of the story- the little girl - no longer important near the end? I'm so annoyed. I'm going to have to re-sell this 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I can't believe this guy actually writes books about dogs for a living.  As other reviewers mention, he needlessly kills Orson after Orson bites three people.  The first bite seemed to be just a case of Orson being a little too rambunctious, but the second and third bites were caused by people reaching into a fenced area to pet Orson, without getting the owner's permission or without knowing the dog first.  Orson was killed because people are stupid.  Besides, if you think your dog might bite someone, might not you put up a BEWARE OF DOG sign before he bites more people?  Although this guy took Orson to pet "psychics" and "shamans" to try to fix him, it never occurred to him to try take some precautions around his farm to keep Orson from biting people after the first bite.  Much like Marley and Me, this is a book about a really stupid dog owner who cashes in on his dog's suffering and tries to justify it as making a tough choice for a dog he loves.  Don't believe it.    If you want to read a truly charming and heartwarming book about dogs, try "The Dogs Who Found Me."   
 I had to buy this book for my class. This book doesn't instruct how to input equations. Not enough example answer codes for each problem. Less visual and tedious to follow all words. 
 I will admit that the text is not bad.  There is some good advice on every aspect of photographing children.  However, what is bad about this book is that the photographs are just horrible.  Compositions are poor, lighting is poor, focus is poor.  If you are looking to learn a lot about photographing children, you really won't from this book 
 The subject of this book is relative of the author who back in the 1840s, converted to the faith of LDS and moved to "Zion" (Utah) where she met with hardship and situations that did not meet her expectations. The book proves to be well written but poorly researched. It doesn't help that the author's objectivity was compromise because she was the author's grandmother, several times removed.  In this book, it seem like Sally Denton is going out of her way to slam dunked the Mormons. Obviously, Jean Rio was misguided or misled about what the LDS was all about. Her ignorance seem to be classical that its based on blind faith and once she awaken to it, she discovered much to her dismay that her new church may not be all that she thought to be. The author stated that the Mountain Meadow Massacre was the cause of her defection but it seem all to pat to this reader. There seem to be a lot of mountains made from this molehill.  I don't think her researched is all that well done. The author depends too much on diary left behind and make several conjectures which are not fact based. The book feel more like a personal biography of author's grandmother (several times removed), its short, readable but ultimately unimportant due to lack of depth to the research. While the subject person was important to the author, its seem like a story of dissatisfied customer. 
 This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on "Surrender" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex.  "I Like" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose 
 This was my first Val McDermid book, and as skilled a writer as McDermid obviously is, I'm not sure I can handle another one!  Serial killers seem to dominate crime fiction today, and TV shows like CSI have made extremely graphic blood and gore fairly commonplace.  Nevertheless, the truly horrifying serial killer in "The Mermaids Singing" (a title I still don't understand) and the frightening graphic descriptions of torture in this book will probably be giving me nightmares for quite some time.  Even the main characters, profiler Dr. Tony Hill, and Detective Inspector Carol Jordan, are depicted as seriously flawed individuals.  While I was rooting them on in their search for the serial killer nicknamed "Handy Andy" (another reference that didn't make any sense to me), I found myself wishing for a "hero" and "heroine" with fewer emotional insecurities.  I guess I like my heroes a little more heroic.  Instead of another Tony Hill - Carol Jordan story, I've decided to try one of McDermid's Kate Brannigan novels.  Hopefully, it will be a bit "lighter" and won't keep me awake at night 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Although the setup for this movie's plot was interesting, the story gradually unravels in a mess of implausibility and a clunky climax. Campbell Scott is believable, but Rebecca Pidgeon's acting is painful to watch, and her reading of lines is amateurish and sounds too forced. (Perhaps her husband, director David Mamet, should make his next movie about the perils of nepotism.) It is unclear why her character would try to help Scott's character from being captured by the police, while continuing to lead him into their hands. There are countless holes in the plot, and the ending does not tie up several loose ends 
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 This is about one of the most useless manuals I have ever purchased for a game. I say this with the manual for TES Oblivion as a guide for what a game manual *should* be.    There are only the very shortest of blurbs for each quest in the main storyline available.  There are NO side-quest walkthroughs or guides, so if you're like me and have completed Act II before realizing there were people you were supposed to have recruited for Crossroad Keep, well you're hosed.  Not only Crossroad Keep, but any side-quest you may have missed.  I've found out tons of important and necessary info on the NWN2 Forums that simply do not exist (and should) in this official guide.  I'm just astounded at the complete lack of any real, useful information in this manual.  They spend the greater part of the book talking about Character Classes (in the free guide in the boxed game), Spells and Equipment, and very little of it going through what matters most.  The actual gameplay.  I've rated this two stars because the enemy stats, maps, spells and equipment breakdowns are interesting and sometimes *gasp* helpful.  My overall recommendation is to save your money and check out the official NWN2 Forums for tips and help, or GameBanshee for a useful walkthrough. 
 I have been reading the history of this period for over forty years. This is the worst bunk I have ever read. Here are my reasons. 1, He fails to cite his sources. 2,He fails to prove his thesis. 3,He contradicts the very title by stating that books never vanished from Italy, Greece, and the most Romanized parts of the western Roman world. 4,He pads the book with a ton of extraneous info that has nothing to do with the topics. 5,He inexplicably bashes other groups for no reason. Lastly, the so-called style is a disorganized, and incoherent rambling. I suggest that before anyone wastes their money. They read all of the reviews of this book wih a fine tooth comb and an open mind 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 I found the heroine (ZD) so flatly written that she could only come off as a selfish, flightly idiot. She never has a chance to be a real person nor to have any real character.  To anyone reading today, with any smattering of enlightenment, I believe Zulieka Dobson will be frustrating and annoying.  She's set up to make a mean-spirited point.  I suggest picking up Evelyn Waugh or Nancy Mitford to get some fine writing on the society of the between-war period and the English upper classes 
 Just kidding. Actually, Massachusetts has nothing to worry about. The people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as Martians would (an effect Fellini was deliberately going for). The only reason I rented this disc is because John Lennon once said that the Beatles' life on tour was like Fellini's Satyricon. I can only hope that the Fab Four's nights in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan were more fun than this movie. More a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative, Satyricon (just how does one pronounce it anyway?) bets eveything on its visuals. Some work and are impressive, but after a half hour, even diehard film buffs will tire of watching Fellini try to top himself every five minutes. I hated Fellini's La Dolce Vita. But, being a good sport, I decided to give the famed Italian director one more shot by watching this. I don't think I want to go for strike three anytime soon. One could pretty much watch the scenes in any order. As an added annoyance, it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming, just like they did in the spaghetti Westerns. Since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists, one only has imagery to go on. So, let me describe the movie in montage form. We see large slabs of meat, bonfires, fat pedophiles, fat homosexuals, thin homosexuals, a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice, an annoying poet with a beautiful voice. There are midgets, galley slaves, oily wrestling matches, a sweaty Minotaur, heads chopped off, mutilations, suicides, a man swinging from a noose, lots of froliking, little real sex and no eroticism, an earthquake, sabers, Centaurians, dusty vistas, squeaky wagons, a pasty-faced demi-god, painted woman, painted men, loin cloths, art work, and as Cosmo Kramer once said, lots of unbridled enthusiasm. What does it all add up to? Two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted. If you want great imagery in a foreign film, stick with Werner Herzog's work. 
 I wanted to, I really did! But I just can't bring myself to do it. I read "One True Thing" and "Black and Blue" and loved them both. My copy of "Object Lessons" mentions B&B on it, which should have been a dead givaway that this was a weak fledgling effort first novel by the author, which it was. Oh, it had it's moments, but they were few and far between. Overall the feeling was just sadness bordering on depression, the kind of novels that were in abundance in the 70's. Perhaps that's when she wrote it. I would not recommend it to anyone 
 Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.  The only good thing going for this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken".  This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)...   When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.  Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.   Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.  I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..  I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer... "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money" caused you to revisit a "cult figure"!   Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!  Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A."  The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One!  
 Well, the one fact that is listed, is it is short, perhaps because anything longer would have strained the intelligence of the author of this rabid blathering right wing bigot as all of us with any sense realize is the true Stephen F. Hayes.  There are NO facts here, not even mere morsel of anything that leads one to believe that this is anything more than the illiterate rantings of this overzealous right wing bigot.  If you feel you must subject yourself to more mindless drivel on facts that have already been shown more than once to be otherwise than Mr. Hayes always wishes you to believe, then, yes, if you must waste your time, please go ahead and read it.  But do everyone a favor, do not buy it, it is on used bookshelves for a pittance, seems no one with a mind wants to have it in their home either.  So, wish to waste your money, and your time, go ahead, tired of the same mindless drivel and want to read something that at least resembles  intelligence, do yourself a favor, look for something else.  This is just a disgusting bit of rag written on dirty dishrags from the burrows of the right wing bigotry club. 
 Unless you are extremely experienced with Silver and Gold items and what / where their origin may be, this book is probably not for you. The chances of being able to find what you are looking for reminds me of looking for a needle in a haystack. The marks are illustrated in VERY SMALL 1/4" black and white diagrams, column after column, put in tables with time period or comment in print that is even smaller than the diagram. Several (bordering on too many) of the marks look very much the same and after looking at 170 pgs of extremely small and not necessarily clear diagrams and images, I feel I should of spent my money elsewhere for info on silver ID 
 I seldom pan books, but this one is little more than an egotistic rehash of simplified versions of AI/AL theories of the past 3 decades. The only new data are the author's opinions. If you are looking for anything new and/or in depth, look elsewhere 
 I agree with all the negative reviews on this list about this disc and Lang Lang in general.  I was deeply disappointed with his performances of the Tchaikovsky/Mendelssohn and Rachmaninov concertos.  Then, my friend asked me to listen to his Islamey, exclaiming that it was one of the most remarkable performances he'd ever heard.  I remember clearly thinking how boring it was and had to have my friend listen to the incredible performance by Ogdon and, even more brazen account (remember this piece ismeant to be a showpiece, and not the pseudo-intellectual piece Lang Lang thinks it is) by Barere.  Although I'm no fan of Islamey, I find it very easy to discern the difference between mediocrity (Lang Lang) and brilliance.  I got a chance to listen to some of this disc couple of months ago, and boy, he continues to disappoint.  Regarding all those who say he's the next Horowitz or Richter blah blah, I suspect that these people don't know history.  Another fundamental mistake they make is that they form conclusions without comparing to other performances.  Just compare his interpretations of the abegg variations and the Wanderer fantasy to those by Kissin or Richter.  You'll quickly notice how pedantic and uninspiring Lang Lang's accounts are.  Boring as I don't know what!  Likewise, try comparing his Tchaikovsky's 1st or Rach 2nd to those by Horowitz, Argerich, and Freire, and Richter, Kissin, Cliburn, Ashkenazy, Jando and countless others.  Lang Lang sounds absolutely amateurish in comparison.  Memory can be very fleeting and the only reliable thing is to compare side by side.  His mediocrity just jumps out and grabs you.  I'm willing to admit that my main objections to Lang Lang's musicality is subjective in nature.  Afterall, taste is taste.  While I find Lang Lang's tone terribly uneven and dull, with his interpretations without life, with his general stance of "let's not mess things up here" attitude, others may indeed find him exciting.  However, I will not concede that his technique is somehow "one of the greatest."  To this day, I cannot figure out how one can consider his technique to be great.  Just sit in a dark room, close your eyes and dissect his articulation, finger work, phrasing, octaves, and you'll notice that no way in hell does his technique measure up to those by Michelangeli, Hamelin, Barere, Berman, and Horowitz, or even to those by Leslie Howard, Kissin, Zayas, Argerich, Gould, Gavrilov, Cziffra, Kocsis, and Pollini.  To me Lang Lang's technique is dead average, nothing special, and for those who think his technique is one of the greatest in history or at least one of the greatest around, perhaps more listening and studying is required.  Sure, Clint Eastwood is a solid film maker, but to say to me that he is in the league with Orson Welles, Jean Renoir, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock would lead me believe that more film study of the classics is in order.  In conclusion, Lang Lang (and this disc set) is a joke.  People tend to think that because an artist is heavily promoted by a large record company like DG, then he must be good.  This effect can be very powerful and, now in this era, often very wrong.  If classical music continues down this path of promoting dead average pianists, then we are all going to suffer 
 It didn't take long to realise that this book was the odd one out in my rapidly expanding chess book collection.   It's neither a classic to read nor a book to learn from such is the paucity of its material. There is far too little in this book and too lightly covered to be of any use to begginners or intermediates. Judging from its style, it would be of very limited value to more advanced players.  I'm very surprised that the book refers to middlegames at all as it has almost no material on development in the middlegame, how to create plans or execution of same.   Rather you will find a focus on a single theme of double attack/double blow. If the publishers had called this book "Double Attack - Essential Knowledge" it would have been far more accurate but far less sellable. Hence my feeling of being conned.  I could give several suggestions of much better treatises on the middlegame including Vukovic's "Art of Attack in Chess", "Secrets of Grandmaster Chess" by Nunn (for more advanced players), Silman's "How to Reassess Your Chess" or my current read - Euwe and Kramer's "The Middlegame".   The latter book is for serious chess study and leaves this Averbakh book for dead.  In short - there are many, many books far better than this trivial piece. Use your money on one of the other books instead 
 I bought the CD since I was going to see Crossfade open up for Alter Bridge and I liked Cold the first couple of times I heard it.  Then I listened to the rest of the CD.  Words can't explain how bad it is.  Cheesy rap-rock with over-used power chords is probably the best description.  The songs all sound the same.  The lyrics border on ridiculous. And to boot, they are even worst in concert.  Most of the people sat and watched them act like kids on stage while a group of 5 high school kids banged their heads to the music.  They have a dj who messes around with turn tables and tries to rap, with the keyword tries.  He is the most pathetic want-a-be that I have ever seen.  After 2 listens, I gave the cd to my little sister who loves Cold.  This is a terrible band and a terrible release 
 While much of the information is correct there are glaring mistakes throughout. The authors seem to rehash the same words from other publications, neither bringing something fresh nor accuracy to this story. I feel if someone is going to write, whether for an elementary school child or a academic society they need to do their homework first and make sure their facts are straight. The pepuation of heresay with no substantiation is just not right 
 This is an utter and total waste of time and money.   Be real to yourself and your child, get some professional advice, not this pathetic drivel 
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 In the actual text, the word "shocking" was in scare quotes and meant exactly the opposite of what it seems to mean here 
 Except for two things - I gave up on Irene Adler when I read that Chapel Noir was volume one and Chapel Rouge volume two.  I feared more Chapels.  I do keep reading Midnight Louie's adventures but the later ones aren't as much fun as the early ones.  If I'd have known I would have to read 27 books, I would never have picked up Blue Monday 
 Not what I expected when renting this movie. As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent.  Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world?  Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway?  Blah.  The acting was OK. The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged.  And as another put it, I was very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket.  I read a lot of historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but there was no liking this one. It just couldnt be done 
 If you are new to JavaScript and looking for a helper title, this isn't it.  If you're already familiar with JavaScript, and need specific information, you probably need more than an extremely condensed pocket reference is going to provide.   There really isn't anything wrong with the pocket reference - it has correct information, formatted pretty well, and contains the most common parts of the core language as well as the common DHTML references one needs for general use.  What it doesn't have, and shouldn't for a pocket reference, are complete explanations for the components, or any usage examples - two things needed by people who are turning to a reference book.  JavaScript is really too complex to be summarized along with DHTML elements in 127 half-sized pages.  If you're looking for a JavaScript reference, purchase the authors full-sized reference guide, "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" (ISBN: 0596000480) instead 
 Book offers too simplistic and barely entry-level formatting and ideas.  The styles were all basic and not varied enough, and the jobs were all low level.  I am a marketing director and the upper level resumes they had were still so basic they were not useful as examples.  Might be good for high school students, though 
 The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 My parents gave this book to me when I was a kid because I was a "late bloomer".  I really think that was the beginning of my self esteem issues.  I was unaware that I was a "late bloomer" until they pointed it out to me by giving me the book.  I can remember being so sad reading it and thinking there was something wrong with me.  Now that my daughter is a bit of a late bloomer, it's gotten me thinking about this book.  Please don't buy it for your kid.  If you do, please explain to them why you're giving it to them.  Don't leave it to them to draw their own conclusions that they are like Leo they can't do anything right 
 It got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it (a month or so later) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly. A huge disappointment and waste of my money 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 The best researched work on the subject matter by Greg King and Penny Wilson who not only did exhaustive research in the USA in preparation for writing the book, but also traveled to the sites in Russia where the action took place digging in archives never before viewed by other researchers. Time travel at its best! Unlike most authors Penny Wilson is a researcher who reads, writes and speaks the Russian language. 
 I saw the title and said, "Wow, now there's a gutsy premise."  Then I read the book.    In a nutshell, readers will endure a poorly compiled and inconsistently edited lesson in literary point-of-view.  It does not (even argues that it cannot) point in the direction of truth and discovery as the title suggests.    Instead this book encapsulates the thinking of small minded people who think they are on to something big.  While I wouldn't rate this as low as raw conspiracy theory, it doesn't deserve much better.  Instead of reading this book, I suggest the reader of this review skip it but repeat aloud the following points (at least three times):  1) I will think for myself. 2) I will not believe everything I hear, see or have been taught. 3) I will try to think divergently (outside the box, in ways unlike those around me, creatively, philosophically, theoretically and/or extremely practically). 4) I will always consider the source as well as their information. 5) Why am I repeating something some stranger suggested in an Amazon book review? 6) If I really care, I will find out for myself instead of believing the things others tell me. 7) Everyone has an agenda (particularly politicians, media outlets, reporters & authors, wealthy or religious folks, radical idealogues, publishers and especially writers of book reviews.)  Welcome to enlightenment!  (You're now ready to conquer the world. 
 This book features an incredibly lame plot and even lamer dialog that is so corny it almost seems like parody. Then there is the obnoxious phrase that two of the main characters say to one another ad nauseum: "But...(dramatic pause, I assume) I saw you die!" I wish they had seen ME die so I wouldn't have had to finish reading this idiotic book. Take out this phrase and the 500 page book would probably be reduced to 450 pages. This was the first - and last - David Morrell book I will read 
 I thought this was an complete and utter prententious waste of time. I watch hundreds of videos a year & this is the only one I've had to fast forward through most of just to keep a glimmer of interest. It's not really about the history of Russia at all. In fact, it's not about much of anything. It's more of an exercise in cinema, a bad idea that should have been tossed aside. The cinematography & art direction was nice but other than that it was cinematic doodling 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally. BAD BED 
 I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing.  I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).  The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc.  The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing.  Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.  All in all, don't waste your money on this guide.  You're better off buying the Brady version instead 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer.  
 I just finished with this book after solving the six categories of tests and scoring myself. I then tallied my highest categories and looked up the careers recommended for a person of my talents. Believe it or not, at the graduate level ALL of the careers recommended were those of a scientist or science intensive. Yeah, imagine that. Not one non scientific career. Now guess what? I am a young physician-scientist and I DONT like my job at all. How wrong can the recommendations get! Been there, done that and know for sure that this isnt the field for me.  My genuine interest is finance and banking and while I got a well above average score in the business test, several questions seemed to rely on knowledge one would be expected to glean from an MBA or by working in the business world, and not any innate ability. Having never gone to B School or worked in a Business Industry, I felt short changed. Whats more, a test remarkably similar to this one had been administered at my school when I was in the tenth grade and I was told that I was most suited to a career in science.Ironically enough now I know that that is the one career I can say for sure isnt the one for me. Go figure 
 the radio won't shut this stupid song off. I mean, other then "The Reason" by Hoobastunk(lol), I think this is the most annoying song ever. again, good song at the start but how many times can you listen to one song before it gets "boring". & honestly, I thought Maroon 5 sang this song, lol. this guy needs a more unique voice. I really don't see this guy staying long in this business, one hit don't make yah a star. sorry, but after this song is forgotten, he will be too 
 eh.  i was dying to read this after geography club (that book rocks) but this one....like i said...eh.  it was campy.  sigh.  i guess campy is is a bad metaphor considering that we are talking about gay kids at camp, but i can't think of a better one.  the only good part was the love triangle between russel, min and a bisexual fellow camp counselor.    the burn victim metephors were too much.  i mean, come on...burn victims facing a forest fire????  how imaginative.  let me guess...russel saves the day?  oh, that's right, i forgot, i read it. 
 I agree, this heater ssssllloowwwly warms the room. I'm still sitting here freezing my buns off! 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The first year or so, the characters made me think being 13 would really be this simple and fun. Reality set in pretty fast, however. Ann Martin lightly tiptoes around subjects like disabilites, absentee parents, and divorce. As a child of divorce from the age of five on, I found the butter-smooth TV-sitcom resolutions of (I think) two characters' parental break-ups downright insulting, even at my young age at the time.   Ms. Martin, you are doing girls no favors with this one-dimensional cotton-candy fantasy teenage world, written only for cold hard cash. How many are there now, 500+? Speaking of which,  my mother bought a second copy of the first 1986 printing of BSC #1 and still has it sealed in plastic like a mint-condition comic book. Maybe in 40 or so years, or after Ms. Martin kicks the bucket, whatever comes first, it'll be worth a little $$ for us. Just food for thought. 
 I bought this book while I was living in America and have just gotten around to reading it.I wish I had not ,the pages are badly set out with to many side bars making it a pain to read .Also there is not enough good information in it to make it worth buying.A note to the editor if you produce this book for the British market you want to use another word than Tosser this is not a nice word over here and may offend some people 
 I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by.   However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.  I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 I found this DVD to be extremely disappointing, especially when compared to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Highilights DVD by Reedswain (and I don't think Reedswain has produced one for the 2006 WC).  If you want to see a bunch of goals, one right after the other, then perhaps you'll enjoy it.  However, I think this DVD utterly and completely fails to capture the excitement, anticipation, electric atmosphere, and beauty of the tournament.  To me, it was a passion-less production.  There is little to no pre-match analysis/introduction of the games being played, or its star players; there is no break in between the goals from one game to the next; and there are no highlights other than goals. I know, that's why it's called "All the Goals", but without other meaningful highlights, the goals are seen out of context and are almost meaningless.  For instance, how can you not show Zidane's infamous headbutt on Materazzi in the final, and how it affected the game?  This DVD doesn't.  And what about the drama of Australia scoring 3 goals in the remaining 10 minutes against Japan, after Japan had been leading 1-0 the entire game?  This DVD captures none of that drama.  If you just want to see all the goals of WC 2006, you can do it for free at the FIFA WC website.  They even show some great highlights as well, but there's no commentary.  And no, I am not affiliated with FIFA in any way, shape, or form.  
 Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film 
 I was encouraged to buy this book by all of its positive reviews, but was disappointed to find it to be almost completely useless for me. First, our training seminars are reasonably well established: I was looking to better "market and promote" them, as the title of the book says. Unfortunately there are only 2 or 3 pages on this subject in the entire book, and they are little more than recommendations to buy the books & tapes from other promoters that the author works with.  This book does not provide helpful information so much as it plugs the author's many other products that promise to do so. It reads like a self-help book from the 1990's.  I was looking for a professionally presented source of good usable information (something that we provide in our seminars) but instead got a hard lesson on used car salesmanship 101. I am confident that those who leave my seminars got their money's worth, but I expect that Fred Gleeck makes a lot more money at his. Two different ways of doing business, I guess 
 The book does use chocolate bars to model the use of arrays for multiplication.  However, the concept is clouded by the tangental reference to different artistic styles used to write the numbers.  At times I thought I was reading an art book instead of a math book.  The additional information detracts rather than enhances the concept of multiplication.  There are better texts than this one to help with multiplication 
 Mr. Mef will always have a very soft-spot in my heart. As a hardcore Clan head, Meth has always been one of my favorite rappers in the game, with his gruff, but smooth delivery, and rhymes so witty, you'd press "Rewind" every ten seconds. The P-A-N-T-Y-R-A-I-D-E-R made a name for himself in Enter The Wu-Tang, and he followed up his amazing performance there with the first Clan solo album, Tical.   Tical was fantastic. The Iron Lung showed where he was coming from, as each track on that album was streaming with gold, and to this day, it remains one of my top ten hip-hop albums. However, something seemed to happen.  Meth had some classic guest appearances throughout the early nineties, with fellow Clan members, and friends outside of the circle(most notably, Notorious B.I.G. and Redman). Wu-Tang Forever dropped, and Meth was still in top-form. Then something curious happened. The long awaited sequel to Tical, Tical 2000: Judgement Day dropped, and it was, to put it gently, not too good. His album with Redman, Black Out, holds on that same opinion. Many, many guest appearance later, and Meth dropped his third solo LP, Tical 0, and to say that stunk would be an understatement.  I wanted to like this album. The Wu's been putting out some great releases in the last couple years, mainly from Ghostface, GZA, and Masta Killa. I wanted to believe that Mr. Meth could drop a FishScale, a Grandmasters, or a No Said Date. I wanted this so badly.  We can't always get what we want.  There's one thing that Clan heads know, and that is the production the original members sound best flowing over. Ghostface sounds best over soul samples, Inspectah Deck over funk, GZA over gritty, yet epic beats, Raekwon over theatrical beats, etc. Method Man sounds best over the gritty, yet funky production that only RZA can provide, and on the cuts RZA does produce, this album shines. However, when Method Man takes the Scott Storch rote, and flows over polished, and overproduced beats, he just sounds so misplaced.   This album is highly dissapointing. While it isn't completely worthless, do to a few of the great cuts(The Glide, 4:20, Presidential MC's), it could've been done without. This album is Tical 0 with a few RZA joints on it; that's all. I still love Meth, don't get me wrong, but this album is just another stain on his respectable legacy.  Sorry, Johnny, but a lot of things have changed in the last 13 years, and none of them have been for the better 
 The first 6 dragonlance books (Chronicles and Legends Trilogies) remain for me, the greatest works in Fantasy ever written.  The poor rating I give to this volume is due only to the useless commentary that I so hoped would provide insight into the story.    What the authors merely do is provide offhand comments that either repeat themselves or detail things that I found uninteresting.  I was seeking more detail into what Raistlin had experienced in his journey, ie..what actually went on when Soth and Raistlin first encountered each other in Shoiken Grove.  What did Raistlin face when he entered the Abyss and battled the Dark Queen's army.  Why did the mage council simply not kill Raistlin outright.  Why did the Dragonlance Adventures book have such inappropriate stats for the characters involved in this story.  Alas, none of these were answered 
 I am watching too many of these Italian movies.  I am starting to recognize the people from other movies and be familiar with the names of actors/music/special effects from other movies.  I really should stop watching them because I really don't like them very much.  I am more interested in gore comedy and these gore movies without the humor of a "Dead Alive" or "Terror Firmer" tend to bore me.  This movie is more for the straight gore fan.  There is someone stealing body parts in a hospital.  There is a mad doctor taking off skull caps and changing brains.  There is cannibalism.  There is a machete stuck in someone's head for self-defense.      My favorite one was the main character using a boat prop to scramble a zombie's face.  I wish there were more things like this and I might have enjoyed it more.  It was poorly done however.  From what I have heard this is a popular cult favorite for this type of movie however the makers seem to have made it without much inspiration besides making money.  I really enjoy the special features of these types of movies (which I guess is one big reason I continue watching these types of Italian gore movies that I don't really like).  I enjoy the stories behind the movies, etc.    This one had an interview with a special effects person who I recognize from the Zombi 2 bonus features (I think it was from there?).  I am pretty sure the interviews for this and Zombi 2 were done in the same setting.   It seemed to me this was probably done right after the interview for Zombi 2.   In this one he seemed annoyed by repeated questions from the Zombi 2 interview.  His attitude was an annoyed "As I said before..." like he didn't realize the previous time was for a different dvd?!    Also he was asked how the special effects were done.  Basically he said he didn't remember that much about them.  He was also asked if he was satisfied with the special effects.  He said he didn't ever see them on film as he has never watched "Zombi Holocaust".  "I guess they turned out ok because I heard it made money".  This was different from the Zombi 2 interviews (his and others) where they were excited and proud of their work.    I have never seen special interviews where the interviewees are not interested in the movie and telling the story.  It was funny to watch this 
 I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck 
 I have never personally read a Martha Grimes novel before reading The Blue Last.  It was an interesting mystery filled with details.  For some that may be excellent but for me I did not enjoy this novel as much as I had hoped to.  I felt that the author cluttered the point up with unrelated issues.  On the other hand the author did well with keeping you guessing up to the end.  I also enjoyed how Martha in this story takes us back to the past and the bombing of WWII.  That was a terrible time in history and is filled with memories that the main character Jury wishes to forget.  It is a great theme in the novel that you can not escape the past and that it often holds glues to the present 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours. 
 This book starts with a simple question and assertion.  Most scholars claim Captain Cook was taken for a God when he arrived in Hawaii(much as Cortez in Mexico) but this book claims that this narrative is 'racist' and 'eurocentric' and a classic 'imperialistic myth'.  The idea here is that the narrative assumed Cook was a god(not that he was mistakenly taken for one) because the racist Europeans of the 18th century beleived Europeans really were gods to the 'natives'.    But this argument falls apart when one realizing what it is based on.  The book wants to be the new 'Orientalism' and the author claims that as a 'Sri Lankan' he is best placed to judge what Hawaaians a dozen generations ago thought of a European.  How rediculous.  THe difference between Sri Lanka in the 20th century and Hawaii in the 18th is as different as Captain Cook's culture in England in the 18th and the culture of the Hawaiians.  The racist assertion that a Sri Lankan can better judge a Hawaiian than a European is unfounded, perhaps the best person to judge a Hawaiin is a Hawaiian but it doesnt logic that a Sri Lankan would be better than a British person.  Thus the idea presented her is simply wrong headed.  It would have been better had this book re-examined how Polynesians and Hawaiians in particular viewed Cook, rather than claim that every piece of the Cook story is 'racist'.  What was Cook supposed to do?  Not sketch the people he encountered, not write about them, he was in fact being very forward thinking in bothering to learn about the cultures he visited.  Seth J. Frantzman  
 The premise was good and could have made for a good story line.  But come on, please.... am I really supposed to believe that Ben and Danielle can conduct all of these super human exploits with hardly a scratch?  They seem to pop up everywhere, just in time to save the day, while everyone else gets picked off like fleas!  Their wounds seem to heal supernaturally!  And then I'm supposed to believe that a pot head who's stupid enough to believe that he's going to get all A's for the semester because he's helping the government, can crack the computer code that none of the big boys can?  Nah...  I like my protagonists a little more human, capable of mistakes, and more believeable and thereby likeable.  I don't think I'll be reading any more of Land's books for a while.  This one supposedly took place over a 12 day period and that was about 11 days too long for me 
 After taking a long, considered look at the reviewvs available for "From Here to Etrenity," I noticed that many of them were giving 4/5 stars to the book.  Which then made me consider.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?  This was undoubtedly the worst book ever created.  It is considered a WWII novel, and yet there's only one chapter of combat in it, which doesn't even contain any honest-to-god fight.   Pearl Harbor was not considered a battle.  It was considered a massacre.    As I read this book, I could not help from falling asleep.  The few times I was awake, however, a strong passion to burn this filth raged like a fire within me.  How can anyone cosider this book decent.  All it is is getting drunk, going to a whore-house, getting caught, and then doing the same thing over and over again until either killed, arrested, or moved to a different continent.  The main character, Robert E. Lee Prewitt(called Prew by many), dies about 150 pages from the book's ending!    Ladies, and gentlemen, as I conclude this review, I ask you one thing.  Do not buy this book, and most surely do not read it.  Reading " From Here to Eternity" is like chewing on broken glass, except 100 times less fun. 
 The argument that there must be a higher power because there is too much complexity is childish. Just because we believe it to be complex does not require that something as intelligent as a human (or more so) was needed. Check out The Blind Watchmaker by Dawkins for a superior argument.  I also just wanted to note to Cymry9876, and to others, that Antony Flew has not "converted" to theism as has been often claimed. How do I know this? He announced his position to a crowded auditorium at a conference on Secular Humanism in Amherst, NY. Misinformation does not an argument make 
 I might not be entirely fair for me to rate it because I didn't even finish it, but I couldn't manage to drag myself through this tedious book. I felt like I was wasting time and grey matter. Filled with inane jokes about dieting/being fat/being old, this book is like sitting in a room full of middle-aged women and having them giggle out platitudes like "Remeber: Dessert is stressed backward!" (yes this is actually in the book). If you like that kind of thing, you might love this book. I'm not one of those people.  The tips given in this book are about as obvious as they get (volunteer, work part time, do what interests you, etc.) and if you need a book to tell you these things you're gonna need a lot more help than just this book alone. The anecdotal bits are an interesting enough read, though IMO not enough to carry the book through its plethera of regurgitated advice. There are better books out there, and this might be a decent enough read if this is your first exposure to such topics, and if you don't mind the trite comments (to be fair, it was only a few per chapter), but I personally thought it was a waste of time and money. You'll be finding my copy in the used section 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day.  I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy.  The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places.  The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit.  I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy.  I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better.  Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality.  
 I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted.  The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc.  Very disappointed 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 Don't waste your time on this, it's nothing but a glorified comic boo 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 Unfortunately, I never got to use it as the iPod would not charge. Looked very cute, but never got to use it...Returning for a refund.. 
 This book is very hard to follow and is badly put together. find a different book to study transpersonal theory 
 This book was not actually written by "Larry the Cable Guy," but a gentleman named Dan Whitney.  Whitney is the human being who plays the character "Larry the Cable Guy" in concerts, movies, TV shows, CDs, and now this book.  What Dan Whitney really thinks about anything is up for conjecture, but he certainly knows what he wants people to think his character "Larry the Cable Guy" thinks.  In that way, this book succeeds marvelously, it makes fun of all the things Whitney has observed as making LTCG fans mad, and like president they all voted for, he tells them what something is and whether it is good, bad, or funny (i.e., jesus = good, fart = funny, being retarded = funny, not supporting the Bush administration = bad) and requires only confirmation by repetition of the catch phrase title of the book, and purchase of sundry items bearing the same inscription.  It is brilliantly targeted and presented for maximum cash-in value, with very little discussion and no thought involved at all.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be a  Larry fan because you don't even have to know what is funny, good, or bad, just wait for Larry to sum it up in the simplest little joke imaginable.   That is because he has calculated that if he talks in a thick southern accent (the origin of which is never revealed because it is an amalgam) people will think "wow, he really must be a down to earth fellow to unabashadly parade his hick background instead of trying to "unhickify" himself to reach a wider audience.  The unhickified Dan Whitney was boring and not funny, so he devised the Larry character to play on people who thought a brash, "honest" guy from the south was more funny.  It's a beautiful formula, and Larry is a gazillionaire as a result.    He may have paid  a few visits to a Waffle House to take notes, but you can be assured that establishment does not cater the spread on Dan Whitney's Gulfstream V.  So if you're wondering whether Larry sounds like he's from east Texas, western Louisiana, central Alabama, northeast Arkansas, Northen Florida, southern South Carolina, or smack dab in the middle of Georgia, don't labor too hard, he comes from Nebraska and the accent is fake.  Just like all the heartfelt nonsense in this book he is simply describing what he thinks the big fans of LTCG want to hear.  So if you want to be told what you want to hear by what is basically a cartoon character, instead of engaging in thought about a real human being, then welcome to the world of Larry The Cable Guy.  Just like Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, and Jesus, he's not real.  Is that un-PC enough for you, Dan 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Its title deceives us.  We expect to see things like "kittens are cuddly," or "mothers love us."  Instead we read "snow is white," and "rain is wet."  We are led to believe there is something important in "whiteness" and "wetness," but these are merely descriptions of the world about us.  In giving such bland descriptions, the author attempts to derive values from facts, in effect deadening our senses to what should be depicted for children as a wonderful world.  The fact of the matter is, there's nothing important about this book at all.  Discard it! 
 Before I start - SHE DIDNT EVEN WRITE THIS BOOK AND SO SHOULDN'T BE CREDITED.  I watched a programme a while back on Victoria Beckham, and there were many references to this book in it so I thought I'd give it a read. I'm sorry, but emerging from one of the most successful bands in pop history has given Mrs. Beckham an over inflated ego and a bank balance to match. All the photographs of her and David at awards ceremonies and red carpet events... notice how she even positions their pose? There's nothing natural about her, she's a phoney, and this is coming from one of her previously biggest fans.  I did not take one look at her and decide I hated her. That's not me. I used to think she was great "Wow, Posh Spice, look what she's done for herself! She's got it made!" HOWEVER, over the years she has increasingly changed my opinion of her for the worst. She is pretentious and self-richeous. Oh yes, so she loves her children, she's the greatest mother in the world, blaa blaa blaa... how dare people say Katie Price is an awful mother and then in the same breath preceed to praise Victoria Beckham. Katie Price is an amazing mother, devoting such love and affection to Harvey, whereas Victoria has always seemed slightly too self-obsessed to devote love to them solely - she appears to love herself just as much. I often see pictures of 'Beckham Family Holidays' in gossip papers, and the reporters say "David and Victoria enjoying a holiday with their children", "Devoted parents Victoria and David holiday in the sun with children" - doesn't anybody LOOK at the photos? It's always David and the kids, whilst Victoria suns herself or jokes with a companion. She's never spotted out and about with them unless David's there, she has a nanny to look after them. And what does she do all day? Shop. Or try to get her failed career off the ground. (This is one of Katie Price's strong points - she has always been there for her son).  I'm not saying she's a bad mother - her children probably love her to death - she's just so fake, and this book proves that. Victoria un-neccesarily credits herself in this book (saying, for example, she re-wrote 'Out Of You Mind' when True Steppers have gone on record saying she only added one word to the chorus), makes unkind remarks about former friends (Her first fiance's ring was cheap because it only cost £2,000... whatever Victoria)... I'm afraid I don't have time for her. There's more name dropping in this book than in any other autobiography I've ever read. Read it if you will 
 This tastes more like a chemist's concoction than Peas Paneer. If this is somebody's first acquaintance with Indian cuisine, they would avoid Indian cuisine for the rest of their life.    
 Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean. If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all.......................... 
    At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, "The Road to Serfdom."  Orwell wrote the review in the "Observer," London April 9,1944.    Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, "The Constitution of Liberty" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, "Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to "The Road to Serfdom."  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.       While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him?       "The Constitution of Liberty" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about "liberty" which requires the "rule of Law" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.       Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While "The Constitution of Liberty" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek's other works, "The Road to Serfdom" and his last published volume, "Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell.    Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.      
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 I sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking "opera".  I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work.  The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development.  Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect.  Listen to the sample track "Ice Demons" for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition.  While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion.  In my opinion, some minimalist works like "Einstein on the Beach" by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously.  Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 While I think Ms. Burke has real talent, this book left me cold.  Despite all the other very positive reviews, I found the ongoing "back-stories" confusing and hard to follow.  Our "heroine", Irene Kelly, doesn't even appear until page 149!  And there are just too many characters, and too many family relationships to keep straight.  Not to mention too many references to other plot-lines not being explained in this book.  Perhaps this book should have been separated into two, or even three, stand-alone books.  I think "Bloodlines" would  have benefited enormously from more capable editing 
 Gore Vidal is not without talent as a writer, but whatever ability he possesses is sadly misplaced when he tries to do political analysis.  Somehow, his take on the real world ends up looking and sounding like a fantastical plot from a cheap novel.  No, that's not quite right, because Vidal is too conspiratorial to make a good plot for even Ian Fleming's most outlandish villain.  When did Vidal become incapable of simple common sense?  Does he perhaps partake in chemicals?  That might explain the hallucinogenic nature of "Dreaming War", including the psychodelic title.  In "Dreaming War", Vidal imagines conspiracies so ridiculously complex and intricate that they make even the semi-serious Illuminati drivel from the nineties seem plausible by comparison.  Vidal does poor research, badly documents what he does, and then draws conclusions not supported by even the molecule-thin evidence he bothered to produce.  But then, why sweat the details when you're just in it for a quick payday from anti-capitalist sycophants who will buy into anything that might help them to see the USA (and especially our evil military) humbled and free markets destroyed.    And lest I forget, Vidal must ever continue to feed into his cult of personality so his followers will stroke his ego in all the right ways.  Sadly, none of them have the nerve to tell Emperor Vidal that his shaky logic is naked for all to see.  But in the end, who cares?  I say let the Vidalians continue to wallow in their own little la-la land along with their elitist liberal buddies. I live in the real world where none of his rantings are valid anyway.    By the way, in the real world, western civilization is worth saving from Wahabbist lunatics who would gladly behead even Gore Vidal if given half the chance.  In that sense, Vidal is just another anti-American kook who supports a position that if successful, would only serve to bring about his own death, like the rest of the anti-war movement.    What part of "survival of the fittest" don't they understand?  For an analysis of the illogic of Vidal's position (and that of silly people like him), I direct you to UNHOLY ALLIANCE: RADICAL ISLAM AND THE AMERICAN LEFT by David Horowitz 
 The concept behind this toy is great, but the engineering/design is not.  Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured.  Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours.  We've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth.  The music is HORRIBLY loud.  We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room.  Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch.  This one desperately needs one!!    On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute.  He will chase the balls when they go flying.  He's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out, but he'll get there.  He'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music 
 This just furthers my argument even more. Just because an album is more than 10 years old by a "legendary" group doesn'tmean that it's good or even a classic. This is classh** at its finest. I actually owned this album at one point when I was young and stupid. But i wasn't that stupid cause I got rid of it quick. You mean to tell me this album is derived from true creativity from ones heart. Lyrics that mean somethin. Thats what hip hop is all about and this is not a hip hop album. There is nothin creative about this album at all. Its a dance album for freaks. Now if you lookin at this from that point of view, then I guess this is a 5 star album. But for someone to call this a hip hop classic you have no idea what a hip hop classic is. You just don't. Damn can the state of hip hop be so f***ed up when anything by 2 LIve Crew can be considered worth owning, let alone being called a classic? If you give this 5 stars,then trash garbage rappers the likes of Chingy, Nelly, Trina, Khia, Camron, DFB, D4L. then your the biggest hypocrite typing reviews on amazon. 2 Live Crew in my opinion, lyrically is in the top 5 of the worst rappers in history. And they are just as one dimensional as your most hated rapper. If you don't believe me just scope out ALL their album covers and song titles. And ask yourself can you really call these bums artist. Seriously I cant get it through my head why somebody over the age of 18 would actually by this s***. I just cant 
 I bougt this camera and a Olymus camera, both in the same price range, the Kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. Avoid this at all cost the Olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use 
 Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.  London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.  Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.  This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been. 
 The writeup is incorrect.  This does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers, it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200.  While returning it is not difficult through Amazon, it means a trip to UPS and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement 
 Many Many sections and tables of the 2005 NEC are missing from this tab set.  If you think you are going to get a full set, you are not.  The printing on the bottom of the set reads:  Construction Book Express 
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. When I read the back cover it seemed as if the book was going to be very interesting. However, it was disappointing. The author uses a strange style that actually makes the book difficult to read. That alone would not be so bad if the plot was good, but it isn't. I finished the book expecting something interesting to happen, nothing ever did. This is a boring book, and a real disappointment 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 "I really take Nietzsche to town"--this is a quote from Marilynne Robinson. I heard her say this once at a writer's workshop in Saratoga Springs shortly before this collection, The Death of Adam, was printed. Who would SAY such a thing? It's not that one cannot argue with Nietzsche's thought--but "take him to town"? One may recall Rush Limbaugh, for instance, who, whenever he is under fire for getting someone angry, responds, "That's because I'M RIGHT."   Her book never gets much more intelligent than her quote.   The reviewer who said Robinson has an axe to grind here was right! These essays are well written but often full of a grudging and largely uninformed conservative viewpoint. Like many books that espouse such views, this one seems to see itself as some kind of enlightening  alternative to the "accepted" wisdom about contemporary science and morality. Bosh!     This book was written out of sheer discomfort. Robinson doesn't seem to have given writers such as Darwin and Nietzsche the kind of reading they deserve--that is, the type in which the reader does not immediately discount all ideas that seem like they will lead to undesirable consequences (Nietzsche and Darwin led to Hitler, that kind of tiresome cliche). Come now Marilynne, didn't we get enough of that kind of thing listening to the frat boys argue with the professor in Humanities Seminar back in freshman year? For one who sets out to undermine accepted wisdom, Robinson espouses it in ludicrous amounts.    If you don't happen to agree with Robinson already, most of her thinking will jump out as the usual smokescreen behind which essentially conservative thinkers carry out their specious assault on everything that makes them uncomfortable. 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 I mean, really.  SHARP OBJECTS has gotten tons of media coverage and nary a negative review in sight.  I usually read hundreds of novels a year, and I really don't get the big deal about this novel at all.  This book contains some sharply written prose, but the mystery plotline is quite weak.  SHARP OBJECTS is essentially a literary novel that the publisher has labeled a "mystery" to push more copies on unsuspecting consumers.  This slow-paced novel is not much of a whodunit and contains almost no suspense.  This novel does have a big plot twist near the end, but I found it to be implausable and pointless, tacked on for shock value and nothing more.    My major problem with this novel is the characters.  All of the major players in SHARP OBJECTS are cartoonishly nasty and dysfunctional.  Most of the characters are the residents of a small town in Missouri, and Gillian Flynn seems to have nothing but contempt for most of them.  The heroine of this book is an introspective bore, and possesses little personality beyond her self-destructive behavior.  I didn't like or identify with anyone in SHARP OBJECTS, which for me is a fatal problem with any novel.  I found this book tough to finish.   As Stephen King notes in his blurb, this is a nasty little novel.  The main question is whether you want to waste your time and money on something like this.  In the end, I regretted doing so.   
 Looking for suggestions on creativity and getting started wtih the basics of writing I ordered this book. After the first 50 or so pages I didn't even finish it. I found it formulaic and while some of the ideas were quite interesting I didn't find it nearly as helpful as Steven King's "On Writing" 
 [the above is an actual quote from the book]  I don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library.  I thought: Thriller.  Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.  And the beginning was promising.  Stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.  Then the plot hit the fan!  As a thriller it stunk.  The highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought.  The romantic "tension" between the protagonists was forced and irritating.  The dialogue is mundane.  The message that horniness leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish.  The only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.  The historic (WWII) componant was interesting.  But overall, I kept asking who the audience is for this book.  Not lovers of thrillers like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves him! 
 These stories are all about women in various traveling situations. I expected more of them to be funny, but hardly any were. Some of them were downright stupid, actually. Quite a few locations were covered, but many of them didn't really give me a good sense of place. I didn't think this was a good book, travel or not 
 Very hard to read and understand. Each chapter has Learning Objectives and those LO's are referenced for the questions at the end. The problem is: inside the chapter there is no way to find out what the LO's are!!! Me and a friend tried to figure it out but it was almost impossible. A lot of the chapter questions were very difficult. Several spelling errors that a sixth grader could have found. I had a Managerial Accounting class twice, once as a prerequisite for my graduate degree and I am taking it now for my MBA. Imagine my horror when I discovered that I was using this same book twice. I hope you never get stuck with this turkey of a book 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 A bit of a disappointment. Anecdotal and reflective, but not really informative about how the process of creativity works. A little bit scholarly and pedantic 
 This poorly written and researched book is typical of the "hype" that is continually fed to the American public -- EVERYTHING is a crisis! EVERYTHING (from terrorism to the food we eat) is an epidemic! We are bad, and we need to change our behavior -- FAST, or some terrible disaster will befall us.  If you study the history of fads in the US, you find a disturbing trend to demonize food, or to believe that if you eat a certain way (all meat, no meat, vegan, low carbs, no carbs, etc.), then all will be well...you will live forever and your life will be perfect.  There is also an alarming tendency to blame people for their own health problems. It is rare to hear anyone be so heartless and cruel as to blame someone for getting cancer, but just listen to the self-righteous lecturing when author Francine Kaufman blames the overweight for developing diabetes!  I write this as someone who has so much diabetes in her family, that almost every relative of mine has this disease...at least 90%. So I take it very seriously, read everything I can on the illness and try to live as healthy a lifestyle as I can. But -- it's still an illness. My family history shows that it is clearly HEREDITARY, and not entirely due to lifestyle. A number of my family members who became diabetic (Type 2) were NOT obese...some were slightly overweight and others actually slim.   One thing utterly ignored by this poorly researched book is that slim people can and do develope Type II diabetes, especially with age. And that the majority of overweight individuals do NOT have diabetes.  There is obviously a link between Type II diabetes and extra weight, but the most advanced research indicates that diabetes is a far more complex disease than people previously thought....the failure of the bodies complex system of managing carbs and sugars, insulin, etc. begins years before diabetes is diagnosable. I believe, along with many researchers, that it is this long period of insulin surges that causes vulnerable individuals with a genetic pre-disposition to have huge appetites and overeat, thus becoming overweight. The overweight may be a signal that something is indeed wrong metabolically with an individual, and should be managed. However, blaming the patient (i.e., he or she is a "fat pig" and needs to deny themselves every kind of good tasting food, plus do punishing excercise) is wrong and is guaranteed to fail, as is ANY medical diagnosis that is based on blame and moral judgement, instead of science.  The biggest problem fueling the "diabetes" crisis is that 45 million Americans do not have access to health insurance, and therefore, have no medical care of any kind. This means they can't have the checkups, diagnosis, insulin, diabetes monitors, etc. that are essential to treating the disease...hence, their disease goes unchecked until it becomes a life-threatening crisis. This is intolerable in a civilized nation! This is the problem we need to be addressing, not blaming people and trying to shame them for having an illness.  I am heartily sick and tired of this kind of book, which exploits the sick and suffering of human beings, just to sell copies and comes up with "cute" names like "Diabesity" to describe serious medical conditions.  If you are interested in genuine diabetes research on the cutting edge, or having serious concerns about yourself or a family member in this regard, please read some better researched and less commercial books on this subject 
 Does anyone know when the next 'breakthrough' diet book will be released? I just feel so lost without a new 'diet' to try....you know, like one that uses fancy sounding terms to make things sound official and important and even though I have no idea whether it's true of not even after I've read it, it just sounds to complex to be false....or maybe one that will reaffirm many of my current bad eating habits so I don't feel guilty....and hey, if I can loose weight on it....that's a bonus. I haven't found any diet book yet that fits any of the described categories above, but hey, I'm looking.  Thanks for you interest 
 This book was a bit of a disappointment, the text is informative, but the poor black and white images are really quite awful, and not every state capitol comes with an image, which is very odd in a book of this kind..the book feels like a ph.d disertation that was bound into a book, the physical book is quite second rate in quality, though the text is scholarly..could have, should have been better...seriously over priced 
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 If you are looking for a fresh look at some of Broadway's bomb, do not stop here.  Suskind wrote very little in this book of previously-published material by other people.  This book is more accuratly "compiled by" than "by" him.  I refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes (more or less) in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books.  It may be a reference for theatre students, but there isn't much else to recommend this book.  And don't get me wrong; flops are a source of morbid fascination for me.  This is why I am so disappointed with this particlar volume -- there's nothing in it that you can't get in other, better written, better compiled, and better organized tomes 
 I think enough has been said about Troll 2 in the other reviews, but not enough about the first Troll. I saw it when I was 12 and thought it was hilarious and full of weird creatures. Well watching it again with the family 19 years later was pretty tedious.  The plot is rather thin and consists of the fairy world trying to take over this world. This begins by a Troll changing an apartment building one room at a time into a sort of portal. He does this under the guise of a girl he kidnapped at the beginning of the movie. Apparently he was living in the basement of the apartment building since it was built and finally an unescourted blond girl happened down there so he could begin his evil deeds.   I imagine the troll would have had his work cut out for him considering he was the only one with a magic ring. The other goblins that came over would just sit around in the various apartments looking damp and probably wondering how long this would take. I kept wondering WHY they wanted to take over this world. Their's seemed lush and green and wide open. Why do they want to take over a world with pollution and overcrowding? In addition, there's a 400 year old guardian witch living in the building and plenty of plot devices and loopholes to keep you from questioning everything that happens.   I also think it's necessary to mention the not-so-special effects. While it goes without saying that an 80s scary b-movie isn't going to have any amazing effects, by today's standards they really take you out of the movie. My 10 year old daughter (spoiled by Harry Potter and Jurassic Park) lost interest and didn't make it to the end. My wife rolled her eyes and grunted in plenty of scenes. The stop-motion towards the end is pretty horrendous even by 50s standards. I will say the Troll's makeup was pretty good mostly because it was a person and not another of the 101 cheap puppets found in this movie.     
    Yet another attempt by the neo-con sub-class to obfuscate decency, morality, and the truth. Something is profoundly wrong with these people and I consider them to be a danger to this country and the world at large. Read it but be wary 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 In two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds.  Don't waste your money.  The 11$ Sunbeam dial scale is more accurate 
 This took out the package, plugged it in, and got nothing. The power light would not come on. The connection going into the unit seemed to be flimsy. After wiggling the wire around, I got some static on the screen. Finally I got the power to stay on, and tried playing a DVD. It played a few minutes and then froze up. Repeated this 3 times, put it back in the package, and mailed back to Amazon 
 Alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident.  There is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander's strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant. 
 When buying this book, I expected a much deeper insight on the new technology involved in this product. What I found, instead, is a list of wonderful new buttons and taskbars. Is there anything beyond this colorful  new interface ? I am still wondering 
 This must be a joke. Writing yet another book on creativity that is simply a rehash of the original book with a slightly different twist. Not an example of creative thinking in my estimation. Don't waste your money 
 Solutions are sometimes even more abstruse than the problems and concepts themselves.  Someone got lazy writing out these solutions!  Plus, more than half the problems are not solved in this book.  Not worth $34 in my opinion 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 Perelman catalogs a litany of injustices (perceived and real) associated with intellectual property. The injustices themselves are fairly interesting, but Perelman's analysis is shrill and unashamedly biased - every case builds into his thesis that intellectual property is evil and must be replaced...  But this is the biggest problem with the book - 150 pages of criticism of the system that builds to a crescendo of NOTHING. At the end of the book he reveals that he doesn't have any idea of how the system could be improved or what it could be replaced with; even an implausible or unworkable suggestion would be better than none at all.  In the end I was left disappointed but not altogether unsurprised 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 This is a required book for an introductory lighting class I'm taking.  Since we are solely relying on this book and it isn't supplemented with lecture material, I find that, without familiarity with lighting terminology and concepts, it is very difficult to understand -- very cryptic with the seemingly overused language of the field.  While the author may be very knowledgeable, I feel the book is not very well written and the target audience is, perhaps, not intended to be, essentially, the layman.  I don't find the organization of ideas and concepts to be clearly laid out or communicated well and, as they unfold, and I come to understand what the author is trying to say,  wonder why it was made so difficult -- is that all he means, geesh and why didn't he tell me that earlier.  It would be easier to understand the general concept of things first, even in plain English perhaps, and then go on to a more technical description to learn the language of the field and get the details.  Just seems to make simple things very complicated, especially with the language, flow of ideas, and phrasing.    I also find a lot of the graphic figures and photo examples need some clarification or more details.  A picture's supposed to be worth a thousand words, not be cryptic and time-consuming to understand.    Sorry, I would not recommend this for students who are not primed first.  Especially the younger ones.    
 I don't remember where I saw it, but I caught a reference to this book, 334 : A Novel by Thomas M. Disch.  It sounded interesting...  A futuristic look at life in this particular government-controlled housing unit.  After finishing it, all I can say is "why?"...  The book is a series of vignettes that follow a group of people who live in this government housing complex.  It's sometime around 2020 to 2025, and the stories jump back and forth over that timeframe.  The best I can do is describe this as "reality novel-reading" (as opposed to reality television), and I don't like either, I guess.  The stories were pointless, the writing attempted to be philosophical and deep (and it was totally wasted on me), and I never really got caught up in any of the characters or in what was going on.  It sort of reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction in the way that the timeline of events was completely out of sequence with what you were seeing.  The end of the movie is the start of the movie from a different angle...  That sort of strange stuff.    Perhaps I'm just not "sophisticated" enough for this book, but in my opinion it was a waste of time and paper...  The only thing it had going for it was that it was fairly short.. 
 The worst story is Kenyon !!! I will NOT buy any more in the future!! 
 Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.     Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.     "Diabolique" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, "Diabolique" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.   
 I was hoping for a yoga book with pictures that allows me easy and safe postures -- maybe modified -- of the standard beginner yoga. Instead I got pictures - a book full of them -- of people lying on the floor on their backs sleeping. Waste of a book 
 As you see, there are reviews giving this book both good and bad reviews - the good ones praise its organization and readability, the bad ones point out its errors. There are indeed a fair number of errors, which is bad enough, but I found many explanations confusing and misleading - perhaps because I have 3 years experience with security, and 15 with networking. Organization is all very well, but to make an analogy, a well-written tour guide to Denmark is of little help in finding your way in France! Skip this one!! 
 From the back cover:  Miracles do happen!  Award-winning actress Mary Steenburgen (TV's JOAN OF ARCADIA, HOPE SPRINGS) gives a solid performance as Ginny Grainger, a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of Christmas, thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six-year-old daughter Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois) and Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), Ginny's very own guardian angel. Ginny's wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past Disney favorites. ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS fulfills all your most treasured Christmas fantasies. Share it with those you love.  And my review:  I'm such a sucker for Christmas stuff. I probably own more Christmas books and movies than regular ones. So this review is not from a "Bah Humbug!" Scrooge. And I don't expect all of my Christmas films to be "happy happy joy joy" all of the time. My absolute favorite of all time is IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which can be very dark in places.  First off, I don't think that the acting was bad in this movie. And the cinematography was pretty good as well. I made my judgment based on the content and the storyline, which, in my opinion, flopped.  What I really found annoying was the way Ginny, the heroine, was constantly being villified. For example, let me paint you a picture of her life: her husband was laid off and hasn't worked in six months. They have two young children. She's making minimum wage, and they're barely scraping by. They've also been evicted from their home (since it's owned by her husband's previous employer) and are forced to move in with her father-in-law. They have very little saved in the bank, and yet her husband wants to take out $500 to buy Christmas presents for the kids. She understandably balks at the idea. First of all $500 is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids, even if you're rich. Unless you want your kids to become spoiled! (Remember, this movie was originally made in 1985, so that number is even more outrageous. Plus, they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own. I think that she's being reasonable. But she's painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys.  Then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop, and possibly go into debt to own his own business. Again, she's villified for being the only responsible one, and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck. After all, they may need their savings to survive. This is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out (and usually don't, since most small businesses fail in the first year). But no, she's shown to be a mean, cold-hearted witch for saying this. Grr. It was just so irritating. Yes, you want to give your kids a magical Christmas, yes, the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop, but you have to be responsible, especially when you have children to feed the clothe. I don't think she was being a Scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult (she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts, after all), but the film painted her as such.  And this film was so depressing. It felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down. The happy ending was a long time in coming.  Also, I'd be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children. I certainly wouldn't want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me, run away from home in the middle of the night, or talk to creepy-looking strangers in trench coats. That's how kids end up abducted or killed! Not really realistic.  I really expected better from Disney, especially when I really loved one of their other Christmas movies, THE SANTA CLAUSE. There are way better Christmas movies out there. See my list "Christmas movies that I watch every year" for movies that are worth your time and money. I don't recommend ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS. If you're still determined to watch it, try to rent it first, or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money, like I was. 
 If you're going to release an album called Rick Springfield's Greatest Hits, how do you omit his greatest hit?  "Honeymoon in Beirut" is by far the best song the guy did --   It's like when people talk about the Police's Synchronicity album and they say "Every Breath You Take" is the best song --   Hello? "Tea in the Sahara" is the song that exemplifies what that album was about.........anyway.........  Rick had a lot of great songs, but to leave out his best one and put some of the clunkers that are on this album is inexcusable.  
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IT POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS   T. LUCA 
 Used for my Measurement & Evaluation class for my MSEd. program, I've already convinced the professor to find a new book for his next group of students.  The book has inadequate explanations - all too open ended for my taste, dry writing, and   hard to decipher language.  It says so much, while saying nothing at all!  As if the field of assessment and testing wasn't dry enough, along comes Linn, ready to make it even worse.  There has got to be a better book!  Needless to say, I relied on the i-net for supplementary information to our class lectures.  I did not crack this book once beyond the intro chapter 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 As an amateur cello player, who picked up an instrument for the first time  3 years ago, I looked to this book for inspiration and enlightenment.  It  is represented as an amateur exploration of music, the discovery of real  music later in life.  Fact in point, the author is an amateur only in the  sense that he does not tour or get paid to play his instrument.  However we  quickly learn that this author has been playing one instrument or another  since childhood, and could at one point almost have made it as a  clarinetist.  This book quickly turns into a "dig me" diatribe  which left me in disagreement with the author:  despite his best efforts, I  was not ultimately convinced that he was a "cool guy" -- which is  really all he's trying to communicate.  For my purposes, this book was  unmitigated tripe 
 I read Shamdasani's book together with the two books by Richard Noll. When you compare the books, it is clear that Noll's scholarship is thorough, devestating to Jung, and convincing. Shamdasani's book, which at 144 pages  is actually more of a pamphlet, is a strange, mean-spirited, attack on Noll  that borders on the personal. It is an odd book that seems to have been  written in a jealous rage. Obviously Noll is the more talented scholar, and  Shamdasani wastes his arguments on trying to undermine Noll without  offering anything new and convincing. It is not surprising that this book  has not been reviewed by serious publications, as Noll's have. Thank  goodness I did not buy this book, but read it in one long sitting in the  cafe at Borders. Shamdasani's book is a waste of time and money. Don't buy  it 
 If you were an Alan Parsons Project fan back in the 70's and 80's, the only thing you will NOT find in this 2 cd set is the original APP music. I bought this set today from a shopping mall and could hardly wait until i go to my car and put the cd in the car stereo. First track is "I Robot" (enstrumental), its so changed that i couldnt even recognize it.  90% of the songs are NOT the originals i used to love back in the 70's.  This is CHEAP ELEVATOR MUSIC. This can be anything but definately not Alan Parsons. I feel so cheated that first thing in the morning i will be returning it. And i will never buy a new APP cd again. Shame on you APP. I guess other reviewers either only wrote their comments by looking at the track listing or they are so young that they dont know the original APP music. If you love APP dont buy this set 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
  if you are an advanced cardplayer take a pass on this book,this book is basic Common Sense and thats it..   just another C grade pro trying to cash in.  
 this dvd will not play at all.  i contacted amazon and haven't received a response.  i will say this is the very first problem i have had with them in all the years i have been ordering.  
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 Considering Nora Roberts' reputation and clout, you would think she'd insist on only the best as a narrator.  To begin with, this is the third book, but the first two were narrated by someone else, so there's no consistency.  The narrator of the first two books, David Stuart, was ok, but this person, Guy Lemonier, STINKS!  He seems to be merely reading the story out loud.  There is no differentiation between characters, making dialogue hard to follow, and considering he's narrating on behalf of a character, Phillip, who is supposedly the son of a doctor, I find it ludicrous that he doesn't know how to pronounce words like Imitrex (a medication).  Also, all three books are abridged to the extent that many of the funnier moments are omitted, and all the dialogue with Ray and Stella as ghosts is not included.  Don't waste your money on the CD version 
 The remix sucks.  DOn't even buy the whole remixes on iTunes, they really are bad.  I will write reviews for their other remixes.  Nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment.  The title is the NATO Phoetic alphabet, your stupid piece of _____.  Once again, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Becuase your stupid.  Tell me, could you write a song like this?    Your respone will be:  No, but It's stupid anyway! or, YES!  No, no you couldn't.  _____ off, your reasons on your pathetic reivew for Hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are.  THe people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the BHG haters are 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 I expected more from the first true book I've read about this type of phenomena. The book should have been a third of its 398 pages, because in the end, all you have is a couple of people's stories, however compelling they are, to judge for their truthfulness.  The three cental figures connected to the Linda Cortile case won't reveal themselves, so we're left wondering if she made them up(by sending letters to the author) to further her sensational means.  There isn't any real evidence other than a xray that used to show an object in Mrs. Cortile's nose, which is no longer there, well, because the aliens took it out.  Hopkins conviction and analysis is compelling, as well as some interesting side stories.  But in the end, even if the events did take place, which is possible, what happened is kinda silly.  With obsessed top security agents, a wierd "world leader", and criss-crossing generational alien meetings, this should have preferably been a 30 page article 
 At least for my Sony DVD burner in my Powermac.  Completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
    If you're considering buying this book, I want to look down at the bottom of this page and note the number of customer reviews.  Everything, I'm going to say has already probably been said by them, but I will continue on out of ego.  What drove so many people to their keyboards? Simply, rage.  I know that's the case with me anyways, dear readers.  I wasted an entire summer on these books hoping desperately that their former glory would somehow blaze back into life.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  Reading these novels now is just like drinking microwaved coffee.     I'm sure Jordan has never read Hemingway.  The former may look like the latter, but old rough and tough Ernest wouldn't waste time describing dresses when, I don't know, he could be instilling artistic value into the prose.  What about Jordans characterizations, though, you ask?  (You're probably not asking that,but just go along with it.)  Well, and this may be shocking, Jordan's world happens to be filled by personality dopplegangers.  It's as if every woman's genetic code was locked into the same sequence for all eternity.  Oh, sure they may look different (it's mostly because of the dresses, I think), but they all possess the exact same persona that is, basically, Jordan's botched attempt at a strong woman.  I cannot take another exclamation of "Men!"  I guess that's some sort of mantra that let's you know they're REAL strong women.  It must be far more effective than actually instilling them with depth of character and the ability to triumph in adverse circumstances.  Then there are his male characters, who are either jerks or, in Perrin's case, lesser jerks who you hate anyways.    But, the most greivous sin Jordan committs here is the utter stagnation of the plot.  Nothing happens.  Most of its an intricate dance of braid pulling and smoothing of skirts.  Rand is barely in it.  Which, doesn't really matter, it's not as if he's been doing anything great for the past couple books.  Tuon is terribly uninteresting, because, well, I've seen her many times before.  She's just part of Jordan's mad scheme to make sure every character's paired up and in everlasting love.  Which brings me to a point.  Why must Rand have three girlfriends?  If that is not the most teenage boy-oriented plot device ever employed.  And guess what, ones blonde, ones a rehead, and the other's a brunette.  Just thinking about it makes me want to cast down modern literature.                      Run from this novel 
 i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg. 
 This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary! 
 This book is for couples who ARE having fertility problems. If you are just trying to get pregnant and haven't been diagnosed with a problem I wouldn't read this book. It is full of medical info and what to talk to your doctor about 
 This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing 
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.    Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.    To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE 
 This 1009-paged law school casebook is more like an anthology, wherein the collected works overlap with redundant content.  Having read the book twice now, cover-to-cover, it has become clear that the authors are more concerned about proving themselves to the legal community than writing a student-oriented casebook.  Contributing to the repetitiveness seems to be the authors' knack for turning simple concepts into entire chapter sections all the while managing to continue a self-important attitude.  Indeed, the arrogance is displayed throughout.  An often repeated phrase is "one of the authors of this case book..."  Meanwhile, the authors add full law review articles that contribute little to the subject matter.  Fortunately, the authors do give credit where credit is due by citing in bold the authors of those articles-themselves.  All of this and more makes for a poor read.  Suffice to say, the authors on this book know little about the meaning of being concise.  Readers are fortunate that they did manage to cut 361 pages from their prior edition.  One author recently stated that the next edition will be a full 400 pages shorter, which gives one an idea of the present, unnecessary content.  This casebook series is simply in too desperate need of an objective editor to be educational.  I strongly recommend that professors, students, and casual readers alike look to other sources of information, such as the equally-priced University Casebook Series 
 This book was boring; it was a chore to finish. It takes place in Glamorous Hollywood, a bit too glamorous for me. The main character, a lawyer, has a boyfriend she's not too happy with. This book has too many boring pages. This is definitely the last book by this author that I will ever read 
 Despite the remastering, the first three songs on this CD are apparently still reproduced in mono.  When heard through headphones, the vocal and some of the music comes out though the right speaker and the rest of the music comes out through the left speaker.  No vocal is heard through the left speaker.  I owned this collection before it was remastered and I don't recall this happening.  I also own the two disc Hollies Greatest Hits collection and this does not occur on either of those discs.  On the two disc set, the vocal comes out through both speakers.  Somebody messed up!  
 This is by far one of the worst books on programming or game design that I have ever read.  The book is written out of order, incomplete, ambiguous, and shallow in the explanations of code.  To give an excellent example, chapter 5 has you code several modules for client and server based actions but the game won't run with just the files the book tells you to create.  The end of chapter 5 even mentions the AI beast running around; what AI beasts I never typed in a module to control AI?  I even checked the code on the CD against the book and there were inconsistencies, I am not going to debug the script to see what the difference is but I can tell you just by glancing through it there were a few problems. Also the fact that we are jumping around in the book concerns me too since each chapter builds on the one before it except it seems GUIs are not till chapter 10 but are used in the game in chapter 5 and that the book stops creating the game at chapter 7, starts focusing on integrating other programs, and picks up at chapter 18 with weather. 
 The order was delivered promptly the price was fair, but the item was defective it did not work at all. The return process also was easy and I did get a prompt return of my money 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 I am an avid fan of "As Time Goes By" and i was dissapointed when i got the  "You Must Remember This" VHS. I felted betrayed that it included scenes from episodes that are hard to find available to purchase.  So the story wasn't really complete for me.  I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the producer's time would have been better spent by doing more seasons. Another thing i have to admit was weird, was that there was no laugh track, it was just silence after the jokes, i'm just use to having it. i would like to get the episodes i missed, to complete the story, esp the love story between Alistair and Judy. Oh well 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 For those of you out there who adore Anna May Wong (and there seem to be quite a few), or have an interest in early 20th century British musicals (!?), this should be a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  I'm neither, however, so I found it pretty tough going.  Neither the material nor the acting is particularly distinguished, and the "direction" is non-existent.  (This is one of those films that looks almost entirely made up of first takes.)  It may be a bit harsh to judge "Chu Chin Chow" by today's standards, but this WAS the era of Astaire & Rodgers, the Broadway Melody films and countless other wonderful movie musicals.  Perhaps the British film industry was less interested in financing this type of thing.  There seems to be some discrepancy amongst reviewers as to the quality of the DVD transfer.  I'm on the side of pretty awful.  I'm not sure why any distributor would go to the trouble of issuing a deluxe 3-disc (!) set of an obscure film curiosity without doing a better job of cleaning it up.  And the soundtrack is hopelessly compromised, particularly during songs, the lyrics of which fly by unintelligably.  (Subtitles would have helped a lot, but sadly they don't exist.)  All in all "Chu Chin Cow is a must see...but only if you must 
 This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled 
 I Netflixed this and was surprised at the results. Cybil Sheppard was likable, but Bruce Willis, the one for whom I thought I'd like the show FOR is abrasive (not "fun" abrasive) and generally hammy. I could not like the show because I could NOT like his character. Worse still, the chemistry between the two is simply cold and awkward. Totally lacking the spirit and warmth of Remington Steele and Miss Laura Holt. The humor is grating and sometimes embarrassing.  For some reason certain shows just seem stuck in the time period they arrived in and Moonlighting is by far one of the, uh, stuckiest. The sound cues feel like they were yanked from Terminator One (not a good thing).   There is a brief interview section on Disc One where they brazingly put down other shows of the time period and gloat on how they created something "different." If cold, dated, and impersonal is "different" than I guess they did. I would wager many here who give this 5 stars viewed it in its original time frame and have been fans all along, though I must say looking at this from the outside, it is quite honestly, a train-wreck. I have a feeling the show "could" get better but I won't be around to reset the tracks 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 Just read Podur's review after seeing link below.  He also wrote "Although he [Deibert] tries to tiptoe round the record of Latortue and his foreign backers, Deibert sets clear pointers as to the major culprit. `Aristide had not run out of cards to play' he writes of a clash on 7 March 2004, a week after the invasion, when the ousted president was being shuttled, a virtual hostage, between African airports. A joint PNH-MINUSTAH assault on a Lavalas demonstration in September 2004 is described as `an explosion of violence by Aristide partisans'; Deibert uncritically reproduces the Latortue government's unsubstantiated--and scarcely credible--assertion that `Aristide's financial and moral support of the rebellion from South Africa' was to blame for the deaths that ensued."   Someone should also mention that Deibert has supported the Latortue dictatorship  at every turn.  No wonder that apologists for imperialism such as Michael Shifter would write a glowing review.  Shifter's Inter American Dialouge is in part funded by the World Bank which has long been after a privatiztion of Haiti's public assets!  What the hell was seven stories press thinking???  
 My husband and I saw the commercials for the Moon Sand products and got very excited because our daughter loves to play in her sand box when the weather is warm. We thought it would be fun to play with it indoors when it's cold outside. What a mistake! We bought the farm set and the castle set and just threw them both in the garbage this morning. In all fairness, the consistency of the product is pretty cool but there's not much of it. It's kind of like a cross between sand and playdoh or clay. That's also part of the problem. It will stick together when you mold it but unlike playdoh it is very fragile and comes apart easily, getting scattered EVERYWHERE, sticking to EVERYTHING. It's in our carpet, on the kid's clothes, in my tile grout, and I'm sure some other places I've yet to discover. The included molds are nearly impossible for a child to use and the sand gets stuck in all of the nooks and crannies. I had to use an old toothbrush to get all of the sand out of them.  After using this product I have a new found appreciation for playdoh. It may get hard after awhile, but it is cheap, clean, and consistently reliable. 
 Calvino's category of novels haunting the Reader at the beginning of "If On a Winter's Night a Traveller" clearly corresponds to Andrea Lee's Italian story. As usual, Italy is the country of sensual sin, no matter what. As usual, the young Harvard female graduate (presumably intelligent and exposed to different cultures and possibly some feminist thought) will fall not just for muscles, but for money and attitude and yield to the Italian Master: not a renaissance intellectual, but some sort of moderately well-read Berlusconey who knows how not to spare the rod with women... as usual... Opposite to him, as usual, the well-rounded New Englander who had at least the courage to step out of his family's tradition is the Gullible One, thoroughly emasculated by his own Political Correctness. (How could Philip Roth not be enamoured with this novel? How could he not fall for Zenin, the Italo-financial version of Coleman Silk -- i.e. what Silk would love to be -- who may not even need to take Viagra, since money and power are well known natural aphrodisiacs?) As usual, no good deed goes unpunished. As usual, after a trip to the local public library and given some of my time, I will at least save my money on it 
 Start off with the bad news.  I have a Motorola DVR / Converter box with my Comcast cable service, and the Comcast remote sends the ADS box into gonzo fits.  Attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ADS box to switch inputs.  Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc.  I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time.   Obviously, this is not acceptable.  Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling.  Tivo, analog cable, DVD, Laserdisc all look better.  The improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle, but definitely not worth it if you have a Motorola cable box that will conflict.  5 stars for video quality, 3 stars for user interface (which is not so great), subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict.  
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 Conventional Lampworking generally refers to soft glass, but this book deals with borosilicate or "hard Glass".  Since I wanted a book on soft glass "moretti" I was extremely disappointed 
 With such an ambitious title, I expected a more lively and fulfilling  work.  Instead, I was left waiting for Moore to take ideas to a greater  spiritual and intellectual level; unfortunately, this never happened.  For  those who want more substance, I suggest looking elsewhere 
 This book reminds me of a sentence I saw in Time Magazine several years ago from Bono of U2. "To me, writing a song is easy. Writing a good song is not."   The authors had given a good eg of the above and showed how to write and sell a trading book with the least effort.   First, create an eye catching name. "The inner game of trading" certainly qualifies. It is the best part of the book, in my opinion.  Second, talk about trading psychology. Ask readers whether they have goals, plans, strategies, the right motive (money should never be the first priority, they said) before any trade. Ask them to model themselves after successful traders to have edges in discipline, focus, knowledge...If you dont follow these and you dont know how to answer the questions, that's your fault. (Should the readers have a degree in psychology before reading this book so that they can condition themselves psychologically just by reading less than 10 pages of 1.5 line spacing script and undergoing serious personality change). 50 pages  Third, interviews with some famous names or at least figure heads from CME, so other members of the Exchange will do the recommendation and referral. They had Leo Melamed, who to me is a diplomat or CEO much and not a trader. 60 pages  Fourth, put some intelligent sayings, relevant or not, here and there. Appeal to experts, for the name of Thomas Edison and President Lincoln, can heighten trustworthiness.    Fifth, show charts and graphs, talk about technical analysis so that everything looks more scientific. 40 pages  Sixth, conclude that if readers can cut loss short, let profit ride, discipline themselves then they will be winners. The authors had not told you how but they had done their part. If the reader fails, it's just that he/she does not follow the teachings or lessons good enough. 30 pages  I am sorry to say so but I have to conclude that the authors just want cash in on their dubious trading knowledge (being in the trade is different from trading successfully), relation with institutions and the urge of market participants for trading advice. Certainly, writing a book can help the promotion of their daily business.   To save the best for last, the authors said that over 80% of market participants are losers and the turnover rate in CME had been 1/3 per annum. If you would like to belong to the crowd, buy and hold on to this book 
 I thought this video was a Cesar Milan Dog Whisperer video.  I was linked to it by the Amazon suggestions on the Cesar Milan book page.  Very disappointing 
 The book felt like hype for Pip Coburn's investments. It contradicts itself in numerous places and its examples are sketchy on details and facts. For instance, cost is rarely even a factor and that's the magic of the "change function", but in chapter 4 it seems to be a significant factor in the failure of Iridium/Globalstar. His hyping of satellite radio was very one sided. He mentioned none of the reasons many investors already consider it a failure- if you want customized music just buy an ipod, the most important 20-30 year old demographic can't afford brand new cars with XM and have a "free music" mentality, and the infrastructure costs with satellites combined with still needing ground antennas makes it uncompetitively expensive. Intel did not give up on MHz increases because customers did not care. They gave up because they are hitting technology limitations as silicon approaches the limits that physics will allow. Salesforce.com is mentioned practically in every chapter as a godsend example of a great company, yet I can easily apply Coburn style methods to counter this enthusiasm. My biggest disappointment was this one sided analysis throughout the whole book 
 This dock was a waste for me.  It came with the Home AV Pack.  I wanted a durable zune case that would look good and protect the screen at the same time. The Toughskin case does all three and is EXACTLY what I was looking for protection. The only down side to the Toughskin case is that the zune will not fit in this docking station while it is in the case. I believe that is an engineering problem of the docking station. This is NOT a bulky case, it fits the zune perfectly, however, even with removing the insert of the docking station, the zune does not fit the dock while in the case. Why they didn't make a docking station that would accommodate a zune in a fitted case, makes no sense. No one is going to want to take the trouble of removing a case each time they dock their zune. They should take these docking stations back from customers who feel as I do and replace them at THEIR expense with something that works! As for the Toughskin case, I highly recommend it; the other cases just didn't seem to offer this quality of protection while also having a nice professional appearance. 
 I read the other reviews of this book and thought that it sounded good for a tarot beginner like myself.  However, none of the reviews mentioned the extremely shallow interpretations of the cards or the book's Christian bias.  I only made it about halfway through the book before I gave up in despair.  The interpretations of the individual cards are incredibly simplistic and do little more than describe what is pictured on them.  There is no deeper spiritual interpretation; instead, one gets a "fortune-teller's" prediction of what the card portends for the querent's future.  The book reeks of the new-age crystal-waving flavor of occultism, which is little more than Christianity without the fire and brimstone.  The author's philosophy is obviously that "base", materialistic urges (like the sex drive) are bad, and "pure", watered-down "love" and asceticism are the only path to spiritual development.  The author's interpretations of the devil and the fish as symbols make her view blatantly clear.  I am an absolute beginner at Qabalah; nevertheless, the few Qabalistic references in the first half of the book make it obvious that the author knows even less than I do.  I shudder to think that this book has an entire chapter on it, as well as on runes, chakras and other topics that the author undoubtedly is just as ignorant about.  The moral of the story?  If you enjoy the many flaky, saccharine, under-researched occult books on the market today, you will certainly like this book.  However, if you are seriously trying to use the tarot as a tool to develop your spirituality, stay away 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 It's one thing to have influences, it's another to hopelessly pound out the same music they do... only without panache.  That's "She Wants Revenge".  In fact, even the name hearkens Joy Division (the song, "She's Lost Control").  That would be like having a Ramones sound alike band and calling it "Blitzkrieg Shuffle".  Actually most of their songs seem to be a cut and paste of the Joy Division catalog... and no, I'm not even joking.  You can read the lyric sheets yourself.  What makes this truly deplorable is the 12-year old Jr High bent of their lyrics.  If you listen to all of Joy Divisions catalog, specifically "Unknown Pleasures" then this album, it becomes analog to comparing a Herzog film to the Farelly Brothers.  If you like it, that's fine, but it isn't art and there are somethings some people just don't get.  She Wants Revenge is the personification of that attitude.  I would have to agree with the Onion's review of this album.  But if you're a wannabe hipster, this is probably as cool as you will ever get on your own 
 Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash 
 My child is 2 1/2 years old .  She watched about 10 minutes into the movie and appeared to be quite frightened by some of the images.  The story line appeared to be sensible but not one that a toddler will understand.  At the end of the day I do not think the point of the story is what she remembers as much as she will remember the scarry pirate. 
 First of all, and this is a big deal if you are planning to use this with a handheld mic, there are little lugs on each side of the already oversized and too large rubber XLR surround. This makes it very difficult to get the connector in and out of the mic stand clip, and every time causes the connector to be put under unnecessary stress. I shaved off the two little lugs on the mic end with a pocket knife, making it better but still not as good as a standard Neutrik XLR.  I bought 4 of these, using 2 of them. Within one month, one of them had developed a fault in the connector and was causing that annoying staticy cutting in and out issue. This was from use in my project studio only, not on stage. I have been using professional XLR cables for over 10 years and always take good care of my cables. I used to make my own and they are still holding up after years of touring!!! I thought Monster were supposed to be the best cable around... just clever marketing it seems???  Fortunately they have a lifetime warrently, but I still had to take time to get a Return Auth and pay for shipping back to them. Next time this happens I will just cut the connectors off and solder on a couple of Neutriks. The cable itself appears fine. The badly designed XLRs seem to be the root of the problem with these 
 This film is poorly shot, the sound is terrible, the Pythons look disinterested.  This DVD is TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS.  It needs to be a 9.99 special.    Save your money, buy Holy Grail, Meaning of Life, Life of Brian...etc.  If you really want the sketches from the show...BUY THE SHOW.     Or even better, spend a little more money and buy Fawlty Towers on DVD.  A much better investment and far, far funnier.  
 This desk isn't adequately packaged for shipping.  Just a few pieces of brown paper and styrophome corners with the desk pieces inside the box. The first time the desk was shipped to me, both of the legs were broken and the top had a corner smashed and a gouge in the center.  When Target sent me a replacement desk, that one had broken legs also.  A desk with no legs is worthless.  
 If you are looking to pass time with an author who is gifted in communicating strong emotions, you found your book. If you are hoping to learn about corporate bait and switch or getting a job, this book is void of that.   The book jacket and introduction tells readers the author sets out to get a job, work in corporate America and then write a book about her presumed challenges. Barbara Ehrenreich admits she lied (p.9) to employers about her job history and got friends, with similar values, to support her lies. It didn't work. She never got a job and wrote a book about it anyway. The content basically is a five-page article that Barbara Ehrenreich sold as a 237 page book that is slow paced. Monotonous details are ubiquitous (e.g. itemizing the food in buffet lines and what strangers put on their lunch plates).   If you are discouraged about your job search, don't get this book. It will not lift you up, it will not help you get a job and it has serious potential to put you in a depressing downward spiral. Barbara Ehrenreich is unbalanced against capitalism and corporate America. While it is well known they are not perfect, Barbara Ehrenreich never mentions the positive aspects of capitalism and corporate America. Nor does she give comparative statistics on the amount of people who live well in capitalist economies verses other economies. The book is a constant flow of vocational pessimism.  Although the author uses the first half of the book to set herself up as a well-reasoned, balanced and unprejudiced person, one does sense there is a some bias to her writing. Not until page 139 does Barbara Ehrenreich reveal she is an atheist. Thus, one would think she would avoid churches. Yet she unashamedly goes to churches hoping to secure a job while lying about her background. She then grumbles that she wasted her time there. She mercilessly mocks common church-going people and those who don't accept her anticapitalist views. It is hard to imagine Ehrenreich walked into the church meetings without prejudice.   While it is true that bait and switch is going on in numerous HR departments, this book has nothing about that 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 Musically dull; vaguely reminiscent of The Cure but not as good.  I was given this CD as a gift.  After listening to it, I told her she could keep it.  
 I thought the book was appropriate for a young adult. I ended up giving it to my neighbors three year old son because it was more of a toddlers picture book. I felt the book was misrepresented online. 
 I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead. 
 I found this book to be nothing more than an instant replay of Maher's television shows. But then that's exactly what it's advertised to be. We should give thanks when we end up with something that's as advertised. It's just that after six years of Bush and Cheney, the truth is boring.  True, this is more of a soapbox than a review, but that's okay since I'm a registered Republican. George W. Bush has decreed that we're not governed by the same rules and laws as everyone else. It wasn't that long ago that Bush bashing was one of the loneliest jobs in the world. Now, if you're not careful, you'll get trampled under by the androids and politicians who are trying to distance themselves from Bush, Cheney and America's Dachau--Abu Ghraib and the Iraqi holocaust 
 Patrick Smith knows a lot about Japan, having lived there for several years and being a journalist specializing in the country. He knows more than I do, to say the least. It is therefore surprising that he should produce a report so reactionary and misleading, and attempt to support so many disparate theses with such poor or virtually non-existent arguments. (And even more surprising to me that it won an award) 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I have a Pioneer Inno and expected these to work based on the claim "works with all XM2go radios", but the packaging when it arrives says it is for MyFi radios and it has different connectors.  The product page here doesn't say Delphi MyFi, it says XM2go (which Inno is sold as). The product itself probably works fine for the sets it is designed for.  The 1 star is actually a complaint about the Amazon product description 
 Meredith Ann Pierce is hands down my favorite author of all time, but I really didn't see the point to this book.  The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution.  Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print.  Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy.  I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies.  Those were truly great works of literature 
 This GameCube is WEAK. I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems. Nintendo's recent system, the GameCube, has several problems with it's design. First of all, the internal fan is slow but, quiet. After an hour or so of use, the system overheats, thus shuts down. Second problem, the wireless controllers for this system SUCK. We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week. The brands we have tried: Pelican, Intec, Nintendo, and Osmart. The third problem is that the system was not built to last. I still have the NES and Nintendo 64, which both work great! I doubt the GameCube will last past 4-5 years of use. Simply put, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! ALSO! The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon. From the description and from the specs, you will need to stand up and interact (move around and stuff) with the game. Sounds fun but, would you like to do that after a hard day of work? It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy. 
 I was very disppointed in this product. I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer, but this was the only good quality. I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching. You could smell the plastic in the milk. I'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals, especially when her liver isn't developed enough to fully detoxify them. I really wanted to love this product, but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option 
 This is just a giant slap in the face! First of all, WB totally bothches the first season, and THEN try to get you to pay for a DVD with THREE episodes on it! How insulting! The second season is better, but still garbage. They should focus more on Justice League Unlimited. Now, THAT is a show worth watching 
 I know Modest Mouse better than you do sh-shah, sh-shah! My son is 15 years old and cooler than Miles Davis, and that is all he listens to.  They, he, whatever, wouldn't be so bad if they would tune their guitars, take some voice lessons, and check into re-hab. Sometimes I think I'm listening to a stretched cassette tape playing under water or somebody gargling in a blender.  
 Very insular and without context.  I wonder if this is how post-modern lit will seem in 50 years 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 I had bought this for a friend/co-worker as I would never purchase something so lame for myself, plus I am not into these stupid types of lame movies.  People who like this movie probably liked Breakin', Honey and La Bamba. OKay so La Bamba was actually a decent movie.  Anyway, just like all the other reviewers had already stated, this album is missing the better songs from the movie apparently.  If you really want the songs from the movie you might be better off holding a tape recorder to your tv next time the movie is on 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Not exactly what I was looking for.  I was looking for a book that would guide me through the pit falls but what I received was a mish mash of vague ideas and then comments like, "I hope you see that this stuff is great." It was like reading molases. Please learn to create outlines and procedural steps. Everything in this book can be learned from online tutorials and the 3DS Max help and tutorial system.  If you like prety pictures you might buy this as a coffee book but don't expect to get any real tips as to how to get up to speed making those images 
 This time last year I bought Potatoes Not Prozac (PnP)after I stumbled onto the radiant recovery website.  Having suffered from mild depression for over 20 years this book gave me hope to overcome the depression and also lose the weight I gained from overeating.  I found PnP to be an excellent read because Dr D was able to clearly express the science involved in sugar sensitivity.  I have followed the plan fairly closely for the past year, and while the depression is still there, it's not as bad and I've lost 30+ pounds.  Initially I resisted purchasing YLD because I thought there wouldn't be anything new.  I should have followed my instincts.  The book is a definite disappointment - nothing much new, little or no "science" compared to PnP, and largely just 200+ pages of rambling.  She spends far more time telling the reader how they will feel (too many testimonials that remind me of TV advertising) than what they need to do to get there.  Too much time is spent on nonsensical topics like "finding your personal style".  It seems Dr D was intent on capitalizing on the success of PnP and squeeze a few more bucks out of her readers 
 The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him.  BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit 
 Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing around in a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seen were not believable 
 I bought this CD because I like Carly's voice but was dissapointed with the song selection, it seemed like I was listenning to a CD of nursery rhymmes. However the music arrangements were good. Very dissapointed and threw the CD in the bin 
 Not very well known, but one of the most important artists in his styl 
 I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, "That it's not writing, it's typing," probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say.  What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing. 
 Not a difficult story to follow, staying alert will require a great deal of effort. Sudden impacts come off key and unceremoniously.  Maybe a rainy day with nothing to do book 
 This book is written assuming that you already know what went on, and fails to explain the details. I know that Carlyle was trying to re-invent the way we write history, but the book is practically unreadible 
 If you are a Christian looking for information about certain Bible topics then this dictionary is not for you.  There are even some sections where the author doubts the validity of Scripture and claims that there are faults in the Word of God.  If you are looking for wishy-washy details then this is the book for you.  If you believe the Word of God is just that THE WORD OF GOD, then don't buy this dictionary.  There are so many other Bible dictionaries out there that will be of much more help and guidance.  My suggestion to all....give this one a miss 
 Joel Hershman's "Greenfingers", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy.  In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening.  Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden.  But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?  Of course, this being a "romantic comedy" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed "uplifting moments".  And none of it works.  For all its good intentions, "Greenfingers" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates' rooms. It's all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 What movie was every one else watching?  Certainly not this one.  Very, very, slow.  Disjointed story line.  I hate to be a bore but this was boring.  Enjoy 
 Like others, I too find that my less than positive review has suddenly disappeared. What's up??? Censoring reviews that are not to the author's liking is not only despicable, it's un-American!!! 
 Hearing a lot about this book, i decided to finally check it out myself. a christian friend (a fairly devout one) told me about it as being a great source and great argument against all the different objections and problems people bring up concerning the gospels and the New Testamant and Jesus's divinity in general. I had read much of the New Testament and had many personal questions and objections (mainly contradictions that arise from comparing the christain faith as it is practiced today to the scripture on which it is based).   What i found exhasperated me. reading all the reviews for this book shock me even more. The only thing that i like about this book is the fact that he addresses most of the arguments against christianity and Jesus and much more. I also like the fact that it does provide plenty of rebuttle arguments against those objections (although unsatisfying).  What i really think is a major failure is the fact that his book only made it more clear to me how poor the case for christ divinity really is.   One of the biggest issues for the case for christ is scriptural support of his divinity (being God himself). I had raised some questions before reading the text about verses that really diminished such claim. Strobel does indeed address these points but all he does is show how these points really prove the Jesus was NOT GOD. i couldn't believe the arguments posed by the scholars and how readily the author was ready to accept whatever the scholars said.   An example: In Mark 10:17-18 Jesus replies to a man who just referred to him as a "good teacher" "Why do you call me good? No one is good--except God alone". Strobel brings up this point. can you explain how Jesus would say that if he was God??? well aparently the scholar can! the scholar explains this verse away by saying that jesus is really saying "do not call me that. do you really understand what you're saying when you say that? Are you really ascribing to me what should only be ascribed to God?" then the scholars proposes that that could be teased out to mean " I really am what you say; you speak better than you know"!!!!! and then the author just accepts that as a sound explanation of this verse and moves on. now the objection i have about this is that someone who would come and look at this verse objectively without a background in contemporary christian theology would NOT get that message out of it. for example, if a muslim, believing that Jesus is a prophet just like moses and abraham who's purpose is to guide people to the belief in the one true God, would read that, he/she would easily interpret that to say "God is good, we are not" just as simply as it is said by Jesus. as in, relatively Jesus is not good but rather God is good so aspire to His (God's, not Jesus's) Standards. In other words, the scholar interpreted that verse from a christian bias and lense and did not interpret it objectivly. i provided the Muslim example to show you what you get out of a biased interpretation based on prior believe concerning the topic (a muslim background for example).  this is only one of many examples throughout the text where it is clear that there is verey little objectivity in the interpretation and answers provided by the scholars which really makes me wonder just how strong of a case does Christ (at least as being God himself) really have???  I think my point is clear. go read it and find out for yourself 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 As a purchasing professional, I turned to this book to gain insight to new or advanced purchasing practices that might help me in my work and I was very enthusiastic about the book when I began reading it.  Instead of new knowledge, I found repetitive stories about the mass production environments in the automotive and related industries.  Although some new thoughts or ideas were presented, I did not feel as if this book taught me anything novel or cutting edge.  It is simply a repeat of purchasing concepts that can be found in many other operations or supply chain books flavored with managerial buzz words and the self-glorifying personal success stories of the authors and the companies they work for.  If you work in a job shop environment or for a small to medium size business, this book is virtually useless.  If you are in a huge mass production environment with a large budget, it might be of some value, but my guess is that you would already be familiar with the concepts presented 
 I like languages but, in general, I have little regard for phrase books. Occasionally, though, they can prove useful. This one is less useful than usual.  The title made me think in terms of "just getting by". Since that's about all phrasebooks are good for, it is accurate in this respect. Making out, however, has a different meaning in this title. It refers to making out in the sense of a couple of teenagers in the back seat of a car. This takes up relatively little space in the book; it's just a section toward the end. Most of the book is a garden variety, less comprehensive than most, phrasebook.  All of 6 pages are given over to grammar and teaching the script. The remainder is a compendium of phrases grouped according to topic. Some of the phrases are useful. Most are less so. As a man of the cloth, "I don't like wearing a condom" is not a subject which comes up, so to speak, very often.  This will not teach the language. Phrasebooks are not useful for that. This one will not present much in the way of useful phrases either. 
 I almost didn't finish this book.  I skipped/skimmed huge parts just to try and make it to the end.  I finally realized I didn't CARE what happened to any of these characters.  It was terribly slow in so many places.  I bought this at the airport - big mistake 
 "The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker!" exclaims a blurb on the cover.  Well, if so, I can tell you that a lot of people have been, or are going to be, VERY disappointed.  Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is, to paraphrase Mark Twain, like comparing lightning to the lightning bug.  This book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is "A Course in Power Poker."  Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson, but doesn't say anything about how to play.  Then we have Brunson's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System.  Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled, "My Story."  (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunson's "story," get a copy of According to Doyle (1984).  It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.)  Following "My Story" is a short history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which isn't much, and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker.  This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books.  However the tips are hardly "exclusive" for SuperSystem2 as claimed.  Beginning with Caro's cute but now very familiar, "In the beginning, everything was even money," most or all of the tips have been recycled.  For example, Tip #18, page 146, "WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...don't bluff" is just about the same as Tip #10 "Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you" found on page 137 in Caro's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996).  In fact Caro even recycles his "exclusive" tips in this very book.  Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you," while Tip #40 says in part that "OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away."  Jennifer Harman's chapter on limit hold'em is so ordinary that it's remedial.  There's not even a hint of anything new.  There are a number of books on the market that cover the same ground much more thoroughly.  I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big with Expert Play (2004) by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky.  Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards, "6-7" (e.g., on p. 252) instead of "76" is annoying and contrary to a well-established convention.  And the caricatures by Russ Braun!  They are so bland and flattering that each may have passed prior inspection by the subject's mother.  Comparing these to the witty and sharp work by Stan Hunt in the original is like comparing a cliche to something alive and vital.  Brunson doesn't even look like himself.  Here he's just a generic, smiling, dough boy kind of guy--except in the small, clever, lifelike drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt, copied from the first book.  Good are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better.  However, although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter, actually it was written (as acknowledged) by Mark Gregorich.  He does a good job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies, and I'm sure he is a fine player, but what about Bobby Baldwin?  Well, as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Bobby is far, far too busy to write the chapter himself.  So he just lent his name and his supervision.  Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F?  Perhaps the most embarrassing part of the book is Doyle's chapter on no limit hold'em.  It is little more than a reprise of the same chapter in the first book published 28 years ago.  Also recycled is the section on "Colorful Names of Various Hold'em Hands" on pages 628 and 629.  The dated references to Raquel Welch ("38") and Broderick Crawford ("10-4") seem more than a little out of touch.  Indeed, this book is nostalgic tribute to Brunson and the great success he and the original book achieved.  And that is a shame, because this book is billed as an exciting event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and, hopefully, the pocketbook of those involved.  One final thing: there is a Glossary, suitable for beginners, which is okay as it defines such things a "Deuce," "Flush," "Four of a Kind," etc., but seems a little basic for "A Course in Power Poker."  Worse though is this definition of a "Cold Deck": "A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they're not getting enough playable or winning hands."  Players may indeed remark that "the deck is cold," but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a stacked deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be "cold" to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked.  Bottom line: pass 
 Our Classic Tin Kaleidoscope arrived with a huge dent in it not in a separate box but thrown in with another item we ordered, and the return policy would not include shipping the item back, the cost for shipping would be more then the Kaleidoscope itself, so we kept the dented version, it works fine, but the dented casing is not a good sell....would recommend to make sure this gets shipped with a trustworthy company that knows how to wrap an item 
 it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage 
 More a shaggy dog story than a novel. Really an extended short story meant for publication in a literary magazine or New Yorker. It is barely developed. No question. there are some  amusing insights related to obsession and creative jealousy. It can be read in about an hour.   I wonder if a new author could have found a publisher 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 Ok, Let's make things clear I am huge Harrison/Beatles fan who cannot get enough of them.  But honestly, this is one document that just doesn't cut  it.  Talk about awful, pitiful lyrics that have no meaning and sometimes do not make sense.  A lot of songs sound like no effort was put into them or they were improvised or were just there to fill a 10 song album.  Production sounds just like a 1970's disco jam session, Harrison's guitar isn't even showcased at all and his chord progressions sound simple enough for Ringo Starr  to play them after 6 months of lessons.  Skip this and buy "all things must pass" which is the white album of Harrison 
 After reading this book, I would have to say Michael Apple did a wonderful job using examples to describe how modern public schools in the United States are flawed. He also did a good job introducing ideas, which might have been alien to many people, regarding elements of public education in America. However, it seems he spends too much time on the tautology of blaming Republicans for the misfortunes and pratfalls of present pedagogy. One must remember that Democrats and Republicans are both cut from the same cloth. In addition, if Apple wants to scream bloody murder about how many blemishes that Republicans have caused public education, he needs to remember that Democrats really have not made it any better. The "No Child Left Behind" act is something that both the left and the right support, and after working in public education for over a year, I can tell you this act really does not work.  Apple does explain notions of Channel One and product placement in public schools, which then dictates curriculum. He also goes into detail about how the media influences education and contemporary society. Nevertheless, he spends more time pointing fingers and telling you what is wrong. However, he never expresses any lucid or tangible means to ameliorate this quagmire facing our youth and public education.   There is a fine line between making a wonderful argument and whining like a baby. Apple does a great job performing the latter. Mind you, Republicans are not perfect politicians by any stretch of the imagination. Just look at some of the things that have happened over the past few years. Yet, Apple's diatribe seems more like whimpering, instead of fighting back, or addressing a solution to all the things, he is complaining about. Overall, this is an interesting read, but Apple is nowhere near the philosophical icon of John Dewey.   
 "Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off" and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a letdown 
 I have been reading several good guides to the Montessori method, including one volume from the library I was able to get written by Montessori herself.  I was hopeful that this book by Lillard would give good sound advice for practical current infant Montessori techniques based on a sound knowledge of Montessori.  Unfortunately this was not the case.    My biggest complaint regarding this book was the disregard shown to infant well being.  Leaving an infant alone for extended periods of time is not advisable and can be dangerous.  I had a very large objection to her advice that infants should be weaned at 9 months whether the infant seemed "ready" or not.  That certainly does not seem to be respecting an infant's innate intelligence.  Then there was the potty training at 12 months advice.  Well that may be great if your child is showing signs of readiness, it would not be advisable for the many many infants who are simply not developmentally ready at that stage.  Those ideas of the author are in direct conflict with Montessori principles of giving children materials for their developmental readiness.  Not all children will be ready then and forcing them as the author seems to suggest will not likely lead to positive results.    There are much better guides out there and this one I simply cannot recommend as it is harsh and gives an impression of Montessori principles that is not truly accurate in many instances.  
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 This is the usual humanistic rosy misportrayal of organic evolution. As always, trivial changes within species or within genera are blindly extrapolated to molecules-to-man evolution. The numerous contradictory  opinions within human evolutionary scenarios are conveniently glossed over.  Creationism is rejected as science because it supposedly is simply a  belief. In truth, whether you agree with creationists or not, you must face  the fact that creationists rest their positions not just on religious  beliefs but also on the empirical evidence 
 The author of this was toted to be an upcoming and compared too... what.  It is well written, but the plot, action and premises of this is yet to "get to me".  As to "..... Are we  there yet?"  I still have yet to figure out what it has to do with the story of the book. 
 This dvd does not contain enough nudity as it should.  The pace of the video is really slow, which makes it boring. Is not worth the time or money 
 The book can be characterized as Greenspan's testimonies interspersed with the authors' interpretation of Greenspan's words in the context of what really happened thereafter. Quite interesting are Greenspan's (and not the authors') take on the 1997 Asian financial crisis and reforming Social Security, quite relevant considering W.'s desire to overhaul the system.   If the Internet has not gone mainstream, this could have been a very good book, however, Greenspan's testimonies can be readily accessible in http://www.federalreserve.gov - and a reasonably astute reader can easily do the analysis and place it in the context of what happened thereafter which is exactly what the authors did. It could have been better if the book concentrated on the inner workings of the Fed. Some anecdotes inside Fed meetings could have gone a long way.  The book also has problems with the light treatment it gives to its subject. Case in point - though it mentions that Greenspan looks at key indices and meets with the Fed governors before coming up with his testimony, it never comes around to explaining how he does it in detail.  Overall, the "Greenspan Effect" may be a good introductory primer on the Fed but its lack of focus and detail plunges it to the ranks of all those futile attempts to explain every nuance of Greenspan's pronouncements and ending up where they started. 
 I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore.  Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so!  Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring.  Was this a mystery?  I don't remember much of a plot at all.  Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts.  Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?  Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable.  For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison 
 I bought this book and disliked it so much that it was the one and only book I have ever returned to Amazon. It was terribly dated which would have been acceptable if the content was there but it wasn't. Save some money AND get what you're looking for in Color Drawing: Design Drawing Skills and Techniques for Architects, Landscape Architects, and Interior Designers by Michael E. Doyle. That's what I replaced it with and I love it 
 Get the other one by Dennis Ricthie for a C reference manual.  This one is very difficult to follow 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it.  Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to "save" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable.  Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression?  It truly seems like another writer.  This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity 
 Regional bias, personal preference, oxidized paint chips with no color correction, and a near-absence of sales volume research -- what we get is ineptitude in place of the academic rigor one would expect.   Regardless of how user-friendly and 'helpful' readers find it, what good is it if its information is invalid 
 I would not neccessarily call this book "Christian".  It is more of an historical account, Bible as literature type of book.   It does make you think about different aspects of Jesus life, but most of that is speculation or perception.    Yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end.   
 I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say 
 I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her! 
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 You know it's interesting, when you open the Ramtha web site of the "School of Wisdom", one finds a high school  essay in NeoPlatonic Metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats, however when you hit the link that says who is Ramtha, you get a "this information is not available" message, kinda makes you go, HHMMMMMMM????!!!   now don't get me wrong folks, Edgar Cayce and the author of a Course in Miracles might have tapped into something, but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative, it kind of reminds me of the lines in the Revenge of the Sith movie that Palpatine gave to Anakin to turn him to the dark side!!!!!  You know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik, you know esteemed Jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the Sith; or even Tolkien's Saruman,  hey folks get Christopher Lee's opinion of the DVD before you fork over your hard earned bucks, and uh...do a search on this Ramtha spirit, er channeled, er thingy!!! Live Long and Prosper!! 
 This is a good book for fantasy or romance readers.  Have you ever seen The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston?  This novel has lots of interactions reminiscent of that movie...muscular, sweaty single dimensional men grabbing women by the shoulders and booming dialogue into their faces....beautiful, single-dimensional women melting in their arms... If you enjoy historical fiction and are looking for a more authentic historical novel, try reading Sharon Kay Penman 
 I am kind of disappointed at this book. The illustration is dull. The words are plain.   Not very appealing for preschoolers or 1-2 graders, while it is too simple for a savvy reader. I would not recommend it for either gifts or self use. 
 This book, as stated by a previous reviewer, is not really for younger children.  Even worse, it presents rumors as fact .  Warren Harding was rumored to have joined the KKK, even though  most of the evidence comes from Klan members themselves.  Many historians doubt this happened and have sited far more reliable sources.  One of my students, for example, takes this book at face value.  It proved a positive learning experience about taking this stuff as is in the book, however, I wish I had not had to do that.  
 Why do you need a water house for a camera that is 10m water proof  
 If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you.  Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else.  The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries.  Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull.  Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious 
 I purchased this item hoping that it would make leveling and torting round cakes easier.  The "blade" (a simple wire) does nothing to work through a sturdier or crusty cake, and in the process of trying to get it to do so, the cake gets damaged.  I had nothing but problems with this item, and had to use my trusty bread knife to repair the damage from the leveler!  I am back to using my knife to level and torte my cakes, and feel stupid for wasting the money on this item.  My recommendation: stick with the tried and true method.  It works perfectly every time 
 This book is useless. The only thing you get is even more tests. There are only Dooo Doooo sounds on the cd and the answers on the book. Dont waste your money 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 The action and dialog of this film are easily one of the worst ones I ever have seen. The plot is highly improbable, the form how the lifes of these two kids develop impossible. The behavior of the two defies all logic and is a bad transplant from what somebody who seemingly never lived through adolescence nor ever read a book about it believes to be adolescent behavior to an idyllic south sea island. The admittedly very good photography cannot save the moment nor let the viewer forget the stupidity of the movie itself. This is compounded by the total acting incompetence of Brooke Shields - and she isn't even good-looking enough to forgive her for her ineptitude. 
 I gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months, even cut through chicken bones.  But just like the other reviews, the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment.  I used these for making chicken soup alot, but noticed that it also doesn't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken I like to be extra careful. So the next set I get I'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from Henckels this time 
 The New Nelson, is still practical as the old one with thousand of characters more. It is the best tool on the market for every body using japanese language at the beginning-intermediate levels. In Italy, we don't have Japanese-Italian dictionary so we loved the old Nelson and now much more the new one 
 The author credits himself with writing a type of history which is complete and fully in the context of broader events.  But somehow he manages to miss some of the larger ramifications of the very events he is describing in this book.  He seems to be attempting to minimize the impact that these three infamous trials had on Jewish and wider history before and after the turn of the last century.  Most historians realize that the Dreyfus Affair had such profound effect on European Jewry that it served as an impetus for the ongoing Zionist migration to Palestine at the time.  Theodore Herzl was a journalist at the time who was so profoundly affected by what he saw in France during the Dreyfus Affair that he founded the first Zionist congress in 1897 in Basle, Switzerland as a direct result.  This, of course, has had significant impact on world history.  But Lindemann pretends that life went on its merry way for Jews in Europe afterwards.   And in the United States, he has a similar blind spot regarding the historic significance of the lynching of Leo Frank.  After bending over backwards to suggest that the prosecutor, the press, and even the enraged mobs were not driven by anti-Semitism in this case, he tops it off by missing the largest single lesson of the entire ugly affair.  In the immediate aftermath of the brutal lynching of Leo Frank, the Ku Klux Klan was revived and vastly outgrew its former incarnation.  Many well-known leading citizens of Georgia (including then current, former and future members of the Georgia House of Representatives) formed what they called the Knights of Mary Phagan (named after the girl who's murder was falsely attributed to Leo Frank).  The lynching party grew from this group, many of whom gathered at night several weeks later on top of Stone Mountain (east of Atlanta) to burn a huge cross and form the KKK.  But none of this is mentioned by Lindemann 
 I try very hard to give a book a chance- but this one was difficult to get through. I had to skip over parts until I came to some dialogue due to the description would continue on and on and on. It was not until I got 3/4's of the way through the story that really got interesting.  The romance did not start until the end of the book.  The story is great- but I agree with others that the characters were not even aware of each other.  I don't recommend reading this one 
 Don't waste your money on this.  Book is just an outline of possible available avenues for securing capital - but absolutely nothing applied to my situation.  It's been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust 
 I'm 18 and I just finished reading this book.  I gave it two stars only because of the amount of SAT words.  The book is really bad and to make it worse, it was mandatory for a class I took.  I was really disapointed at the story line and I was expecting a much better read.  The SAT words were great and there is a lot of them, but I found it more enjoyable to read magazines even though there are much less SAT words.  However, everybody learns differently.  I learn SAT words with flash cards while other people learn SAT words by reading books.  Its not a long book and it can be educational, so read it for the SAT words.  Remember those SAT words but forget the story 
 I am a huge fan of Karen Clark Sheard.  I have all of her Cds so I knew that if I bought this cd without listening to it first I would not be disappointed.  However, I was very disappointed after listening to it.  The only song that I really like is "Favor."  She is very talented and I love her voice and song arrangements.  I love her to death but this cd is just not working for me 
 I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book.  I normally love Katie MacAlisters books, they are amusing and have something new even if she does have to rip off the whole Dark Ones thing.  Jennifer Ashely's story was ok, at least her cheesiness is part of the storyline.  But Minda Webber's contribution, I can't even get through.  If it's not a pun or some trite cliche about vamps, werewolves etc. on every page, it's her mama's trite colloquialisms.  Then Val, the main character would think something and the very next paragraph Lucy would say something stupid about knowing how he feels about something he just thought.  Or Lucy would think one of her trite thoughts and then Val would say in an admiring way something using the same words, Ugh, awful.  And the maturity level of the writing and the characters....it's one thing to say over and over how immature Lucy is, but Val's just as bad.  Some of the situations they are in are straight out of high school.  Everything is overeacted to, Val either hisses or says something savagely.  Always at the wrong time and Lucy has absolutely no impules control.  I couldn't even dredge up any kind of sympathy or empathy or itty bitty liking for these characters.  What a train wreck 
 Okay, so this book isn't THAT bad, but there are better organization books that take a little longer to implelement but work much better in the long run.  I recommend that teenagers should instead read the FlyLady cleaning book and use the control journal idea in conjunction with this book to keep their room clean.  They must devise their own system and that takes a lot of time and trial and error, but this book won't solve all of the organization problems, it needs more.  Trust me, I am 15, I spend about 10 minutes a day keeping my room neat, and it is always perfect.  I also have tons of time for everything I want to do 
 its made nice but the frame is kind of wobbly and its kinda in the way when takeing the lid off and o 
 When I think of the Civil War I think of excitement and danger. I expect  to read a good rich book about it. Yet this book squeezes all the fun out  of thesubject War. Yes, war is nothing fun yet it may be exciting and  detailed. This book totally lacks all this information. Yet it does tell of  the blood thirsty belligerent Generals that are awaiting battle. I have a  love of books, all throughout my life. I have read many too. I highly don't  recommend this book for pleasure reading. Unless you want to get details  for an essay, forget about it 
 This book is full of inaccuracies. I can't believe other reviewers haven't noticed this.   If I knew where it was, I would pull it out and point out some examples. But, since I can't, I will say from memory, that the author didn't know words to songs. He was quoting lyrics and trying to interpret songs, and quoting lyrics that were demonstrably incorrect.  Like, oh, "Can't Get There From Here". There was a music video released for this song, that was captioned by the band. Many of the lyrics were there, in readable letters, for all the world to see. I thought, "This guy must have never seen the music video. That's kind of sloppy research, to have not seen the videos of the band that you're trying to write a book about." Then, later, it became clear that he HAD seen this video, or at least had had someone else summarize it to him. And he still got the lyrics wrong. Mysterious, brain-shattering idiocy.  That is just one small example. The book is full of garbage like that.  And, god, the song interpretations. Laughable. Hilariously bad.   Not to mention, what is up with the author's snobby, bratty attitude? Not a very good tone to take, when your research is so bad and incomplete, and frequently shoddy.  The book is good for writing mocking notes in the margins. It's VERY good for that. It's also good if you like to circle or underline misinformation 
 Don't buy this price increased version.  I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model.  Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries.  The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it.  This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue.  If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating.  While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own.  It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control.  It's extremely frustrating.  For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 This is sci-fi gone wrong.  It is all ideas and science, and nothing else.  The plot is a joke, I found myself going, "What??," and shaking my head many times.  The same goes for the characters.  For example: (a) Humankind has been at war with the incorrigable Xelee for 20,000 years, and yet, within weeks, incredible breakthroughs are made, one after the other, ending in utter victory after a few months.  (b) There is no believability in why the protagonist is in certain situations.  He is a hero....no, he is a convicted criminal and sent to a penal colony....no, the penal colony is really an army base....no, at another character's new whim he is put in a key position in the fight against the Xelee...etc. (c) The characters are similarly inconsistent and/or predictable and/or unbelievable.  I've heard Baxter has written some very good work.  This is definitely not one of them.  It has interesting ideas, but little else.  One wonders if the author was under contract pressure or financial pressure to get a book out.  Anyway, I finally gave up and quickly skimmed the last 40% of the book, I just couldn't finish it.  If you really want to read this book, borrow it from the library or from a friend.  Don't spend your hard earned money on it 
 You know what's funny?  Monkeys and Midgets. You know what's not? This book, it's serious. Don't buy it. Get a copy from a Jehova's witness next time they come to your door 
 Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more. (SARR)          
 I am a huge krups fan, so I thought I would outfit my new kitchen with a sleek new model, as Pro Aroma was no longer available.  This coffee maker is awful.  The stench of plastic that it emits during brewing and when you pour the coffee is disgusting.  At least half of enjoying coffee is that wonderful smell, right?  Not with this one.    Krups has been extremely unhelpful and will not acknowledge the issue.  Their advice is to "descale" the maker.  Because, of course, mineral buildup always smells like melted molded plastic.  Good tip, boys.  Save your money, this is not Krups best work 
 I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it 
 They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it. What a poor effort! 
 Before watching the movie, I had read the book.  Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing the story come to life on the silver screen.  Unfortunately, the story didn't survive its on-screen adaptation.  Although many of the events were similar, the film lost much of the hideous reality of Augustine Burrough's childhood.  Reading the book, I could see how something like this could happen in real life.  However, the movie Hollywood-ized the original story to make it palatable to the common movie-goer, who seems to like things tidy.  The Finch home in the story bristled with life.  Its messiness seemed to leap from the page.  The movie killed that life.  I felt distanced from the mess.  I didn't live with it like I did when reading the book.  I wanted to see the remains of last month's meal lying on top of the television.  I wanted to see the roaches crawling across the unwashed dishes in the kitchen. Instead, we got long shots of the mess that didn't allow us to really look at it.    I was also displeased with the changes to the story itself.  Instead of many children, Dr. Finch had only two.  In real life, a man like that would have more than two children.  It just makes sense because of his philosophy on life being less than conservative.  In addition, the extra children made the family seem larger and crazier.  As I was reading, I could hardly keep everyone straight.  Also, Agnes in the movie was transformed into a foil for Augustine's mother.  Although Agnes wasn't a perfect mother in the movie, she was better than Deidre.  She gave Augustine a small piece of sanity in an otherwise chaotic world.  In the book Augustine didn't seem to have that.  Agnes certainly wasn't put together enough to be a mother to him.  Instead, she seemed to me to be an embodiment of the house-- broken and in need of repair.  But Hollywood seems to need things neat and tidy.  It needs to give Augustine a mother when he needs one.    However, real life isn't like that.  In real life it can happen that a child like Augustine could be left adrift without anyone at all.  The Augustine of the memoir didn't seem to have anyone to turn to, unless you count Neil Bookman, the disturbed older man who practically raped Augustine during their first sexual encounter, or Natalie, who was just as lost as Augustine was, if not more so.    As for Natalie herself... in the book, she was very self-conscious about her weight.  She and Augustine would eat at McDonald's, and she'd call herself a cow.  In the movie, she was thin and, despite the heavy makeup, almost model-worthy.  Again, the movie took a real life person and shaped her into a Hollywood version of herself.  And Hope was even more of a stereotype than a real person.  She was just crazy and frigid.  We didn't see the side of her that was a friend to Augustine in the early years.    In short, the movie sucked the life out of the book and created a bland, un-entertaining cliche of a film that wasn't even interesting in its own right, let alone when being compared to the book.  My two friends who'd never read the book didn't like it any more than I did.  I just want to yell at Hollywood to stop imitating itself.  It's like the execs have found a formula, and they are afraid to deviate from it, even for something more interesting.  If they'd have stuck to the book a little more closely and been more true to life, people would have wanted to watch   because of how real it was-- and how surreal.  What kept me reading was that I knew that Augustine's kind of life was being lived right now.  I'm an English teacher, and I often wonder what kinds of homes my students go to.  The book opened that world up to me, and although I didn't like what I saw, I could understand it better having read about it.  Sadly, the movie took all that poignancy away and left a hollow shell.  The only redeeming part of the movie was its soundtrack, which somehow made the film more tolerable.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I would, however, recommend the book.  It was an interesting read about an interesting life, and the movie didn't even come close to doing it justice 
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 This book is a course requirement; otherwise it would not have been purchased.  In my opinion this is unquestionably the worst textbook I have every read.  I have read a lot of textbooks, over 60 boxes worth, both as a student and a professor.  Some have been a good read, others not.  In all of them I have found at least something worthwhile.  Not this time.   This is the most confusing, redundant, turgid, and poorly edited book I have ever read.  There seems to be an inverse relation between the amount of text devoted to a topic and its' complexity, e.g. "percentaging (sic) a table".  The discussion, in chapter 16, on correlation and regression is without a doubt the single worst presentation on the topic I have ever seen.  Since this is the 10th edition, you would think Babbie and the publisher would have gotten it right.  They didn't.  I think a more appropriate description is a first edition repeated nine times.   Babbie may be a fine instructor and a prominent researcher, but this is a terrible piece of babble and banality.   I would give the book a zero if the system allowed it.  
 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 I purchased a CD player to play CDs.  Out of the box it wouldn't work.  Then I was told it couldn't be returned.  It took three weeks before a shipping label arrived and that might make it too late to get credit as it had to be returned in 30 days.  I sent it back as soon as I was in receipt of the label.  I protested through my credit card company.  I am not pleased and will probably never use Amazon again.  Not a good start to this relationshi 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?   Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen 
 The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject 
 This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market 
 After having it I understood that the book is not that I want. I'm interested in sailing more than boating. But after reading it I've found many things to learn about boating also. If Your aim is  sailing this book is not for you, but if You are a beginner to "boating" You'll find many "need to know"s. Good book, I advice 
 Beware of Spoilers: The story started good and went continually downhill. I don't need a happily ever after, but this ending was too much of a dramatic stretch and the Author seemed to enjoy to punish Jennifer Parker for falling in love with the wrong guy. Some plot points were utterly unbelievable, incl. killing off her son, taking away her friends, killing off her lover and Jennifer's true love Adam, who does nothing much than whining how he loves her, but sadly, his wife just got pregnant....same old, same old. I reckon the story is too outdated to be plausible any more. It was the first book I read from Sidney Sheldon and I am not going to read another novel from him. 
 I agree with the previous reviewer - the belt clip works fine overall.  However, I dinged the product way more b/c you have to remove it EVERY time you want to turn your Shuffle on or off.  It would be one thing if it were every time you needed to charge the Shuffle or reload songs (which you also have to do), but this is twice every single time you want to use your Shuffle, which for me is 4 or 5 times a week.  That's just not practical.  Frankly I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't consider that when they designed the belt clip, and I wish I had known about it before I bought it 
 I have been a student of Dr. Palmer's at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, and while I admire his ecoanthropology teachings, this book is beyond his scope as an anthropologist. Dr. Palmer's most knowledgeable topics are those of the fishers of Maine and New Foundland. Some of Dr. Palmer's best works are those he did with his former professor and mentor, Lyle Steadman at ASU regarding folklore, mythology and ancestor teachings. If I could have previewed this work before it was published, I would have said, "Craig, stick with what you know!" His documentaion is weak at best, and some of it is truly questionable.  While I understand his logic behind this topic, I think his facts are weak. I suppose, if one were inclined, one could turn any set of numbers, statistics or facts to fit the hypothesis they have developed. I think that's what Craig and Randy Thornhill have done. Craig has written some absolutely wonderful works, however, this is not one of them.   My suggestion would be that readers find this in the library and not spend money on it, read it, then come to your own conclusions on whether or not you agree with the evolutionary basis of rape. 
 My kids (okay, my husband) purchased me a junior cookbook for Mother's Day last year. My 3-year-old and I have enjoyed several recipes out of that book. I decided to try and find another book that we would enjoy as well. After reading the online reviews for this book, I made the purchase. However, when it arrived, I was disapointed to find a lot of recipes that wouldn't fit my family's tastes. I thought the illustrations for the recipes was a clever idea, but didn't like the idea of flipping back and forth from the drawings to the detailed instructions. I'm returing this book and will again begin my quest to find a cookbook that my kids and I can enjoy together 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I couldn't get past Chapter 6. Abbie is pathetic. Just when you think you have her figured out, something will be stated that completely changes your perception of her. However, that statement never has basis anywhere else in the book, and doesn't fit in with Abbie's personality. The book itself is not very funny, and not at all a gripping read. I do not recommend it 
    I have owned Heatter's 'chocolate deserts' book for years, and it is a great book for the most part, so I have been VERY dissapointed in her 'cakes' book. Cakes of all kinds are my speciality, and this is just a poor, poor cookbook. Nearly all of the recipies contain odd errors-especially in baking times-if you try to use this book, be very careful, cuz her overly specific baking times are usually too long. Neither of my kitchens have been able to make her times work as printed.    The recipies themselves are very odd as well-frankly, most of the times that I have gotten them to be succesful, people dont really like them that much. It seems like her goal was to collect as many recipies as she could that involved at least thirty dollars worth of nuts and dried fruit. "Fruitackes" would have been a more accurate title for this book. For God's sake even the chocolate cakes are packed full of fruit etc. Yuck.    The cheesecake section of the book speaks for itself in the overwrought fussiness department...almost all of the recipies just sound gross-reading the ingredients is enough to ruin your appetite...way, way overdone.    I would definetly recomend her chocolate desert book, but this one goes in the trash. I gave it the benefit of the doubt for a while, but that only goes so far!    
 This book did not live up to its hype. It tries to do for Guenevere what Mists of Avalon did for Morgan le Fey, but it fails sorely because the title character is an embittered shrew. The plot repeats itself endlessly over the course of three novels. Guenevere loves Arthur, she hates Arthur, she forgives Arthur, she loves Arthur again, no wait, she hates him.... Arthur, by the way, is a weak, feeble-minded, doddering simpleton. This is not the great king of Arthurian legend at all. Lancelot is still a tasty dish, but there is no apparent reason why he would love a bitter, jealous, middle-aged woman who repeatedly casts him away. Morgan le Fey starts out as a promising character, but becomes a demonic harpy-type creature. And the tone is excessively anti-Christian. I'm not a religious person at all, but even I was offended by the way Christians are depicted in this novel. It's just not a pleasant read. If you want a great trilogy told from Guenevere's point of view, read Persia Woolley's Guenevere trilogy or Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. They're well worth the time and effort 
 This film deserves to have as little said about it as possible. It is endlessly and offensively brutal, bathed in mindless bloodshed. Unlike the excellent movie, "The Long Good Friday," this tells us nothing about the protagonists, aside from the fact that they are depraved. We should be able to figure that out without help. Claiming to like this film because it offers insights is like claiming that a John Holmes film is essential to understanding the biology of reproduction. It is a lie that justifies a prurient interest in violence 
 I bought this version to augment our homeschool study of Julius Caesar because it had so many actors whom I recognized.  But right from the opening credits, I could not read the blurry titles or names, and I eventually gave up because my eyes got tired from squinting in an unconscious effort to try to bring   this hopelessly poor-quality film into focus.  I wondered if it was a pirated copy.  On the other hand, what I saw of it was just what I wanted: vintage actors trying their hand at a kind of acting I have rarely seen most of them do.  I was expecting a fine performance from John Geilgud, and was not disappointed.  Diana Rigg was reasonable as Portia. Robert Vaughan's excellent Casca was a very pleasant surprise, quite a change of pace since the last time I saw him he was the Man from U.N.C.L.E. As for Jason Robards, he and Shakespeare should just avoid each other;  Robard's performance was wooden and his lines delivered in a flat voice. Still, what I saw of it was good, nostalgic fun, and I truly regret having to return the DVD; but in the end, I could not watch it because of the poor quality of the filming 
 I just returned the PHAROS gps for PDA's.  I have had a Garmin for 2 years and wanted an upgrade.  I chose this because it was a little cheaper than the Garmin GPS-10.  Wow, was I wrong.  Having used 3 personal GPS units over the past few years I do know a little about what to expect.  I am in sales and need the information for places I am typically not too familiar with.  Here is a list of Pros and Cons on this model:  PROs: 1. Price: It is 30-50$ less 2. 3D View: The OSTIA software does have a neat (but not necessary)3D effect  CON's: 1. Slow updating (I was passing Hwy exits before the GPS knew it) 2. Hardly any options on the PC for planning a trip with stops 3. Voice Prompts are not very helpful (only has 10 phrases) 4. OUT OF DATE MAPS!! My neighborhood has been around for 5+ years and it is not listed (along with many others around DFW). The GPS (garmin) I bought 2 years ago had more up to date maps. 5. You have to pay 5$ a month for PointOfInterest access (you can't look up a Chili's near you, or ANY RESTAURANT AT ALL) 6. Poor Customer service (40 mins on hold trying to get help)  5. 
 When I bought this book, I was already a "pre-trib" guy, and a big fan of the Left Behind series.  I thought this book would help me as a Bible student to have a clear grasp of Biblical eschatology.   After I read this book, I realized that the Bible has absolutely nothing to do with a secret rapture followed by seven years of anti-christ led chaos.  I was amazed at how weak and utterly careless Lahaye is in his exposistion of Scripture.  For instance, his insistance that the 'Day of the Lord' and the 'Day of Christ' must be differant.  One of his main arguments in favor of a secret rapture is that since judgement is not mentioned in John 14:1-3 or 1 Thess.4:16-17, this MUST be a seperate event from the final judgement!   One good thing that came from reading this book is that it led me to consider other interpretations of the end times.  For far more careful study, try "Four Views on the Book of Revelation," by C. Marvin Pate, "The Last Days according to Jesus," by R.C. Sproul, or my favorite, "The Church and the Last Things," by Martyn Lloyd-Jones 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 Fortunately, it has been a long time since I read anything this sappy, sophomoric and/or senseless.  Frankly, I'm amazed this series was published.  Adriana Trigiani is a harlequin romance writer at best (i.e. fabio visits the farm), and it's unlikely she'll ever produce literature of quality.  I left this book in a Portland coffee shop (on purpose), and it was still there when I returned two weeks later!  Go figure, eh? 
 I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited. I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time 
 and it's very hard to remove the dust - frequent washing is the only way!  It fits Zen Vision: M very well, but the feel in hand is terrible, especially when it collects tons of dust on it 
 It seems to me that the author overrelies on newspaper accounts in her research, which are often notoriously unreliable, especially if far removed from the events that are being described. In addition, newspaper accounts during the Border War were characterized by extreme bias, and Etchison quotes them often without commenting on inaccuracies and distortions, which only reinforces their error. She is sometimes coy in the narrative mode, so much so that even in the description of John Brown ruthlessly hacking to death and shooting the Doyles at Pottatawatomie Creek, she fails to mention who is killing and mutilating, only referring to an "angular old man" in charge and does this for fully a page of text, then only referring to the maniac Brown indirectly, as "old man Brown." What "old man Brown"? What is more incredible, no, flabbergasting, is that she doesn't mention that Brown is killing the three Doyles because they carry warrants for John Brown's arrest for intimidating a Kansas Territorial supreme court judge, a dismal failure in research it seems to me. She also uses the old hackneyed propaganda terms, "bushwhackers," instead of the more accurate, value-neutral term "guerrillas" in describing Missouri insurgents, and also, laughably, employs Horace Greeley's coined, centuries-old, favorite propaganda term, "Border Ruffians" and "ruffians" to describe the Missouri elites' actions in Kansas, an unforgivable, antiquated lapse by someone affecting objectivity. Etcheson's simplistic, description of the Border War is insulting to those who don't share her "liberal" interpretation of events. After 150 years of winners' histories, it's time for a lot more objectivity by our so-called "professional" historians. They should tell it like it is, not how they wish it to "appear" to the uninitiated.      
 After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope 
 I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back 
 Caveat emptor to the absolute beginner. This book is not written for the beginning web page creator. It is not written in a tutorial style. It is good as a reference source as you study a true tutorial type book. It discusses tags and their attributes one at a time without showing you how they fit into your web page code. The beginning chapters throw lots of advanced features at you and tell you they will be discussed in chapter 19 etc. I was completely overwhelmed after 20 min of reading. So what's a beginner to do? I recommend Create Your First Web Page in a Weekend. By the time you get half way through that book then you can use this dummies book as a reference. william 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 I found this book boring and bland. The recipes are not 'new' and fresh.  And they lack strong or tangy or interesting tastes. Very mediocr 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  It doesn't provide the real world facts about making an indie film as other books do.  It reads like an introductory textbook that skates over all the issues, but never really tells you the things you want to know about how to finance, cast, and sell an indie.  Don't waste your money here 
 This book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to "modern man." The author assumes modern men are "broken" and therefore must somehow be "fixed," and he offers his advice on how to go about being "A Real Man." Therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men; the same men who buy Hummers and/or guns and/or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood (real or perceived).  The author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles. While this is true for some boys and men, it is by no means a universal trait. Any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is; he will also find this book insulting and absurd.  Mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing; however, a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself. The danger of mentoring is that of the "alpha male" mentality taking over and running a boy's or young man's life to his detriment: when that occurs, cultist mentality takes over. (A good, and frightening, example of this is Robert Bly himself.) Taken too far, this mentality leads to horrors such as the People's Temple (Jim Jones and his mass murder-suicide), Heaven's Gate, Scientology, and a numberless other dangerous Follow-The-Leader mind-sets.  For those boys and men who feel they need such advice, a far superior book is "Fire in the Belly" by Sam Keen. It does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that "Iron John" does and it is far better thought-out as well as written 
 The problem with the "classics" is that too many hacks have hacked them to pieces. My opinion of these recordings, for whatever it is worth, is that they simply do not do justice to Strauss's magnificent music.  There is a reason they are a "bargain". I would avoid this set. Sometimes a boxed set is a good deal, but this one is not. I find the entire set unspeakably dull and literally unlistenable.   In any event, this is merely my opinion. The majority of the other reviewers think its terrific.     
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 the book is superficial and has the same plot in the beginning as MAD  JACK, another of her book 
 Thank You for the c.d. in great condition.  We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again.  Thanks again, N and L C 
 The violence in this movie was deeply disturbing and unnecessary. The way it was done was unnecessary. The car crash scene was unnecessary. Setting that scene up with a moment of such tenderness and drawing the audience in that way then slamming them with that scene was an act of cruelty and violence in and of itself. I was physically shaken and felt deeply betrayed by this. I didn't finish the movie. I doubt that I'll ever trust Ron Howard again. The book's violence was incidental to the story. The violence in the movie was almost savored. As an artist, I'm keenly aware of the bond of trust between an artist and his/her viewer. I consider it a sacred bond and never break it with my own art. While the movie was technically excellent, it simply betrayed the artist/viewer bond. Beyond that, it had no soul. There was no conviction in the presentation. It was rather like a picture of gourmet meal instead of the meal itself. Pretty to look at, but no flavor and not what one expected of a cast and crew of such sterling credentials.  Read the book instead. It won't hurt you like this movie will. If this review helps one person to avoid the kind of shock that I received, it will have been worth writing. Not everyone in the world is completely de-sensitized yet. There are people left who will be hurt by this kind of visual violence 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 I was mislead into wasting money on Jim Fay's audio book on toddlers and I think Amazon and other  booksellers have a responsibility to be honest with consumers about this series;   The author as a promoted as a "doctor" and yet the series is  about heavy handed fundamentalist Christian parenting.  I used to live in Denver, and because the authors made several references to Colorado I began to wonder  if this were something put out by the "Focus on the Family" extremist cult based in Colorado Springs;  I was right. The titles and descriptions are deliberately misleading, but if you click on the copyright link you'll see that this is where it came from.  When did these extreme Christian fundamentalist pass an amendment to the "Shall not lie" commandment? When did it become a "Christian Value" to disguise, mislead and lie about an agenda in order to sell something that they know the buyer would have avoided had we been given honest information beforehand?  For me, this validates the fear that a lot of people in Colorado had expressed about this group. It also shows how  much the extreme Christian right has in common with the Muslim extremist in Afghanistan:  Both groups are willing to disregard the core dictates of the  religion they claim to follow if it serves their efforts to make money or to impose their  beliefs on the rest of the word.  I purchased the "Toddler Love and Logic" audio book from this series, and after the first 10 minutes of listening  to the these two men laughing at (and sarcastically imitating  the voices of) mother's they've overheard making " mistakes" in conversations with their children, I realized the real mistake had been in wasting my money.  Why would they use "Logic" in the title of a book that tells parents that they shouldn't take the time to explain the reasoning behind the 'commands' they make to their children? And what is logical about using a child's bedroom as a punishment during the day and expecting them to  view it as a comfortable safe place at bedtime? 
 I tried 2 recipes from this book and was sufficiently disappointed that I will probably not use this book again. The "Four-Spice Fantasies" were completely bland and puffy/cakey in texture rather than chewy, while the "Oatmeal Cinnamon" cookies, though better than the former, were nothing to write home about. People should let me know if any of her other ones are worth trying.  Otherwise I now only go to allrecipes.com for user-rated recipes 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 I am rather disapointed, the first few chapters are interesting, but later on it gets really boring when it gets into simple enumeration of facts and linked theories... That book indeed gave me lust to read the very other books it criticises 
 I loved the watch when I first received it.  I wore it two or three times, then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up.  I tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so I stopped wearing it.  
 this purchase was a waste of my money, I do not know what else to say, but I may use it for firewood 
 Ok, Perhaps the recipes are great, but unlike his other books with great illustrations, I might have just picked up a world dictionary that doesn't entise the imagination.  Again, the recipes are most likely wonderful, but when it comes to cookbooks, I prefer ones that are visual and tantilizes all my sences when reviewing a meal 
 This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I had to force myself to finish it, mostly because the storyline was a slight bit interesting and I wanted to know "whodunnit," but there were so many distractions to that storyline that it was frustrating. I think the book would be half the size if it would stick to the investigation (it IS a murder mystery, isn't it?) Entire chapters were spent pining over his ex-wife, his shrink appointments and his drinking and his new girlfriend (a very promiscuous high school principal??? pul-ease!) A lot of unnecessary foul language (even the principal), gratuitous sex and alcohol abuse. And that's just the hero of the story! Even the underaged prostitution that Jesse was investigating didn't bother me as much as the rest of it did. If it hadn't been a library book, I would have thrown it in the trash. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it 
 My 3 dogs recently start fighting and was frantic about what to do since they live inside with me 24/7. I had fights that landed one of my dogs in the ER room so this was a serious problem. I  have obedience trained all my dogs so I am not a novice. I   heard this author on the local radio station where I live and thought his book may be helpful. It was not. It is very basic stuff I already knew. I found Patricia McConnell, PH.D.'s 30 page pamphlett "The Cautious Canine"to be much more helpful than this author's 230 page book. If your problem is strickly aggression and or fearful shy dogs then this book does not address enough detail about what to do.  I think it may be a good book for any new or inexperienced dog owner that covers basics. I have since restored peace in my house with some new ground rules and appointing the right dog to alpha status so it can be done 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 The 5 star ratings could only have come from hardcore Lynch fans. This movie is absolutely unwatchable from start to finish. I am a longtime student of film, but have absolutely no clue what this movie is about. I challenge anyone who is not a lynch fan to comprehend this film. I have enjoyed most of Lynch's past work, but in lost highway I get the impression that he was trying too hard 
 No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records ("Most Overrated Celebrity").  If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book?  So dies a noble institution

 Good cast, adaptation of King Lear. Don't bother unless you are really bored 
 When I read Medicine Woman I taken aback at how it possibly could have convinced anyone that it was anything other than a mildly absurd romance.  Still, not being a native person or living in Manitoba, where the events of the novel take place, I thought it presumptuous of me to offer judgement on the events related in this work.  A quick search on-line lead to me the Canadian Journal of Native Studies, who reviewed Andrews' work when it first came out,  but here is a small taste of what the Manitoba native community thought of her work:  '... the novel reaches its misinformed heights when the narrator arrives in Canada.  True to a Californian's perception of Manitoba, the narrator steps off a plane in Winnipeg and sets off across " the Canadian tundra."  The time is year is supposedly spring, yet Andrews describes the "grand rolling fields" where "green grasses twisted and curled in the wind" (p.21)  Prairie grass does not get long enough to blow in the breeze until July, which means that the narrator either does not know what season it is, or believes that it is cold enough on the "tundra" at all seasons to justify her "sweaters, wool socks, and flannel pajamas." 	Andrews' first encounter with the Cree in Crowley typifies her misguided and often insulting perception of native people.  Throughout the book, the natives treat her with indifference, insult, or degradation, and the narrator is either too slow-witted, or too taken with the esoteric nature of her experiences to realize it.  Although supposedly a reserve town, Crowley is just like all the Western towns in Hollywood movies.  It consists of some houses and a "Trading Post" full of "brown round-faced children eating Hostess cupcakes."  All the adults are dressed in cowboy clothes because they are roping cattle at a Rodeo down the road.  The Manitoba Cree undoubtedly practice cattle roping during the summer when their trap lines are inactive, although Andrews has not suggested what they would use for cattle in the black spruce and muskeg marsh lands in which most of them live.' 	The directions which Andrews obtains from the Indians at the Trading Post are sufficiently vague so that she does not know whether to follow the road or to search for Agnes Whistling Elk up on the "Black Mesa."  It is not surprising, therefore, that Andrews is unable to find either Agnes or a geographical feature which does not exist in Manitoba.'[...]  
 I rate this CD 2 stars solely off Bun B's verse on Kodak Moment (RMX). He flows that hard. Everything else: is trash.  This is a very weak CD and the fact that it is CONTENT PROTECTED easily make this CD the worst in my collection. Sad 
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 This author is just in it for the money, very poor book 
 What can you call a woman with a Bryn Mawr education who makes fun of a 10th grade drop out from the south because he, like about half of the other people from his socio-economic background, mispronounces the word "ask" as "axe"...?   An arrogant idiot!  And one who knowingly and for profit perpetrated an indelible stain on an American tragedy, and further muddied the waters for future researchers.  And unlike contemporary audiences of this unfortunate work, the modern reader now has access to the knowledge that both McMillian and her husband have been exposed as known CIA assets and propagandists.  This book is a good way to waste 6-8 hours of your life that you can never get back, is based on what the writer knew to be bald-faced lies, and is presented in an insultingly smug manner.   This book isn't worth the matches it would take to set it on fire. 
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I started reading the book anticipating a great mystery/detective novel, However, it first took me some time to get into it(about half way) and I still found it to be a dry read. I was expecting a page turning, exciting and mysterious book, but instead I found that the parts of the book that were meant to be exciting and mysterious, would be boring and found myself dosing off. A good book makes you stay up, regardless of how tired you actually are. I will give Mr. Kellerman the benefit of the doubt and will read another book by him, but I definately cannot say I loved this book. It was a very dry read.. 
 We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift.  What a nightmare.  First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better.  This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it.  It cuts NOTHING.  This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch.  There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together.  We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking!  The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING.  My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic. 
 This Book's focus seemed to be more about justifying Bill Gates' actions, and defending Microsoft against negative PR than the actual history of Microsoft.  A more fact-filled, play-by-play history of the rise of Microsoft would have been more interesting, I think 
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 Before you pick up this "novel", please read a biography of Jerzy Kosinski's life by author James Park Sloan --Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography. In 1982, Kosinski was completely discredited by the Village Voice for fabricating his auto-biographical, The Painted Bird, and for plagarism found in his most of his other books. He slandered an entire nation (Poland) in The Painted Bird even though he was actually saved by Polish Catholics and lived in safety during the duration of the war. Instead of writing what was a true war experience he decided that shock and brutality would give him more notariety. He became rich and won countless awards and accolades for his damaging lies.  Before he committed suicide in 1991 he tried to make amends for the damage he caused to the Poles but it was too late. The Painted Bird has been deemed a "truth" and has been included on the reading lists of many Holocaust Study Courses.  I feel sorry for the Poles -- that this work produced by a sick, deviant and demented pathalogical liar could be taken as a true experience --it's like spitting on the graves of all those, Jews and Poles alike,that died in the hands of the Nazis during WWII.  It is a terrible injustice 
 Sometime during the 1960's, William F. Buckley sardonically observed that it was disgraceful the way that this country makes the Kennedys fight for the throne.  In 2003, Buckley offered an interesting 40 year past retrospective on the Kennedy presidency - its legacy was entirely personal.  Kennedy accomplished nothing that was singular and enduring in effect and in fact had his share of NEGATIVE accomplishments.  He is venerated today only because of his physical beauty.  Buckley might have been anticipating this book, but he never would have had the heart to say or even to think to question the utility of women's suffrage in a television age - let alone to recognize the danger that it poses.  This book by Gretchen Rubin (how can you doubt a name like this?  Are parents still naming their kids "Gretchen"?) might inadvertently highlight that danger.  It makes a half-hearted attempt to be an objective analysis of the Kennedy presidency and of Kennedy as a human being, and I'll even give the authoress a modicum of credit for rejecting conspiratorial explanations for the homicide.  But in the end, this book reads like a cross between one of those shallow post-Camelot soft-soaping kiddie books (anyone remember "Meet John F. Kennedy" by Nancy Bean White?) and a diary that might have been written by a circa-1959 bobby soxer screeching at the top of her lungs while watching JFK emerge half-naked from the ocean and onto the beach.  After giving her readers various perspectives on JFK, the authoress, Gretchen Rubin, - who claims to be a historian - weighs in with her own opinion that JFK really was a great president.  Why?  Uh - because he was so dreamy.  William F. Buckley really IS a genius!  You had to give them the vote.  Truth to tell though, public fascination with JFK is its infatuation with personal charm and physical appeal to the complete exclusion of substance and character.  And it represents a failing of democracy as a whole, not just of women's suffrage.  The GW Bush presidency, though, might help historians more savvy than Ms. Rubin get a better handle on the JFK presidency.  The GW Bush presidency might actually be a matching Republican book-end to the Kennedy presidency.  Both the GW Bush and Kennedy White Houses were Tinker Toys bought for a spoiled brat to play with.  Both individuals came to power with a pachydermous skin and a hubris stemming from dynastic ambitions.  Both presidents led this country into tragic military conflict.  More parallels could undoubtedly be found, but the point is that after the ashes of the Bush presidency have been swept away, some people might actually notice these parallels and rethink the Kennedy presidency - and maybe even recognize the dangers inherent in a president assuming office under the rationale of the divine right of kings 
 Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy 
 I have to start with the fact that this is, in fact, an outstanding story and concept. The idea and plot are solid and the characters interesting. However that is where the book falls apart. The Story is great but the writing is atrocious. I have seen better writing from kids in the 6'th grade. Either Mr. Swanwick is off his A.D.D. medication or he needs to get on some, and FAST!. The storyline jumps around frantically, there is virtually NO character development short of the main two and even they are pathetically "explained". The "species" and "Classes" are left to be assumed as to their place in the world woven for us. Unless you are a fantasy "buff" you would never understand 3/4 of the phrases used. The mix of lower level writing interwoven with PHD level words and explanations of scientific theories interwoven with magical power is beyond mind bending when you try to shift gears between S.A.T. words and ideas of scientific theory and fantasy troll vs troll with arms getting ripped off as insane porographic sex with some pedophile overtones is occuring right next to it.   My review is hard enough to follow, the book is 5 times worse. I will never disgrace my expansive library with a book of this authors again.  
 It is very repetative and over simplified. He does make his point, then again, then again. While his one point was interesting, it's not worth the book. I read this book a few years back. Now that I have been more involved in the market, I can say that the book has contributed nothing to my experience. 
 I was very disappointed in this book about the great Margot.  Was it really necessary to put in all the salacious details of her sex life in order to give us a picture of her career and life?  I think a little more restraint on the part of the author was definitely in order.  I wanted to learn more about the ballerina's career on stage, not especially about what she did in bed and what her sexual prowess was.  I agree with the lady who said she would not recommend this book to her daughter, the budding ballerina as I thought the 'so-called' sex information on La Fontaine was tasteless and over the top. 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 How Does Catherine Coulter continue to get these awful books published?  Does ANYONE read this stuff before it goes into print?  I've been reading historical romances for 20 years, and this is, without a doubt, the worst reading experience I've ever had!  The flat characters and convoluted story line were bad enough, but the ridiculous, dithering, twit headed dialogue that has become Ms. Coulter's hallmark of late, aggravated me so much that I read not even half of this book before I threw it across the room in disgust!  Mad Jack is much worse (if you can believe it) than Coulter's recycled regencies that she keeps revisiting on the world, and quite frankly, I feel that this book is not worth the paper it's printed on 
 It wasn't very good, either. The gist of the book is this:  "I had this surgery for mostly cosmetic reasons (aka vanity) and now that I am thin, my life is perfect! Oh, and by the way, my husband is very rich and I get to eat out at fancy restaurants and travel a lot. And I mean a LOT."  I agree with the reviewers who thought the author glossed over the struggles and suffering many gastric bypass patients face, making it sound like life post-surgery is all cake (sugar-free, of course) and roses. I also agree that this author is positively obsessed with food. I am a post-rny patient and cannot yet eat even half of the meals she describes so rapturously.  The only reason I gave it two stars is that I read it right before my surgery (although, I must mention, this was AFTER I had already made the decision to have it; this book is too one-sided to help with the surgery decision-making process) and it really psyched me up for my surgery and made me feel very upbeat about it. So in that respect, it did have a small amount of value for me. 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.

 This book was on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list for 17 weeks before that newspaper (April 1992) felt compelled to run a FRONT PAGE story explaining that "Chief Seattle" never spoke the words attributed to him in this book.  Only one kind of reader will care, those who love the truth.  Others (read Liberals and God-haters) will have no problem with this book, which is why it still sells well. Read all about this subterfuge in Reader's Digest July 1993, volume 143, issue 855 pages 100 to 104. 
 I thought this would be more of a how-to for prospective writers, but it ends up being more of a treatise of sex as a whole, not how to write about it and make it interesting. You're better off reading Dr. Ruth, who is at least entertaining. This was dry, dull and borin 
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 The book is well presented but lot of the coverage is very ambiguous and situational to real railroading not focused onthe aspects of model railroading. I would have expected to see more coverage of layout building, tips and trick, experiences from fellow modelers, but none of that kind to suit my pallate. Rather dissappointed, I must say 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 Bought this book as a spinoff to a seminar hoping for some insight into a complex subject. The common cause made between ineffectual clergy of the late 18th century and American women was interesting, but then the author lost herself (and her theme) in her exhausting review of obscure, forgettable literature. The phrase "deadly dull" comes to mind.    The book is more notable for what it does not address than for what it does.   
 WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. PURCHASED THIS BOOK FOR MATH EDU COLLEGE CLASS AND IT WAS USELESS AND VERY OVERPRICED 
 I feel I should preface by saying that I love this band to death. However, For Fans Only is pretty shoddy. Every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect. That being said, it's not without merit. I just wish it had been put together better 
 I bought this book thinking it was going to briefly spell out what I already know--that our advertising-soaked world is toxic--and then get to the heart of the matter: what I personally could do to make my own life saner. It did not do that. It was mostly a diatribe against "the way the world is today" and how "things were better in the old days."  Well, hold the phone, because (a)Things aren't 100% hellish now and (b)The world is no worse than it ever was, it's just crummy in a different way. This is one great argument that IT IS IMPERATIVE TO KNOW YOUR HISTORY! So here goes:  Life up till the 1950s was not all one big back-to-nature love-in. Most people have been unable to build a fire without using matches since at least the Industrial Revolution. Nobody but an idiot would have drunk from a stream in the Middle Ages; the water was polluted (albeit with feces rather than mercury), and that's why they all guzzled ale instead. Life on the land basically meant you were one crop away from starvation and you worked yourself pretty much to death just to get by. And if you want to talk about long hours and fast paces, how about 7-year-olds toiling in textile factories and mines for 12 to 15 hours a day--less than a century ago?  Yes, we are inundated with advertising to a ridiculous degree. And yes, it breeds cynicism. And yes, the levels of noise and chatter have become deafening. These are Bad Things. But the book really doesn't give any positive steps for turning these things down in your own life...and I thought that was the point? I can bemoan the state of the world quite well on my own; what I want is some ideas other people have tried that worked. Like another reviewer, I'm hoping for a sequel that would deal with these things--plus not leave me so depressed I want to stick my head in the oven. Maybe it could be titled: *Okay, the Sky's Not Falling, Let's Lighten Up* 
 This unit will not fit all lighter sockets.  I've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife's Saab 9-3.  The 33185 version does fit 
 Unfortunately, not much good to say.  I ordered this book with great anticipation, given my familiarity with the European and Middle Eastern high-end property markets.  The title lends itself to expecting a sense of a dynamic portrayal of the true passion, power and property of Manhattan.  However, the book read like stale bread.  I could almost smell the mothballs and the pungent cedar scent of the endless characters who are from an age gone by.  Where is the extended perspective and insight into the more recent property upheaval, the characters behind the scenes who pull the strings and truly make things happen.    Instead, were are taken through the hallowed halls of bygone era that smacks of a quasi-historical view of Manhattan's historical roots.  Why stop at going as far back as the 19th Century?  Perhaps Gaines would have done best to investigate the true Dutch and pilgrim roots of New York City.  When taking us into the present, or at least the recent past, there is only a very limited perspective of the very top 1% of the players, the movers and the shakers.  There is no intermixing of the various industries that together help shape the property market, nor of the machinations that inevitably get lost amidst the official stories that tend to make it to the social pages of the newspapers.  As a last note, Gaines, has failed to write a compelling book, written in an engaging manner that incites the reader to read further, with the excitement of getting a glimpse at the true Passion of Property in Manhattan.  Gaines has written a bland account that reads more like a tired summary of dates, events, names, and buildings 
 I contacted amazon when I found out it was sent to my old address but they said they could not help me.I had to stop payment on it 
 The book title is completely mis-leading. It has little info on administrate the server - little practical details. I regret I bought it, because I was looking for info to "manage" MySQL 
 Virtual History, edited by Niall Ferguson, was, quite frankly, a disappointment.  The premise of the book was to explore possible histories for counterfactuals based on actions that were considered by the actors at the time, thus eliminating many of the more far-fetched possibilities.  The editor is the author of some excellent books on especially economic history; "The Pity of War" is especially worthy of the reader's attention.  However, in my opinion "Virtual History" misses the mark.  After a rather ponderous ninety page introduction, there is a series of chapters on various periods, more history than virtual history and remarkably parochial in their outlook.  Certainly English readers would be much more interested than the rest of us regarding such subjects as what would have ensued if the English king Charles I had kept his throne, or if a home rule for Ireland bill were passed in the English parliament in 1912.  In fact, one wonders why this particular book was published in the U.S.  It is hoped that in the future, Ferguson will turn his very considerable talents back to what he does best:  ecooonomic history 
 Only "Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe" survives....  Judy overplays and the only thing worth mentioning besides the titlesegment is Virginia O`Brien...   To me - this film doesn`t exist in my collection of Judy Garland items.. 
 Skip this one.  It's horrible.  I bought it just before a long flight and didn't have anything else to read.  "I chose poorly."  What kind of author involves his political views and disdain for Christianity in a book called Big Weather?  Well, Mark Svenvold does.  For your money, you get a big dose of Svenvold's personal philosophies packaged with a backdrop of high brow cultural references.  Who is this guy?  And, why should we listen to his rambling pontifications?  I thought I was buying a book about Big Weather!!  Svenvold is also extremely insulting.  He describes one fellow he met as having a receding hairline comparing it to a glacier retreating.  Come now!  Was that necessary?  Oklahomans in particular get an extra helping of insults.  Svenvold lets loose with unflattering comments about a number of individuals.  Most of them were just answering his questions about weather.  Here is a small dose.  Svenvold describes a college student storm chaser: "She had an oval face, a smallish mouth, and large, wide cheekbones that made her look as if she were peering shyly and a little fiercely out from behind a tribal mask, if such a mask wore mascara."  It gets worse.  That is just one I turned to quickly.  Save your money.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  I have no idea how it managed the ratings is has received.  Still tempted?  Pick it up in a bookstore and read pages 232-237 (soft cover).  If that strikes you as an exciting read about "big weather" then go for it.  This book is for you 
 After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap "shocks" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry "Mom!" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major dispointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I liked that they included so many artists, and had some good interview questions asked.. in that way it seems a bit like a magazine more than an actual art criticism book.  But I'd have to agree with one of the other comments about the quality not doing it justice.  Many of the art pieces are rendered in a way that does makes the colors look dark and the detail gets lost.  I guess it's considered cheap for an art book, but for me, it was an investment, I surely can't afford the art and I can barely afford to buy a $30 book, and I was so excited at the time I bought it.  Just wanted to help make sure nobody gets disappointed like I did 
 The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.  If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.    There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters 
 It is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better item  Light and not providing the warmth expected from this price level.  Feels incomplet 
 I didn't realize when I bought this that it is not really an adult-geared book. The stories are very short and written in very elementary terms, apparently targeted at children. Left me wanting more information about the animals 
 This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess 
 The author can't even be bothered to correct Rowling's birthdate in this "revised and updated" edition!!!  It's a *biography* and he doesn't even have the subject's birthdate correct.  Sean Smith's biography of Rowling is far superior.  This one shouldn't even be on the market, and I can't fathom why large chains are stocking it.  
 I bought 20 stocks with Greenblatt's list.  Two quarters later i have lost 25 percent of my capital.  Of the 20 stocks i picked from his list, only 8 are now on his list 5 months later!!!  Wow!! What changed with his numbers SO quickly?  Watch out for the Hussler!!  You would think that Greenblatt already has enough money and wouldn't need to milk the consumer anymore with yet another book 
 I can't believe this was a Lifetime movie.It does make us wonder about Linda Hamilton's post-Terminator career choices.She's no Sarah Connor,future mother of mankind's savior,but a mousy journalist investigating Jacqueline Bisset,who may or may not be a madam.Linda Hamilton seems to be discomfitted in this movie,and with its awful script,it's no wonder why.  Jacqueline Bisset plays a Frenchwoman who combines the Professor from "My Fair Lady" with the campiness of Mame.She's being campy&clearly enjoying it.  Linda Hamilton is "transformed" from being an ugly American to an erotic Mademoiselle through buying lingerie,having a loooong dressing room sequence&watching pornos.Having a fling with a hot photographer apparently perks her up too.  This movie makes good for early morning watching (say 4 am,before going to work?),and it makes for good campy fun.If you're having a Bad Movie Night,put this on your list,have some French rose wine&chow down on chocolate croissants!  "Sex&Mrs.X" is hardly an epic,but it's a PERFECT GUILTY PLEASURE 
 I purchased this book because I am interested in environmental issues and I saw a favorable newspaper review.  I found Ms. Royte's style so rambling, long-winded, and anecdotal that it was difficult to stay focussed for the kernels of real information that occasionally popped up.  And now I feel badly for the energy wasted and trees harvested on account of my purchase. 
 I bought 2 of these at the store 3 years ago and was so excited to find them here on Amazon so I bought 2 more.  The previous ones lastd about a year with daily use, but the two I purchase on Amazon burned out within a month.  The first one only lasted a week.  Maybe a bad batch?  I dont know but I don't think I will take a chance again.  I am lucky to have kept an old one and have pieced together a working model.  Beware!  I'm out $40.  Don't let this happen to you! 
 I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them.  This isn't one of those cases.  I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced.  I bought this book with lots of anticipation.  I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents.  After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book.  Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts.  I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation.  Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR.  Those would be "The Jesus I Never Knew" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and "Disappointment with God" (Which also was spectacular).  If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's.  As for "Reaching the Invisible God," I wouldn't buy it 
 This band is more punk than rock with only somewhat easy flowing songs 
 Do not buy this CD, it's terrible.  One of the biggest mistakes I ever made is buying this CD...it is now a coaster 
 This poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of Sister North. In the end, we really don't care if she ever returns. The ending is cliched and predictable. A waste of time 
 I think the director needs prozac to direct this movie, the whole plot is so mess up, junior high student can write better story than this..what was he thinking. don't waste your money buying this movi 
 Unfortunately you shipped me a Region 1 version when I am clearly in UK, Region2. you then shipped a FOC replacement, again Region1 you then offered me a refund if I paid to ship them back to you, as I have not been able to view either copy and cannot give you a better "review"  
 I can't believe they sell such a piece of c...p! After inserted the 9V battery, I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time, and I heard a cracking noise right away. One piece of the mechanism fell off, and I could hear it when shaking the box. Of course, the shuffler was broken... Wished I could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c...p in some store 
 Well, with the kind of judgmental attitude Barbara Johnson has toward others different from herself, she's going down to the fiery place.  And fast.  For the record, Christian = Acceptance, not Christian = Intolerance 
 Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this movie! And I'm a big fan of Tim Burton and his visuals. But this book doesn't accentuate either of the above. The illustrations are not very exciting and the book lacks tons of actual still photos and behind the scenes shots. At least I got it for free. I was hoping for something similar to the Bram Stoker's Dracula book that came out shortly after that film. That book and script was exceptional and captured the full beauty of the movie. This one (though the script is included) does not do the same. A shame because I love this film

 The title says it all. I have tried to get this product three times from three sources and each time it ends up back ordered and eventually not available at all. I would love to review it because I have actually read it : 
 I own the Olympus FE-100 Digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). I switched to Energizer Batteries and bought an Energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. It's not a quick charger like this one, but I say for less than half the investment, I've got a charger that does the job. I would NOT spend this kind of money on a charger. So I say, if you're part of the "gotta have it now" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. Otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 First listen: " What?...Just "My favourite Game" is good? no, here must be another good song" Second: "Ok, now i know this is a waste of time" third: " Do you believe" "Junk of the Hearts" " Erase/Rewind" and maybe just maybe "Paralized" could be so-so tracks. CONCLUSION: I want my money back. The entired cd is so slow, calm, and i was waiting some strong tracks, whit fast rythms...but i got this. Nina Person ( The blond singer) have a nice voice, but whit this album i was fooled like a tourist in a foreing land 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b    roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk  i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one 
 While "Talk to the Hand" is inescapably mediocre in comparison to "Eats, Shoots & Leaves", a book I found amusing, though not up-to-par to its New York Times Bestseller status, this book does have its moments.   However, I was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of Lynne Truss in presuming to make a comment that, despite whatever way she meant it, ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice. I find it interesting that she, or at least her editors, did not further investigate the disease (which, indeed, gluten tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark.   Oh, yes, bloody well sorry, Ms. Truss, for invading your rude, stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which, I'm sure, someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet. Let's just go and, well, obliterate a genetic disorder! While we're at it, we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. If it pleases and thanks you, Ms. Truss, we celiacs will eat cake. (Oh, bloody hell, did I just say "please"?)  Despite the fact that Lynne Truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, I have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. In explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be quite rude, as well. It is not simply the celiac remark to which I refer: I also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid shouts at his mother, "I want that one, YOU EFFING BITCH!", among others, a bit offensive.  As a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness, I was often thoroughly appalled by this book. No, my friends and I don't usually hold doors for each other, but, in general, I thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. Frankly, I find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. I can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them.  I have to argue that we are not a select group. In today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. Ms. Truss, I believe, would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to be. If she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior.  My last complaint is this: "gluten crap"? You would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as Lynne Truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year, am-I-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word "crap. 
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 I am a family member of one of victims and I am offended by the inside thoughts into the crimes and the personal thoughts of the victims and of the offender. There is NO way that the authors could have privy to the thoughts and feelings of the victims and am offended by what was written about our loved ones.  Mustasfa did not speak and obtain permission from all family members to be included in her book. I find the publication to be offensive to all of the victims and added unnecessary stress to those close to the victims.  I would not recommend purchase of this book 
 He is a wonderful researcher; thorough and accurate. His reporting begins to fall apart in c. 1750 and becomes spectacular journalism; intended to sell the book rather than add to knowledge. The book started well but soon turned into a slog. Took almost six weeks for this reader to finish a 1 - 2 week book. A total liberal agenda when I was led to expect balance. Sigh. No stars is not a choice but misleadings like this deserve such. Ra 
 This book offers absolutely NOTHING NEW about how best to deal with people.  You can get much more from an article in Workforce magazine or even Fast Company.  Hire the best people you can afford and then let them be who you hired them to be.  If you want some good advice about dealing with employees, check out "Love 'Em or Lose 'Em," a classic 
 The second half of the book is a neverending parade of cartoon violence.  The cast begins to blur and fade together as our hero suffers one beating/shooting/injury after another but keeps on going with the help of an occasional percocet instead of three weeks in the hospital.  By the end I had lost track of who was doing what to whom and for what reason.  Improbable coincidences pile up and let the hero's pursuers track him down against all odds.  I think I read and enjoyed the author's first book but this one was like finishing a dull assignment.  It was a chore to read at the end.   
 Unfortunately a well-intentioned author provides just another "me too" guide, which includes all the persistent misconceptions about the role of diet in IBS-D; D&C; and C subpopulations. Clearly not current with the literature and does not understand the processing of benign antigens by the gastroimmune system nor the process of oral tolerance (which is compromised in this condition leading to the symptoms). As with any of these books, authors do not yet understand the fact that to achieve a high-rate and significant degree of remission the diet must be patient-specific. This cannot be accomplished with the procedures recommended much less with the dietary advice provided. Probabilities dictate that you are bound to find some people who experience some relief from some of the recommendations, and many people who receive little relief. Some will experience worsening of their symptoms. IBS patients will be consuming foods and additives left and right which perpetuate their symptoms using these types of books for guidance which is well out of date 
 We bought this because the same series had extremely thorough, excellent "The Everything Bible Book" written by a Catholic priest. This "everything" Catholic book is lacking in detail and accuracy and omits Adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. For religious vocations  the authors never mention that today's growing religious orders (priest, sisters,nuns, brothers and consecrated) receiving a multitude of novices are the traditional faithful. There is one mention of World Youth Day which is a 2 decades phenomena, not just an entry for the year 2002 "in Toronto to raise interest in vocations". Under the topic "The call to holiness" is the heading 'the priesthood' which ignores constant church teaching that each person is called to holiness regardless of his or her vocation in life. There's one "E" alert to the effect that many Catholic lay people complain that they are not heard by the upper levels of the church. The fact that Rev. Curran is made an "E" alert under "Catholic Universities" for publicly protesting the Church's unwavering teaching on contraception (which all Christians held to until 1930 with the Anglican Lamberth decision) shows the reader that the authors prefer to highlight heretics rather than actual Catholic doctrine and faith. Can't recall seeing the word 'faith' more than once, nor Blessed Sacrament. Scripture references are rare (maybe 3) and zero references to the current Catechism of the Catholic Church, although a brief mention is made that there exist throughout history 'catechisms'. Regarding women's ordination you will be informed that the topic today is "hotly debated" and many women have been better trained than priests. These examples show that opinions offset details and facts in this book although many details are provided with simple accuracy. There are several errors, unrelated to the fact that both authors are Canadian, such as: "The genuflection is made toward the 'monstrance' which holds the communion bread and wine", a way of honoring Christ's presence in the church. Correction: a monstrance is centrally located on the altar in the church  during Adoration and Benediction and neither devotion is mentioned in this book. What the authors meant was 'Tabernacle' and no explanation is given to which much should have to explain the significance linking the Old Testament holy of holies, manna,the priest Melkezidech and his sacrifice of bread and wine, and the Passover with Christ's New Covenant, Holy Eucharist and Tabernacle. The Catechism of the Catholic Church and "Why do Catholics do That" would be much better books for the topic of all things Catholic. 
 The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as "Charlie" as though he was the cop on "Bad Boys" who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously  done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him.   In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat  down.  Wierd !  Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each  page is different and a unique attempt at truth.   Shows too how the  Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of  value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive 
 Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology.  This book doesn't say too much.  For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book.  It will be a waste of your money.  For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this.  If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy 
 We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well. 1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag. 2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic? 3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant 
 A high-school kid could make up a better story.  Watch out for the Liger!  Part Lion part Tige 
 I will be brief: Penroses writing is mediocre, his drawings obfuscate more than clarify. The vast majority of the book is devoted to completely and utterly extraneous topics, and seems to largely be a platform for Penroses new quantum theories. His arguments are unclear, weak and largely dependent on philosphers like Lucas and Searle, while his idea of quantum effects is improbable and surely in the end irrelevant (cannot computers tap into quantum effects?) and his knowledge of computer science deeply, deeply suspect. For example, I quote here from the final sections which actually have something to do with his ostensible reason for writing the book:  "Neverthless, one still might imagine some kind of natural selection process being effective for producing approximately valid algorithms. Personally, I find this very hard to believe, however." The entire flourishing, commercially succesful field of evolutionary computing begs to differ here, Mr. Penrose. SUch bonehead errors compells me to point out that this mathematician has no clothes 
 Pedestrian, insipid, and banal are all descriptives with more life than what is encountered in this collection of bleh.    It's unfortunate that the author applied his wonderful writing style to expertly strip all sense of humanity and intelligence from his characters, deciding instead that every represention and encounter be woven from identical nothingness.  After reading Barrel Fever I was left with a nagging feeling that I had been witness to little more than the kidnap of many perfectly innocent words for the ransom of a contracted book release. 
 It made little notable difference or improvement. I would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious. 
 I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  The pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers.  I would be upset to find this in a school library.  This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old. 
 This band is horrible.  Not 'rock and roll' at all.  Talentless.  The organ player is the most obnoxious, amateur piece of garbage ever.  Don't waste your money on this, seriously.  
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story.  When I had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to DVD format, I was thrilled. And then I bought the DVD, and to my dismay, within the first couple of minutes into the movie, there were white lines and distortion. Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV. And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound. It's very harsh and nasally. I am on my way out the door to return this DVD and ask for a refund. 
 Seems like Kurupt duz really good with out DDDDDaz!  Throw Back Muzic'86 was the only good hit on this whole Death Row Album, and you can't even sample it!?  Like Eazy, "I be like Scrappy Loco, cause Kurupt be yellin' Long Beach Rollin' 6-0 Blood & Puppy Pound Crip? Really Doe!  Nutz On Ya Chin, All Up in this Philly Hoe!" -Eazy-E (Wut Would U Do?)  Anywayz, Against The Grain really is watered down compared to Kurupt's previous albums!  Death Row Records present day, Petey Pablo (Blast!), Young Eastwood (Blast!), Suga Knight (Blast!), and that wanna be Locc Kurupt (Blast! Blast!), he was never 2pac's friend like Snoop Doggy Dogg was anywayz!  Plus MC Eiht, Outlawz, Coolio, RBX and Kurupts old' partner DDaz has better solo albums than Kurupt!  This album is a disgrace to West Coast hip hop, so ya know whats good for ya! (LOL! 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, has been awarded France's Legion d'Honneur, Italy's Grinzane Cavour and was inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 2002. "Veronika Decides to Die" is his twelfth book and was first published in 1998.    The story begins in late 1997 and follows the story of Veronika - a twenty four year old woman living in Slovenia. The book begins with her attempted suicide : however, having overdosed on tranquilisers, she is discovered in time and taken to hospital before she dies. The hospital in question is Vilette - a well known asylum in Ljubljana. Although she has survived, she is told - due to the damage the tranquilisers have done to her heart - she only has about a week to live. Having always kept herself firmly under control, Veronika finds herself broadening her range of experiences and feelings, and gradually comes to see her life as something worth living. Her arrival in Vilette also has an impact on some of the asylum's other patients - specifically, Eduard (a schizophrenic), Zedka (who suffers from depression) and Mari (who suffers from panic attacks).   This is an absolutely awful book : rather than "beautiful", "poetic" or "inspiring", I've never found writing so bland. Despite her situation, Coelho finds himself incapable of establishing any empathy with or sympathy for Veronika. In fact, I even think he wrote about the wrong character - Zedka's story, in the hands of an author up to the task, is a story I'd rather have heard. Coelho's decision to include himself in the story stank of ego, and the way that he wrote that section ("Paulo Coelho wanted to know all the details of what had happened" rather than "I wanted to know all the details of what had happened") was really irritating. The only apparent hobby the patients had - a solitary pastime known to some as 'merchant banking' - was given too high a profile : Veronika's activities on this front were irrelevant and did nothing to help the story. Then again, Coelho has spent some time in an asylum as a patient - perhaps he knows something I don't. Unfortunately, he just doesn't seem capable of putting what he knows into words : avoid this book at all costs. 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 I reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the Sinatra version in an earlier issue. How does the update stand up?   Well, once they moved the setting to Iraq, cleaned up the muddy surrealism, sobered up the star, and played it straight, there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message. Like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake. Or Chinese cinema. "We will tell you what to think." The locals might mistake it for a documentary. I quit watching after 30 minutes.   You just can't carry an entire movie with a "fake war hero via hypnosis" plot. No movie should hinge on a single plot point, and if it does, please don't make it a boring one. No disrespect to Denzel Washington intended. He played Frank Sinatra so well that co-producer Tina Sinatra probably got goosebumps. And what a waste of Meryl Streep. She did a great job and it didn't matter.   But hey, one of the beauties of watching DVDs in China is that I don't blow three hours' pay on each movie.   As a brief aside, show ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to 155 Chinese students. This film refuses to tell them what to think, and that confuses the hell out of them. Then they ask you, Mr. Teacher Person, to explain the film's message. Um, it's about your school, but I'm not saying that.    
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 I bought this book because I'd read and enjoyed some of Alexandra Robbins' others.  But man, was this one boring.  Slow moving.  Repetitive.  You get the picture.  I couldn't even finish it.  Of course, for a book airing the views of twentysomethings, I guess I shouldn't have been expecting dazzling insights or anything.  As an age group, judging from this book, it appears we don't really have much to say for ourselves, sigh.  The sorority one and the Yale secret society one were much more interesting 
 Sir Leycester Coltman was Head of the Foreign Office's Latin America Department, then Ambassador to Cuba (1991-94), then to Colombia (1994-98). But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.   This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.   Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.  He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.  Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.   He warned, "Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head."  
 that people could read this book and not be the least bit suspicious or inquisitive about the sources of a man who writes for a right wing publication, "Human Events." Even the subtitle, "That Undermine the War on Terror," is speculative for which the author provides no explanation while suggesting sedition by Americans opposed to the war. That alone, is heavy-handed.  There are two contentions that I would like to address from this book: Haliburton is not profiting from their contracts in Iraq, and 2) Iraq really did have WMD's.  If Halliburton is barely making ends meet with its open-ended, no-bid contract, then don't they owe it to their shareholders to pull out of Iraq toward more profit-making ventures? Shouldn't their board of directors be thrown out? Has anyone bothered to check Halliburton's northward stock march since 2003? A look at Ameritrade from Aug 06 to July 06 shows that the company has almost doubled it's price share!  It's hard to imagine a company cannot make money after being forgiven a $60 million dollar penalty for overcharging the government for things like $45 for a case of coca-cola, or $100 for a bag of laundry, or underfeeding our troops at Halliburton-run messhalls? Haven't they been charging the government for feeding the regiment three squares a day, seven days a week? So, whose running this company into the ground anyway, and leaving it awash in red ink?   Now, for the author's proof that there were WMD's in Iraq:  If we really did discover weapons of mass destruction, as Miniter claims, wouldn't this administration have trumpeted this information worldwide? How come even they are admitting that WMD's don't exist, and never did? Even the US Army Chemical Corps stated the chemicals they found, which Miniter proclaims as proof, were just chemicals and not chemical weapons. The sarin was so degraded from age, it would have been wholly ineffective. The low grade uranium was already bagged and tagged by the U.N. years earlier. Incidentally a lot of countries have that amount of uranium. Does that mean they are making WMD's, and are we going to invade them too?  It was tough reading this when I suspected that Miniter was clutching anecdotal straws to reinforce his preconceived beliefs. His work and sources will not withstand serious scrutiny. He had made numerous factual gaffes, an indication of careless editing and miniscule research. And he uses inductive reasoning to draw his conclusions.  Judging by some of his five star reviews, it's obvious that his conclusions matched his readers' expectations. It's unlikely however, a reader will challenge what he or she already wants to believe.  Mr. Miniter, just because lemons are yellow, and your car may be yellow, doesn't prove that your car is a lemon. It only proves that your car has yellow paint 
 this book is for the starters in harmony; there is no jazz here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   "jim jim" and "first things first", you are completely right 
 Robert Wiene's "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.  Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.  In a strange way, one can look upon "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" as a bizarre version of "The Wizard of Oz" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.   
 I think i must restate my previous review- how long have you been listening to metal? (and paying attention to song structures? 
 While this book touches on many truths regarding emotionally abused women and thier abusers, it starts from a flawed premise. That premise being that ALL emotionally abused women were abused as children in one way or another and that is why the woman choses abusive partners and even friends all through her life. Not ALL women who are emotionally abused come from an abusive childhood, to say so is an irresponsible commentary on the subject. I find the book "Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men" by Lundy Bancroft a more in depth and on target handling of the subject. 
 Intelligence in Warfare is a simplistic, arguably inaccurate, and often times pompous attempt by noted British historian John Keegan's personal theory that intelligence operations play little part in warfare as a whole.   Some have argued that this book is about how intelligence in but one piece of leadership, but Keegan's arguments refute this rather than support it. To Keegan, intelligence is sometimes crucial, sometimes not, and most of the time just a minor part of a whole. If that is the case, then why write this book? At numerous times in each case study, Keegan observes that the outcome would have been different had the intelligence gathered been acted upon, rather than cast aside. A chapter later he will complain that the intelligence should have been cast aside, and that basing decisions on faulty inteligence caused the defeat. He essentially contradicts himself chapter by chapter.   You can't have it both ways. Though his writing is fluid and poetic as always (Keegan makes the age of sail come alive better than anyone) this book is a prime case of "staying in your lane" of expertise. Intelligence is merely one part of the battle, and rarely tilts the decision one way or another. The challenge of intelligence is recognizing the value of specific bits of information in a sea of speculation. In this case, there are many other books out there on the topic that are worth the expense. 
 The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down!  And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story.  But this one?!  Slow cannot begin to describe it!  What a big disappointment!  
 Even though I am very careful with how I use and store my pots and pans the exterior of this set scratches very easity due to normal use. I store my set in a deep drawer in my new kitchen and removing and replacing these causes the scratches. I am very disappointed in the poor exterior finish and how badly this set looks. I would not buy this set again. I sent a pot back to Meyer for their inspection and am waiting to hear from them. I will probably replace this  set very soon, but not with another Anolon product 
 Certifications are not required and are expensive.  This book heavily advocates certification as a requirement.  I find this misleading and a ploy to get you to pay for added education in mystery shopping.  I was certified and it didn't get me anything.  I finally got a mystery shop job signing up with a few companies that didn't require certification.  
 I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top.  It makes for such a difficult read.  The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here 
 The author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting.  This book lacked substance and depth.  You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court.  It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable.  There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution.  I know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created.  
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 I would have preferred a text that merely reported employers' compliance obligations in an objective manner, rather than portraying employers as the enemy.  I generally found the text to be highly politicized and, to some extent, anti-management.  This book does little to bridge the gap between the business community and academia 
 the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
 For twenty years or longer, Martha Grimes has been one of my favorite mystery writers.  Furthermore, in recent years, particularly in her Emma Graham series, she has emerged as an eloquent and graceful wordsmith.  Her ability to create a mood, from sleepy and laid-back to threatening to comical, with a few well-placed impressionistic brush strokes sets her apart from other writers of the genre.  Unfortunately, her emergence as a word stylist has been more than offset by her decline as a constructor of plots.  There is almost enough of a story line here for an economical, 200-page novel.  Almost.  Unfortunately, what we get is nearly 400 pages with no plot resolution; the story merely proceeds to a point and stops.  I assume that Part 2 will be forthcoming -- for another 20 bucks, of course.  Instead of a completed narrative, we're treated to half a story and a whole boatload of filler.  She gives us one too many performances of "Medea: The Musical." It only works once per book, Ms. Grimes!  Ditto the upstairs visits to alcoholic Aunt Aurora; the cab rides with the moronic Delbert; the trips to the diner in Cold Flat Junction, the musings on what lies beyond the line of trees at the horizon; the put-downs of Ree-Jane; the sabotaging of Miss Bertha's meals; and on and on and on. I often found myself thinking, "Not another one!"  Since Ms. Grimes' latest Richard Jury novel, The Old Wine Shades, suffers from the same defects as Belle Ruin -- no plot resolution and reams of marginally relevant filler -- I conclude that she has made some sort of deal with the devil to serialize her novels.  Furthermore, the multiple editing errors that other reviewers have noted indicate the same thing - that Ms. Grimes is now cranking out her books assembly-line style, a la Tom Clancy.  What a shame.  What a loss 
 I was disappointed in this book. Even though the author succeeds in painting quite a clear canvas of eighteenth-century London's underworld, she fails to make her subject - the two famed criminals - interesting. I didn't find their personalities gripping, or their stories attractive in the least. The narrative is reiterative, the same things being mentioned again and again, and disjointed, lacking cohesiveness. Curiously, the most interesting parts were those which were accessory to the main story, such as the description of the legal system and medical practice. I wouldn't completely dismiss Lucy Moore as a historian, though - she undoubtedly has done a thorough research, and is not totally ungifted as a writer - but I still think this material would have merited a better rendering 
 There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness. The section on fibonocci retracements was useful and seems to work well for me in practice; however, I didn't get much else from the book 
 I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles 
 This is a rudderless work.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why it's so often performed.  It's as if the work were written on commission. Every single act bears the mark of duty.    James Yanni comes close below when he remarks that "there is little to recommend this play that wouldn't likewise recommend almost any of Shakespeare's comedies."  I think the problem, more precisely, is that the devices used to such wonderful effect in Shakespeare's other comedies -- shipwrecks, twins, transvestitism -- are deployed here to no effect at all.  There is not a single sympathetic character in this play.  Everyone is obsessed with either booze or money.  The fool is more annoying than amusing.  The rushed, climactic scene in which Orsino, having pined for Olivia for five acts, turns his love abruptly to Viola (whom he has never seen outside her male disguise) speaks to how urgently Shakespeare must have wanted to put the finish on this awful mess and bring down the curtain.  For a taste of Shakespeare's comedic power, read -- well, read any other comedy he wrote 
 I purchase this press, and was totally disappointed with this product. It takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press, than with an iron. I will be returning 
 The title of this book is misleading. After reading it , I realized what it actually means. A dummy wouldn`t know that the diet descibed in this book is a low-fat, low-cal diet. If you really want to know about the low carb diet, get 'Dr. Adkins`New Diet Revolution' or even 'The South Beach Diet'.I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy my new beverage of choice. Made from 100% organic soy, taste just like coffee and no caffeine. Finally, I got rid of that wired up feeling all day and feeling great. Look for it on the net by googling "s o yfee" 
 AS A CINEMA/TV MAJOR I MAY BE LITTLE ROUGH SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME  BUT I AM 70'S - 80'S ADDICT-O-HOLIC   I MEAN I WATCH THESE SHOWS DAILY!!!!  AS FAR AS SEASON 3 IS CONCERNED THERE ARE ONLY TWO EPISODES THAT ARE FUNNY {TRUST ME)!   1. THE THOMAS TREASURE  2. THE BENEFIT  (THE FINAL EPISODE)  WITH THAT SAID  I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IDIOT CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF WRITING OFF MABEL KING'S (MAMA) CHARACTER.  BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR THIS SHOW  BUT WHAT AMAZES ME IS THE FACT THAT THEY STILL WOULD TALK ABOUT HER IN THE LINES  LIKE SHE STILL WAS AROUND OR ON THE PAYROLL. IT WAS  REALLY AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE AS VIEWERS AND TO THIS TONY- NOMINATED* VETERAN ACTRESS ("THE WIZ" 1975*)  I WOULD HAVE RATHER THEM SAY SHE GOT RE-MARRIED TO BILL AND MOVED DOWN SOUTH AND BRING HER BACK FROM TIME TO TIME....  OR I HATE TO SAY IT BUT .....AT LEAST KILL HER CHARACTER OFF PROPERLY (IF THERE IS SUCH A THING) MAYBE A CAR ACCIDENT OR A ILLNESS.  THAT WAY THE VIEWERS AS WELL AS HER TV CHILDREN ROGER AND DEE CAN HAVE CLOSURE   AND DEE'S ACTING ABILITY(OR LACK OF IT) WAS WAS VERY VISIBLE WITHOUT THOSE CUTE ONE-LINERS SHE WAS KNOWN FOR IN SEASON 1-2   THERE WERE TWO THINGS MAJOR THINGS THAT SEALED THE DEAL FOR CANCELATION   1. SEASON 3= THE WRITING AND STORY LINES WERE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  2. BIG AND LITTLE EARL (ENOUGH SAID) WELL.... TO ME THEY SEEMED LIKE A BAD CORN FLAKE COMMERCIAL.  THEY ONLY REASON I BOUGHT SEASON THREE WAS BECAUSE I WAS A FAN OF SEASON 1-2 AND WANTED IT FOR MY COLLECTION.  WITH THAT SAID  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book is so old it should not be sold anymore.  The so called "updates" are simply token and the whole book is too old to be of help. Also, the people are so spartan they really don,t relate to the modern cruiser..ie.. they spend time on the merits of kerosene lights.  When they finally retire to land I sure they will end up in a trailer park 
 This book should have been 2-3 chapters long.  The content didn't move me to make life changes like some other things I've read.  I wouldn't recommend it 
 This is a terrible excuse for a guidebook.  Its maps are blatantly incorrect: the subway map is a ballpark approximation, at best, and things in Central Park are not located where the map says they are, among others.  Its attraction descriptions neglect crucial information about the details you actually need at the sites (the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty in particular), and the restaurant descriptions do not show the complete picture.  I don't throw out books I dislike, but this one is going straight to the recycling bin 
 The prologue of this book is exquisite. The fallability of humans is delicately expressed though the use of origami-doctors and priests who build people. Unfortunately, the inventiveness of Plascencia grows beyond endearing as the chapters move on. It becomes unbearable. The story is lost in script-like repetition and hastily placed ink splotches. While Plascencia may have had good reason behind his innovation, creativity hits a reader like a bat to the head and leaves them with no time to contemplate who threw the bat or why the bad was thrown before they pass out and puke over their new shoes. 
 To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering.  
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 This microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the Sony HDR-HC7 video camera on most websites, including SonyStyle.  While the microphone may be of good quality (I didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the HDR-HC7.  The microphone does plug into the MIC jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (Note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  After nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a Sony Technician, I learned that there is a "jury-rigged" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  Otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  The Sony technician finally admitted that it was " curious" that Sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  If you have a Sony HDR-HC7, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MICROPHONE! 
 This is the politically correct books on Duke. If you are however honestly and objectively interested in Duke, read instead his My Awakening 
 This DVD was a total disappointment.  First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value.  Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits.  To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods.  This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head!  I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition.  I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits. 
 Warning! I resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot. It destroyed my system and I had to format my whole drive.  Read all the reviews from this program carefully. I read them but did not believe them 
 This book had some interesting half-baked ideas about society, but it felt like a bunch of stories thrown together, straining for connection.  I didn't really like or relate to anyone in the book, and felt vaguely depressed upon finishing it.   I wish I had stopped reading in the middle.. 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 MY MOM FIGURED OUT FINDHORN A LONG TIME AGO - GOT SOME INFO FROM THE DEPT OF AGRICULTURE IN SCOTLAND AND FOUND THAT THE GROUND FINDHORN SITS ON IS PERFECT FOR GROWING ANYTHING.  IN MY OPINION, THE WHOLE OPERATION IS A FAKE 
 the nose trimmer works well, but the electric razor not well at all. Does not cut at all. I would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor. the cost was a little high for the product 
 Good, as the 'break this rule' bits are well taken, but most writers will eventually come to these conclusions once you really start struggling with paying the bills. 85% of the book is anecdotes you can easily skim or forget about as filler. There are very few useful web sites suggested compared to much weightier works available, such as 'The Freelance Success Book', among others. The writers clearly spent little time working on this, but understood how easy it is to get wannabes excited enough to buy their book 
 As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it 
 "Soul" to these authors suggests nothing like acceptance, forbearance, sacrifice, or even love. Instead, our most profound goal is the square footage of our homes -- a statistic cited in more than one  anecdote among the ultimate measures of success. Luckily, the absurd  reasoning (one is led to conclude that loved ones who died of cancer were  insufficiently optimistic) combined with maudlin sentimentality began to  tickle my funny bone. By the time I got to the crippled ghetto youth  announcing his intention to become a football star ("Orenthal James,  but my friends just call me O.J.) tears of laughter were streaming down my  face 
 The review by Publishers Weekly is incorrect. The review says: "...each photo is printed full-page recto, with the facing verso page containing only the plate number, etc." With that statement I expected each of the photographs to be placed on a single page and not be printed through the binding. It turns out 51 of the 100 photographs are printed through the binding. The presence of the binding in the photograph destroys the continuity of the image making the photograph meaningless to me. If each photograph had been printed in smaller dimensions so as to fit on a single page it would have had far more impact. For example, image 093 has the folded paper and thread of the binding in the center of the mushroom cloud. That isn't authentic. That isn't accurate reproduction. Image 096 IS printed on a single page and is quite impressive. And the paper these images are printed on is guaranteed to preserve your smudged fingerprints. It should have been printed on either matt paper or high density glossy paper for greater impact and longer life. I am sorry to have purchased this book and I'll never buy another book by Michael Light. If you can find an original copy of the 1988 book entitled "U.S. Nuclear Weapons - The Secret History" by Chuck Hansen you'll find some really impressive photographs. They might be smaller than "100 Suns" but they have greater impact 
 Apparently you need to "know" your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site 
 Big Black Captain Beefheart the Talking Heads Brian Eno King Crimson Ennio Morricone Slint Pere Ubu  See that list?  That list, as short as it is, is a list of bands that had an impact, no matter how small, it was a lasting one, on rock music.  These performers streched the boundaries and created new genres or at the very least took stale genres and shook them up, creating flawless works of art.  Arctic Monkeys, and their bretheren of pseudo-talking heads/80's brit rock/dance rock trash are the complete and total opposite.  This is some of the most lifeless, shallow, vapid, uninspiring and unoriginal trash since KC and the Sunshine band.  But, brits being brits, they just have to have one band to shove down the rest of the world's throat, *ahem* Oasis, then, a year later they completely disown them, because, well, everyone has jumped on the train, so why stay on when it's overcrowded with buffoons?  But that's just the point, this music, from the second it was conceived was about as meaningful as a Cheech and Chong movie, this isn't music, this is audio-candy, absolutely no value what so ever.  I mean, I knew going in to this, I got it from my library, I wasn't about to pay money to cement the fact that these guys are total garbage, that it was going to be a miserable experience, and the opening track began to steer me in a more optimistic direction, but by the time "I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor" came on, I was seconds away from tossing the disc out my car window.  When all is said and done, Arctic Monkeys are going to be right up there with the Kaiser Chefs and The Bravery as bands that all the little empty headed sheep just gobbled up and forgot about 2 months later 
 I was anticipating this book for a while.  I am a big fan of the DCU and of Green Lantern who is one of my favorite DC superheroes.  I read Green Lantern including the transition to Kyle Rayner as Green Lantern.  With that said, I am very disappointed in this novel and the concepts that it introduced.  Mr. O'Neil is a better writer than this and I am disappointed in him as well.  I was so moved (negatively) by this book that I felt I should write a review.  Like I said, I know the story about Hal Jordan and Coast City and Parallax and the eventual handing of the Power Ring to Kyle Rayner.  I have no problem when a writer massages an origin or two to make the story work.  But this felt like he took what I knew of the Justice League and it's core and Green Lantern and the Oans and put them all into a food processor.  What we got out of it looked like chunky green pea sludge.  I won't pass all the details of the story along but I felt like the author took established events in the DCU and made them into bland, trivial entries to justify the telling of his story.  The origin of the Justice League, the characterization of it's members, the use of Hal Jordan and "Di", the misrepresentation of the Oans and the Green Lantern Corps were a big pile of steaming ____.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the author was thinking.  Gross misrepresentation simply doesn't fit into story.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, the Kyle Rayner we see here is a whiner.  If I heard the story he told in this novel, I'd strip him of the ring and give it to someone else.  The idea that only humans have artistic concepts which is why Kyle can do so well ... crap.  And Gandy?  Please.  Ganthet was a pretty key Oan in the scheme of things with the Guardians.  The author reduced him to a cardboard cutout with Ganthet's likeness.  I just find the novel contrived and ill-thought.  If I was the author's editor and knew a quarter of what I know about the Green Lantern and his history, I would have told Mr. O'Neil to go back to the drawing board.  There were a few concepts that I had to agree with.  Some of what Kyle had to do to train.  Yes, good ideas.  The idea that the Oans have lost touch with other sentient beings.  Again, I have to agree with that.  And the portrayal of Batman, was right on.  But Kyle sleepwalking (not literally) through a third of the novel and the misrepresentation of Hal Jordan and the Oans left me ill by the end.  If this was an assignment that was turned in for a grade, I'd give it an 'F' just in the poor manner that the story was told.  Even worse knowing the history of the characters that star in it.  Mr. O'Neil, I'm disappointed in you.  You should never have turned in this story 
 Thank God I DID NOT BUY this book. I took 30 minutes to read this book at a bookstore and if you are interested in learning how to hack, then this book is not for you. This book DOES NOT SHOW YOU HOW TO HACK, it's just  another ordinary book which shows you how to PREVENT a hacker from attacking your computer/network. Very disappointing. Even the information in this book that shows you how to prevent a hacker attack can be found online easily. This book is definatly not worth it 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
  In short, How can anybody be this good at shooting with one hand on himself and the other on the trigger? More on the Marines and less of the I,I,I,Me,Me,M 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 I bought the book,but am sorry I bought it.Maybe I'm overeducated for this book,having taken courses in Geography,Geology and History.I read little that was new to me.For someone less knowledgeable,it could be interesting.The format is easy to use and the descriptions are easy to follow.But I was not inspired and as I indicated  am sorry 
 I really wanted to like this book. The premise seemed interesting and the art had a certain style that appealed to me. With that in mind... It just felt like the only reason that the main character, Matty Roth, was a photographer was so he could be dragged all over Manhattan to show readers what has become of famous NYC landmarks. The main character seemed so two dimensional, I was actually wishing he would die becausse he is a civilian meant to be nothing more than the readers eyes. Readers are givin next to no background on either Matty, or why there's a DMZ in New York City. Having events occur virtually without context, I didn't care what happened next in the story at all. Even though this book is supposed to show New Yorkers' strength of how they try to continue their lives fairly normally, it just ends up feeling like they had no problems accomplishing any of it, like a pre established garden of Eden in the middle of a war zone. Mostly I tried to enjoy the art. It'll probably sit on my shelf, never to be touched again, so no one else will have to read it either 
 It took me Dungeon Master's Guide II to find out that I had bought too many D&D books already. I am used to flipping through a D&D book and sorting things that I like and might be useful from things that are a waste of space. I didn't find anything useful in this book. If you're an experienced DM, you won't either. Here's why:  Chapter 1 - Running a game provides you with tips on how to deal with different kinds of players, and different tastes for games. The approach is almost therapeutic, and deals with communication issues on the game table. Chapter 2 - Adventures has more new traps, some tips on using published material, and rules for aerial battles, crowds, mobs... to save you from the effort of coming up with them yourself. Chapter 3 - The Campaing Has tips about preparing a campaign. That's where my biggest disappointment is - at the session on how to create towns, it has very few numerical statistics. It basically lists what kind of professionals and shops you'll find in a fantasy-medieval city. Chapter 4 - Saltmarsh describes the city of Saltmarsh. Pretty generic. Chapter 5 - Non Player Characters have a lot of ready-made multiclass NPCs (as if they were hard to create) and a list of powers to make NPCs unique (but unfortunately they have no rules to use them in PCs). Chapter 6 - Characters has rules on apprenticeship and masters (that is actually nice), and general guidelines (nothing numerical) on designing custom Prestige Classes. Chapter 7 - Magic Items has actually no new magic items! Just a new approach to old ones.  Novice DMs may find it actually quite useful and inspiring. So may lazy DMs. If you're used to running campaigns and using your own material in your game, you'll find this book nothing more than a collection of nice illustrations and things you already know 
 This guy is a snake oil salesman. Watch out people.  Open your minds 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 I read this book and hated it; I was sorry I wasted my money.... Normally, I would have donated the book ater reading it. But, in this case I was so disappointed, I threw the book away after reading it.  I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US.  I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee.  It seemed to me they found a "story" they liked, and that is where their critical thinking ended. It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought.   After reading it, it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa.  I am from western PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks local color.  She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale.  Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families, EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say "ain't," "slippy," and "youns." This would be esp. true for someone like the main character, Harley. (There are people with college degrees from this area who still have "color" in their language.) O'dell is no Faulkner or Caufield. I find this lack of "local flavor" with a lot of modern authors.  Unfortunately, our books are even becoming Mcdonaldized. There is nothing special about this book 
 Well, it's a tribute to capitalism I suppose that here we have the 8th, and not final, CD in a series that only about 3% of those who hear it don't hate.  So, who exactly is the market for this stuff?  Is is all just parents who think they are buying one thing and end up getting something else?  With each new CD there is a new crop of moms with three-year-olds just discovering music, and somehow these moms get suckered into buying this?  Why do the used copies of this cost more than a buck?  Anyway, my wife borrowed this at the library and I woke up this morning to this cra...uh...stuff playing on my three-year-old's CD player (usually reserved for Beach Boys and Barney tunes).  It sounded different from what he usually listens to so I listened to a few songs while I was waking up over my morning coffee.  Talk about creepy!  All these angst driven songs about stuff my little guy has no concept of and hopefully some stuff he never will.  What parent would buy this CD for a child knowing what's on it?   Anyway, I reserve my right as a parent to let my child have a childhood.  He can wait until his teenage years to be a rebel and listen to music I hate, and even then I'll draw a line somewhere.  I just didn't want to deal with this stuff during the present decade.   
 It's over thirty years since I read GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. I don't suppose I'll ever read them again. By the time she wrote them, Sayers had lost whatever she had to offer as a mystery writer. She was taking herself seriously. In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky. Avoid like the plague unless you wish to gross out on snobbery and sentimentality. And the murder method in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON is singularly unconvincing 
 if there was one point in my life where i feel i've wasted the most time, it was when i listened to this worthless garbage. If you knew what was good for you, you'd trash it if you've got it! Don't buy this! I found one on the ground and it was STILL a rip off! I wouldn't want anyone to hurl like I did after listening to Christina Aguilera's "Dirrrty" which is exactly what it is, and it belongs where all dirrrty things go... in the dump. About the only thing this cd is good for, is using as a frisbee, coaster, or trading in for a pathetic AOL dis 
 The only way that this book could be entertaining at all is if you go into it expecting nothing.  I was very disappointed in the writing.  The style is cheesy and the storyline is shallow and lame.  I had thought that this book was going to be a fun 'chick' book but the only 'chick' that would enjoy it lives in a barn 
 I have not been a able to find a good book on covered calls yet.  I understand most of the process but too many of these authors simplify the process.  There is too much "slippage" in the process and you have to watch your timing on using covered calls.  This is not a strategy that everyone can easily use and be successful 
 This book is not a very good book to learn from. I train with World-class fighters including UFC fighters and K-1 fighters. Many of the fight stances and Boxing forms are incorrect and telegraph your moves. The pictures are terrible and could easily mislead many beginner fighters. I recommend you to not purchase this book and instead spend your $10 on a class with a good instructor. You will learn more from a hour of that than this book 
 This was an incredibly frustrating transaction with Amazon - my worst ever.  This item was actually a "textbook outline," which was conveniently not mentioned in its description.  I would not have rated this purchase at "one star" but the review required that i give it at least one.  Horrible 
 Jim Knipfel is an idiot, truly. He's the type of person that delivers stories on characters like Werner Herzog and Ed Gein, very self-aggrandising, and, most significant to his idiot status, fails to understand anything at all. Want to be like Jim Knipfel? Quickly read a story in the newspaper, spend the next ten years watching The Nanny, then write a story based on what you read in the newspaper, and then assume the role of expert on the whole thing 
 I never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty. I had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did. II sure hope when I need to use it I will be able to. 
 It's been nine years since So So Def CEO (and now Virgin Records' President of Black Music) Jermaine Dupri released the label's gold-certified compilation So So Def Bass All Stars, Vol. 1. Since then he has steered the careers of rappers Da Brat and Bow Wow as well as releasing three other compilations showcasing the diversity and talent among the South. In the past, all of Dupri's compilations have been launching pads for regional artists as well as critically-acclaimed albums. Not so with his latest effort, Young, Fly & Flashy Vol.1 (So So Def/Virgin). A poor attempt at showcasing the newest So So Def signees, the album falls short of providing a taste of how innovative and dope Southern Hip-Hop can be. Instead we are given a project full of lackluster tracks, recycled concepts and artists whose passion is just not enough to set them a part from the popular players of today's burgeoning Southern rap scene.   Newcomers Young Capone and The Kid Slim fail to impress on tracks like "I'm Hot" and the tedious "10 Toes". With talented artists like Boyz N Da Hood and Slim Thug repping heavily for the South, competition is too fierce for Dupri's newest draft picks to deliver with no originality. Party joints like "Gotta Getcha", which is too short to be enjoyed, and KP and Envyi's "Put Cha Hands Up" are both mediocre attempts at club-friendly radio songs. "Put Cha Hands Up" just does not get the party started the same way the duo's 1997 hit "Shorty Swing My Way" did. And what could have been a hot ode to exotic dancers if it was just a little longer ("Gotta Getcha"), clocks in at less than three minutes.   But Southern enthusiasts don't fret; all is not lost on this LP and there are a few tracks worth checking for. "Kodak Moment" is authentic down-South rider music featuring Kavious, Pastor Troy and UGK's Bun B. The addictive "I Think They Like Me" (Remix) is made for stuntin' in your ride and worth a listen just to hear Da Brat's scene-stealing bars. ATL veteran Pastor Troy shines again on "Just to Fight", which is reminiscent of his classics "No More Play in GA" and "I Declare War." Another heater, "Throw'd Off" featuring T. Waters is a catchy party joint guaranteed to have heads nodding in the club although the Asian-influenced track sounds similar to the Terror Squad's 2004 hit "Lean Back".   Staying true to today's formulaic topics (bling, pimping and the streets) combined with a lack of originality, Young, Fly and Flashy Vol. 1 could not have been more appropriately-titled. The album does little to give a true glimpse of the potential these newcomers possess, nor does it highlight the musical creativity and hit-making ability Jermaine Dupri is known and celebrated for. 
 I deffintly agree with each reviewer that wrote in saying this book is terible. I was skeptical when I saw the little half moon on the spine which hallmarks Llewyllyn publication. I picked the book up at Barnes and Noble and sat down to read. I spent a good hour and a half looking through the book, reading parts and laughing. This book is almost total nonsense. The author either has no idea what he is talking about or he has decided to dupe people into buying nonsense. Ya wanna learn about hoodoo then read mules and men 
 I've read most of Chuck Palahniuk's earlier work and have always enjoyed his stories. His characters are intriguing, his prose is uniquely readable, and his insights into modern American culture are simple but effective. This book, however, was a real disappointment. I put it down halfway through because I couldn't take it anymore - and I almost never stop reading a book before I've finished it.   As other reviewers have noted, the short stories that make up half the book are actually pretty good reads in and of themselves. Grotesque, perhaps, but nothing so bad as to overwhelm the author's intent of delving into the various characters' psychology. The overacrching story that ties them together is a different matter. It starts off interestingly enough, but it quickly turns into self-parody and descends from there, becoming repetitive and ultimately unreadable.   Without the short stories interspersed, this book wouldn't be worth a second glance. If you're interested in reading Palahniuk for the first time, you'd be better served by Survivor, Fight Club, or Lullaby. If you're already a fan, pass on this and wait for the next...or go re-read your old favorites 
 Replaced an old Sharp fax machine with what I thought was newer and better machine. WRONG!! if you don't baby it , it will not feed multiple pages. likes to pull two or three sheets at a time. What a pain! Other functions are not as intuitive as one would expect 
 What's worse than a bad cd?  "The Burdens of Being Upright."  I don't even know where to start.  I bought it because I really liked the first song "Mother Mother" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album.  The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money.  Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks.  Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them.  And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't 
 The book was already sold after I bought it.  Please take it off web site after it's sold. But I was reimbursed properly 
 What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say.  Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals!  Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good.  And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary.  
 Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the swing seat I bought for my 3 year old son. Since it only has one string (it is actually more like a string than a rope) holding the seat, it is really unstable and my son has a hard time swinging. I have to push him since he is not that advanced yet to doing it on his own and therefore the whole thing always goes crooked or he leans too much backwards or forwards which is not his fault, it is just really hard to balancethe swing seat on one string. Therefore, I don't think that I would buy that swing seat again. Next time I will buy one that has for sure two ropes holding on to it.  
 I purchased two of these cases for my daughters, ages 5 and 7, but we were all disappointed with them.  It supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories, but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in.  They also come apart everytime the girls open them, and they are hard for the girls to put back together.  They are good for keeping all the little Barbie accessories out of the way.  I just wish they were better quality.  A friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter (with a zipper), and she says it is great, but I have not been able to find that item anywhere 
 This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized XBox controller, these cables are worthless 
 Forget about this edition of the book--which I would love to find another original 1963 edition of to replace the one I gave away. The cheeseballs at Harvest who choose to reprint this title by shooting pocket edition-sized pages of toothy paper and then enlarging it to trade paperback size should be horsewhipped. Fat broken type throughout. Nearly unreadable. Coyote, buck ugly printing. I understand the margins in publishing, but a good selling backlist title like this should elicit some respect from the publisher, even if they have none for their readers. Somebody should be canned for this want of taste and judgement. We're talking about Florence here. The point of the book is aesthetics. Get the book from the library and wait for a new edition from another publisher. Are all Harvest books this poor? Venice Observed is also a travesty 
 Or at least not what I was looking for...but based on all the other reviews here, I thought it was.  This book has a very limited audience in mind, namely those who are giving "speeches", not just regular, everyday presentations and meetings.  The name of the book is deceiving, and so are the reviews.  The first chapter is the only one that is moderately worthwhile if you're actually looking for tips on becoming more confident.  Otherwise, it is simply a laundry list of ways to give big speeches; not helpful at all to the average joe who works in corporate america and just wants to feel more confident.  I realize this is difficult to teach in a book, but the other reviewers gave the impression that I might garner some tidbits on this.  
 The entire enterprise of theology -- attempting to explain a God whom even religion notes is beyond understanding -- is by definition ridiculous and nonsense!  What to say here?  Simply this.  The argument of Barth and Hauerwas against natural theology is simply a way of making irrational religion impervious to rational critique.  If you start by saying that Christianity is not based on nature, then what is it based on?  Barth/Hauerwas would say revelation.  But revelation is simply the delusion of old Jews and Greeks, who had no more notion of what God was or might be than the man in the moon.  Thus revelation is baloney and so is Hauerwas and even Barth, for all Barth's intellectual distinction.  It is time to call a spade a spade:  theology is nonsense.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months.  at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject.  rereading it now Im not so sure.  Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them.  What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy.  His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas.  Its plain dumb, like many other "anglo-american" readings of "continental" philosophy.  spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.    To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint.  
 I read this book before I ever read his column which I found to be extremely stupid in its quippy sarcastic humor. Basically he makes it sound like he and his boyfriend didnt want to do the stereotypical gay couple things so then decided to adopt.  His perception of the process to becoming a parent really sounds like they were getting  a new accesory.  In his favor, I've seen Savage on Bill Maher and enjoyed him, I just cant stand his column or this stupid book.   
 Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans.  I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it.  I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs?  Attrocious!  These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll.  The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots.  The production is over the top and bombastic.  Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made.  
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like "Toy Story." The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and "delicate" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 I got the baby alive Hispanic doll for my daughter for Christmas. I opted for the Hispanic doll becuase I thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak French primarily in our home.I must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description. She does not speak English at all...you can press her bracelet a million times and no English. And when she does speak, her English is slurred and unintelligible. We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!! The reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing 
 I want a complete and diverse needlecraft library and I was pleased to see this book listed.  But the reviews and book descriptions led me to believe it would be innovative and new.  It's not.  The layout of the book, the photos and the illustrations are excellent.  The patterns are mundane. I don't use novelty yarns, at all - so I knew I would be adapting the patterns using merinos, silks and wool blends.  The problem with that plan is the book is all about the novelty yarns.  Once you take away the novelty there is nothing left but basic plain crocheted vests, ponchos, shells and a few accessories.  I like easy, I like fast, but I also like style.  I was looking for a new take on the square, a way to put crocheted squares together in a new and exciting way.  I did not find it with this book.  I will gift this book to someone who appreciates novelty yarns in all their glory - because it is a beautiful book and deserves a good home where it will be used and appreciated 
 This looks so hilarious!  How did you lose Jessica Simpson you dolt?!  What a loser, now he'll be relegated to the back of page six and then gone forever, way to use 'em and lose 'em Simpson.  
 All that one can say about this book is that it's "Gothic". Yeah, right. Here are ghosts, witches, mad wives in the attic, black cats and other mandatory attributes. But probably, "gothic" decorations are not enough for a book, there should be something else. Something that I failed to find. The novel is tedious and empty. A weak attempt to create a thriller rather failed, the plot is hardly glued together, the episodes that are probably supposed to scare remind a bad horror movie that is full of dark rooms, ominous music and crazy screams, but simply does not frighten, period.  I finished the book, but it was a waste of time. If you want a good thriller by Joanne Harris, read her "Gentlemen and players" instead 
 I was not a huge fan of the first book, but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book. This may not be the case here. While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be "on to him" every book? This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages. 
 I reviewed this book for some colleagues.  This is what I have to offer:  If you like throwing money out, buy this book.  If you are curious, pick it up at a library before you decide to indulge. This is a miserable self-proclaimed self-help guru who needs serious therapy 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 You have to put the handle of the sweeper together as part of assembling the sweeper.  However, there is nothing to hold the pieces of the handle together... so it falls apart frequently!  I read a review about the defective handle before I bought the product.  I thought that it might be a "one time" thing with the reviewer that mentioned it.  Well, low and behold, it happened to me as well.  Its difficult to use when the handle falls apart all the time.  And I even tried to duct tape it!  It didn't help.  
 I guess I'm astonished that anyone would give this book more than one star. While Mr. Moyers clearly makes the profound point that, "half measures avail naught" when trying to achieve sobriety, his current attitudes would seem to convey continuing beliefs that contradict this point.   His "dark humor" did not conceal lingering bitterness, starting with the very quote chosen for the jacket regarding his dad's alleged statement that he hated William C. There is a sad and frustrating mixture of growing insights, stated wryly, followed with what could only be read as continued self pity, resentment, blame and excuses.  The point that Mr. Moyers makes- addictions are a disease and are beyond the scope of reason or direct control once they reach a particular stage is convincingly expressed. The short commercial near the end, to increase public awareness, seems like an afterthought, and indeed, serves to soften the tone of the book.  Even as substance abuse counselor and avid participant of the 12 Step Program of Recovery, I could not help but be bored by the author himself. He seems, still, a tiresome, brooding man, utterly obsessed with his father, still stuck and highly reactive, as evidenced by the constant references to his father's mishandling of events.  He wonders what would have happened if his parents had sought treatment more aggressively for him early on? He speculates about their role in his melanoma-identifying himself as a cancer victim? He manages to be both facetious about his unrealistic expectations regarding his father's performance, alternating with harsh judgments and criticisms that sound ridiculous at best.  His supportive spouse winds up severely depressed, recently, and eating disordered?  Small wonder.  I don't know when I have been more disappointed with, even embarrassed by, what could have been an important memoir. To have had parents and family such as Mr. Moyers has, to have little to complain about beyond being asked to participate in Scouting, is an affront and assault upon the splendid Mr. and Mrs. Bill Moyers.  It is obvious that in picking apart almost all of his dad's lovely letters, William Cope Moyer's attempt to individuate is still in its infancy.  One cannot be acquainted with the character and work of the senior Moyers without feeling the heartbreak that Bill must have felt at reading his son's remarks. Joy at William's enduring recovery may overshadow this sad book, which I believe would have been much better left unpublished, unread. Having an unusual name is hardly a point to be repeatedly made in this highly repetitious and bitter book. If addictions are indeed a disease, they hardly need justification, much less this explaination.     
 If you like beautifully shot, well acted films with plot lines and twists that have more holes that one of those huge wheels of swiss cheese you find at the cheese maker, this film is for you.  The most impressive slight of hand here is that viewers thought this was a great story.  I don't get it.  The story fails so miserably I can't understand how this "thing" got made.  Speaking of cheese, watch closely (as the opening narrative instructs us).  Indeed.  This film does not stand up to even the lightest level of scrutiny.  I can't tell you why without spoiling the film but here goes, you've been warned.  The entire premise of the "scientific" trick (or Tesla's REAL magic trick) at the end of the movie makes absolutely no sense at all if you are the guy doing the trick you are going to die.  If you think about all those hats out in the woods and the cat, then who ever uses the device replicates himself (the person standing inside the device) and shows up in another place not to far from the device.  If you are standing in the device you are going to die as soon as that trap door opens.  Watch it and think about it for a few minutes.  It does not make any sense without killing the original magician.    Also, there are far too many contrived scenes where the magicians are sabotaging one another after being picked to assist in a trick from among the crowd.  One will put on a disguise, go to the other's show, get picked to assist and then sabotage the trick.  How could they keep picking each other, even with the disguise, out of a crowd of volunteers in the audience?  Ridiculous.    And that brings us to the identical twin that made the original transported man trick possible...  Are we to believe that the wife and the daughter could not tell these two apart?  Have you ever dated an identical twin?  I have and I could quickly tell one from one another.  So that aspect of the story is completely dumb.  Also, are you telling me that the guy's wife would not even know he had an identical twin?  Did a high schooler write this story?  If the plot and twists are hard to follow (as one reviewer writes) it's because they don't make a darn bit of sense if you take a moment to consider what you've just seen.    Again, well acted, beautiful imagery and costumes, it's well directed, and the story COULD have been good except the screen play writers didn't really think through the scenarios.   This is a great movie picture wise, set-wise, and acting, IF you don't want to spend any time thinking about it 
 This is an interesting book, no doubt about it. But the authors make mistakes common to Southern apologists.   The first is that the Civil War was not fought over slavery. Certainly the Civil War was not fought over the morality of slavery, with the North fighting for right and the South fighting to defend evil. But yes, the Civil War absolutely was fought over the Economics of Slavery. All wars are economic.  Here is a part of Georgia's Declaration of Secession:       For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic. This hostile policy of our confederates has been pursued with every circumstance of aggravation which could arouse the passions and excite the hatred of our people, and has placed the two sections of the Union for many years past in the condition of virtual civil war.  This is from South Carolina's declaration of secession:  The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.  This from Texas':  Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.        As for whether the majority of soldiers fighting were fighting for or against slavery, the question is frankly, ridiculous. Ask any veteran of Vietnam or Korea what they fought for. They fought because their country told them to fight. Not because they'd done a personal analysis of the communist threat. But for the COUNTRY, yes communism certainly was at the heart of those wars. 
 Like the other reviewer below stated, this DVD release from Koch has been cut to shreds. It is not the director's cut and it only runs 71 minutes. Stay away from this one 
 I was excited to start reading this book when I saw it in the bookstore; however, my excitement quickly turned to boredom as I struggled to finish this tale. One of the comments on the cover of the paperback claimed it was Amazing Race meets Raiders of the Lost Ark or something like that. It was neither. I was hoping for a fast paced, traveling adventure all over the globe, as the descriptions lead me to believe - but it wasn't. I was hoping for exciting tomb adventures with traps and puzzles and such.  Once we take away all the excitement and adventures what do we have left? "The Codex." This story is a tale of stereotypical brothers who are not even well crafted characters for their stereotyped personalities. I guess it can be hard to create original characters from completely unoriginal molds. A failed love story, unbelievable character interactions, and the longest (and most uneventful) jungle adventure ever! I cannot count how many times the characters were turning back and heading for home, or talking endlessly about a panther attack that was going to happen in a few chapters, or the relative lack of adventure throughout this harrowing land of Hondurus. Besides a couple of lame actions sequences randomly thrown in, this book had nothing on the "Raiders of the lost Ark." Didn't even come close.  With a somewhat interesting premise this book had a lot of potential. However, to me it was dissappointing in all aspects because the story was forced along at a insanely slow pace. I could see a book like this being 300 pages or 350, but 400?! I love longer books, but only if they need to be long. I can't even remember what made this book so long, it must have been the endless mumbling about the travel in the swamps and the jungle.  My advice? Skip this one 
 Charles Adams is a man possessed: possessed of hatred for Abraham Lincoln, the North, and the United States of the 21st century.  That the book is not history is proven by its subtitle:  Arguing the Case for Southern Secession.  An historian would not argue a case for or against any historical event.  Like his counterpart Thomas DiLorenzo, Adams is an unhappy man who feels driven to trash the entire American historical scene with incomplete, anachronistic arguments.  Neither man delves deeply enough into history, although Adams is the better of the two in that regard.  Suffice it to say that if you truly want history, Adams and DiLorenzo are not the men to deliver it 
 This is an atrocious book.  The author's "professional job search" is an excuse to trash career counselors, fat people, and Christians--people that, judging from the prejudicial attitudes expressed in this book--Barbara despises, with a capital D.  Despite her lazy job search and a faked resume--I question her ethics--Ms. Holier-Than-Thou found two jobs.  Wasn't that the whole point? As one reader below notes, she turned them down because they weren't good enough for her. She clearly has her private demons, and "professional level work" may be one of them.    Barbara's book makes me think that she must be extremely insecure.  She doesn't want anyone to think she is less than competent.  Maybe that's why she rejects help, lashes out, criticizes others, and refuses two job offers.  Insecurity.    I wanted her to take one of the two jobs she was offered, or find something good enough for her.  But she chose to do neither.  This is a book about how hard it was for poor old (sniff!) Barbara to find a job.  Brace yourself for boredom and anger.  Maybe she would have been better off in a self-help group. Spare us, Barbara!    
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one 
 This one is a total dud. Come on one David Lynch is enough. I'm assuming the director's pitch went something like this: It's Mullholland Drive at a carnival! That's assuming he saw Mullholland Drive or any films before he started directing.  
 I was raised Christian, but very recently have been actively pracicing Buddhism. Although I have rejected many of the belifs from Christian church, I am still trying to reconcile my Christian upbringing with Buddhism. I read Living Buddha, Living Christ a while ago and although the message was simplistic, I enjoyed the book. I was expecting further discussion of Christianity and Buddhism in Going Home, but was dissapointed that it was a disjointed series of dharma talks with the difficult to understand, circular language that many Buddhism books contain and little real content on Christianity and Buddhism 
 It's true, I threw this book away because I foolishly highlighted it right from the beginning, otherwise I would have just taken it back to the bookstore-- I also took some of the quizzes right off the bat and therefor couldn't even sell it on ebay. Alan Schoomaker spends a lot of time telling you if you had any natural talent for the game you wouldn't need to read this book and he's right. This book was absolutely useless for me.   Specifically I didn't have any need for his convoluted grid system, which is the heart of the book, to rate games and players. A grid system I find much inferior to common sense. It is fairly obvious, to me anyway, when I am playing a Calling Station, a Rock, or a Maniac, and to make the necessary adjustments. It is also equally obvious that these playing styles have deeper psychological significance for the players, themselves--  I mean why else would somebody continue to employ a known losing strategy at the poker table-- so his insights into their personalities was just a waste of my time.    I could understand that if you are still a losing player after many year of playing, a habitual Calling Station, Rock or Manic yourself and find it hard to play a basic tight aggressive game, or somebody, like Schoonmaker, himself, who just has no intuition, whatsoever, when it comes to people, than maybe this book will be more useful to you than it was for me. If so you might want to take a look at it...  I wish I would have been able to sell you my copy, though. 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 Sheer and utter.  This hardly can be called a work of fiction.  Had this been his first work, I could understand the grammatical mistakes, but this is inexcuseable.  The publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired 
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 nothing more really needs to be said.I'm running a 3GHz P4;256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs,lags and locks up on my computer. I tried uninstalling & reinstalling-same effect.DO NOT BUY THIS GAM 
 It's difficult to believe that John Patrick Shanley, shortly after winning an Oscar for "Moonstruck," penned this abominable movie.  What was he thinking?  "The January Man" tries to be a comedy, a mystery, a romance, and a thriller, but it fails miserably on all levels.  With an all-star cast including Kevin Kline, Alan Rickman, Rod Steiger, Susan Sarandon, and Harvey Keitel, you'd think this would be a gem.  Alas, it's just a big mess with an implausible storyline, awful dialogue, and no chemistry between the actors.  It's rare and appalling to see so much talent produce so poor of a movie 
 This book is the most extreme that I have ever read about. It advocates eating ONLY alkaline foods, citrus,avocados, bananas, almonds, etc. It eliminates your freedom to ever eat any quantity of acidic foods all red meat, pork, most fruits, and everthing processed. The flaw in this author's theory is the fact that the body is able to moderate its internal PH by excreting extra acid through the urine.Yes, I agree with him that over eating acidic foods all the time will cause your body to retain water and body fat and tax your eliminating organs. I also agree that following his diet plan of drinking greens, 5 liters of water a day and eating only vegatables and small amounts of fish will cause you to loose dramatic amounts of weight, but who can live like that for an extended amount of time? Read The acid-alkaline diet by Christopher Vasey, N.D. for a more realistic and balanced approach. Read Mastering the Zone by Barry Sears for a diet you can live with for the rest of your life. I went from 209 to 151 on the Zone diet and have never gained it back.Read the Superfoods Healthstyle for a truly  realistic healthy lifestlye. 
 I think I paid way too much for this extremely slim and small book.  This paperback book measures approximately 3 inches by 5 inches.  About 1/10 of an inch think.  I paid over $5 from Amazon.  The pages can easily be torn by a toddler or preschooler.  It's just way too small to read to several children at once.  Everyone is complaining that they can't see it 
 Moen's book recounts an intriguing series of personal journeys undertaken during classes at the Monroe Institute (TMI). The classes there build on experiences by its founder Robert Monroe detailed a series of books written over a span of many years. In a sense the Moen chronicle (this is vol 3) picks up where Monroe leaves off using the same kind of annoying jargon. Fortunately there is a glossary to guide the reader. Many other authors have tried to capture the goings-on at Monroe, but Moen seems to have turned it into a career. If you are a current or prospective TMI student, these writings could be the ultimate guide (or puff-piece) to bring a new level of understanding. However, if you are the average reader thinking from the title that you are going to learn something more about the afterlife as depicted by books in the spiritualist tradition, forget it. Science fiction fans would probably find great enjoyment with the work. Moen is an effective writer who maintains a fast-paced description of his experiences, but the jargon-laden pages are a bit much to attract attention from a general audience. His fun-filled episodes with their never-ending sexual overtones are more reminiscent of a teen-ager at Disneyland than a metaphysical explorer pushing to new levels of understanding. The volume is a testament to Moen's amazing astral abilities and his mentoring of TMI students. If you would like a description that is an order of magnitude more useful try the "Life in the world Unseen" series from Anthony Borgia or free afterlife ebooks at spiritwritings.co 
 I purchased this device for my Windows 2003 Home server in January 2007.  I did not notice that the box says supported systems were Win XP, 2000, Me, 98SE, NT4.0. Rarely do consumer level goods list Win Server 2000 or 2003 as options.  In all cases, drivers for these other OS can be found on the vendor's web site.  Not the case with Netgear.    I installed the card and proceeded to load the drivers (from CD).  The CD said it required XP, etc, so I went to the vendor's web site to obtain the most current ones.  The most recent driver for WINXP was from 2003!  I was not able to use the dreivers form the vendor's web site, but another comment here about Netgear using RealTEK chipsets sent me on the right path.  I was able to install the drivers for the RealTEK Gigabit adapter w/o issue.  I've sworn off D-Link due to multiple issues with rebates that they have refused to pay.  I'm now adding in Netgear to the list due to poor driver support. For me, it's Linksys only.  Why mess with others when you can have Cicso (owner of Linksys) in your corner.  
 I do not usually leave comments about purchases but this Johnson/Broida offering is so dismal it deserves a mention.  You will be much better off with Palm's online documentation/help files and forget about wasting your money on this turkey.  Truly a real disappointment.  No fault for Amazon....delivery was, as usual, very fas 
 I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart 
 This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted.  Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing.  Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient.  Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer.   Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones.   Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.   
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 I bought this because I was so glad to finally see a book about the God, but this book is a farce.  Wicca is a religion that says, "All gods are one god," etc. and we are supposed to be supportive of other people's religions.  So what right does Conway have to bash the Christian god and say that he is not real???  She says her book is about "the true god."  Isn't that what the Christians say, that theirs is the only true god?  How is what Conway says any different, and yet she bashes the Christians!  I am glad to see this book out of print and hope it stays that way.  Janet and Stewart Farrar's book The Witches' God is so much better 
 I gave a one star to this item only because I couldn't give a lower rating than that. The image quality is very very bad. We decided to return it in just the first half hour we started using it. It doesn't work properly with yahoo messenger and the image quality is very bad in skype 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 To give you an idea about how little merit should be placed in this author's work, consider this: of the four example problems used in the book, three of them are solved incorrectly!  Once again an education professor proves how useless a degree in education really is.  As a math teacher and math major, I advocate for the content experts over the so-called education experts.  The whole book can be summed up by the following observation: "Word problems in most math textbooks seem contrived."  So?  They're useful tools to gradually warm up to real-world math applications which may be more useful but are certainly less beautiful.  I was hoping for an honest critique of math education, what I got was a petulant diatribe on the nature of word problems.  Disappointing to the Nth degree 
 Rather sad book which draws on his erudition and his personal experience. The background is interesting, but when he describes his experience with his mother`s decline and death, for me he descends into unconvincing  sentimentality. I guess he should stick to the academic writing he is  undoubtedly skilled in, as those are the best parts of the book. Little  genuine experience of the relationship of the physical to the spiritual  desert comes through for me with any conviction. I`m glad he survived;but  it doesn`t share enough of his experience to enlighten me 
 ...intentional rip off?  There is no 50 minute work out DVD included. The pump included does not work (after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn't even put a dent on the deflated ball) and becomes very hot after a while. I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates (if ever). The "65cm" ball turns out to be only "55cm."  I don't know... seems like a rip off to me, but amazon is not at fault, since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item.  Quality-wise, the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better. The plastic isn't so sticky, and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one, too 
 I own a ceramic (smooth top) stove. No where it the advertisement did it indicate that the Aebleskiver pan could not be used on the ceramicsurface. Being unfamiliar with the pan I could not know in advance. i was very disappointed 
 I'm all for a 4 point Calvinistic view, but this book is terrible because the author is so bent on making everything "spiritual" and not literal or forcing his "the church has replaced Israel" scheme. I should've realized this when the back cover states that he teaches at a Presbyterian Seminary in Austin.  He doesn't deal with the text exegetically, there are barely any footnotes, and it seems that he has no knowledge of Hebrew. I'm surprised the series chose him to do this book, because he is by NO MEANS a scholar, and as I said, I don't even think he knows Hebrew! He also doesn't deal with other commentaries or other current literature/scholarship on Jeremiah!  What a let down!  Mr. Dearman comes to the text with blatant presuppositions, and his Reformed views blinds him from careful exegesis.  I simply don't understand how these "scholars" can be so confident that their hermeneutics and conclusions are right.  The author basically says in the introduction that NOTHING in Jeremiah should lead us to any conclusions about the nation of Israel, or a millennium, etc.  Some bold claims, considering the hearers of Jeremiah would have certainly thought about a literal Israel and a future kingdom.    Even if you side with a Reformed eschatology, the book is not one of the best in the NIVAC series simply because there is so little handling of the text or cultural background or theology, or the original meaning.  I'm returning it. It is VERY slim for the 2nd longest Old Testament book (2nd to Psalms).  And, considering he's supposed to be covering Jeremiah and Lamentations, it's amazing how this book is so short.  Save your money, this book is terrible. I'm surprised the editor of the series let this in... 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 After thoroughly analyzing this book for a college paper I can say that I am no less than disgusted with the content of this piece.  It does nothing more than to bash "whites" as all being racist, biggots, and horrible human beings.  All it talks of is the disadvantages of being "black" and the inability of a person of color to come up in this world.  I wish the author would have analyzed the situation rather than just focusing on putting down "whites" for the sake of making a point.  I find the novel utterly disgusting and written in a poor, distasteful manner 
           The major prediction   made by Glassman and Hassett in this book,written in 1999,was that"A sensible target date for Dow 36,000 is early 2005,but it could be reached much earlier"(1999,p.140).This fantastic science fiction forecast,like the similar 1999 fiction forecasts of Abby Joseph Cohen, Elias(1999)and Kadlec(1999),was mathematically and economically impossible since the single best predictor of future stock market values is the rate of growth in gdp(gross domestic product).To obtain a Dow of 36,000 by 2005 at the latest would have required continuous quarterly gdp growth rates of 7%-8% from 1999 through 2005.Starting in late 1999(Sept.,1999) through March,2000,the 3 wisemen,Warren Buffett,George Soros,and Peter Lynch,liquidated all of the stocks in their portfolios and exited the market.They transferred their cash to other assets.Unfortunately,far too many financial investors failed to follow them out of all of the stock markets and ended up losing about 8 trillion dollars.The best long treatment of stock market behavior is the 3 rd edition of C.P.Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes(1996).His major point was that you automatically have a bubble once you start hearing  claims that there is a new economy that represents a complete break with all past market fundamentals.This was precisely the claim made by Gilder,Laffer,Wanniski,Glassman and Hassett,Elias,Kadlec,etc. Paul Samuelson's 1996 prediction-"Sometime in the next five years you may kick yourself for not reading and re-reading Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes"-hit the nail on the head.The best short treatment is still chapter 12 of John Maynard Keynes's 1936 The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money 
 A ghastly book by the sadly misnamed Sarah Smiley. I have a weakness for domestic memoirs (Jean Kerr, Shirley Jackson, Erma Bombeck) and I am, myself, a military wife, so I was excited to find this book and fully expected to enjoy it.  I hated it. A lot. With the exception of books about serial killers, I don't believe I've ever read a book with a protagonist I liked less. 260 pages of whining. No empathy for anyone: poor Sarah always has it worse. Her mother (an admiral's wife) comments that deployments used to be worse back in the days before email. No, says Sarah, email is worse because there is more disappointed anticipation. ?!?   A friend suffers a miscarriage and Sarah has to be literally shamed into going to help her (Sarah doesn't like blood, you see). Nowhere in the remainder of the book is there an inkling of sympathy for this woman (also a military wife) who has had three miscarriages, the last one while her husband was deployed. It's all about Sarah (who has to babysit for the woman's older child).  Another friend's husband is sent home from the deployment and their family must relocate to California (from Florida) in a month. The reasons for this are not specified, but I can tell you that an officer isn't usually sent home early from a deployment for good behavior. Sarah's response? First, jealousy that her friend's husband is coming home; second, discontent that she (Sarah) will be losing her friend!  The worst, though, is her treatment of her husband, whom she is mad at throughout the entire book. To use one example only: Sarah's husband sends her an email -- one that would have broken my heart had my husband sent it to me -- in which he writes sadly that he will miss seeing their new baby's first smile, just as he missed seeing their older son's. Sarah's response to this? To be angry because that was the only email he sent her that day.   I finished the book only because I was hoping she would grow up! Nope, though. She was just as self-absorbed and whiney on the last page as she had been on the first. I came to Amazon and read the reviews and found several people who said something like "I don't know anything about the military, but now I have an understanding of what military wives go through." I hate the idea that people will read this tripe and think it is in any way representative of me, or of any of the fine military spouses I have known!  And this was a memoir! I can't imagine writing a book in which I acted like a spoiled brat from page 1 to page 260 and allowing it to be published with my picture on the front! Of course, Sarah doesn't think she is a spoiled brat -- oh no! Sarah pees champagne and poops gold bricks and is the white-hot center of the universe...  Once I finished it I threw the thing in the garbage. Yep, the garbage. Usually I donate books I don't want anymore to the library, but that didn't seem final enough in this case. So it's on its way to the York County Waste Treatment Facility right now. And I'm not a bit sorry! 
 Like most of the critical writing that is accruing about McCarthy's work these days, reading these essays invites the observation that academic commentary on great works of literature all too often appears as a perverse  sort of alchemy, an attempt to tranform bronze into excrement.  While  merely vexatious for those familiar with McCarthy's work, these  institutionally sanctioned forms of obfuscation,  however well-meaning, are  a tremendous dis-service to the uninitiated.  McCarthy's ambition is  biblical, ungodly; thus, his work is robustly defiant -- even scornful --  of contemporary professional exegesis 
 What is Mike Judge's problem?? This Volume has also been censored, just like Volume 1. Is this what is meant by Director's "Cut"?! As already mentioned here, Woodshop was butchered for no apparent reason. I'm not even going to watch the rest, as I have to expect other episodes to be censored also. It's a slap in the face for all the B&B fans out there. These DVD sets were Mike Judge's and MTV's chance to reconcile with the fans for years of censorship on the show when it aired on MTV but they screwed them up again. Shame on you Miken Judge and MTV 
 It appears the author has no idea what is going on with concepts of PLs. For example, he doesn't even touch on the ideas of follow sets and predictive parsing. His coverage of BNF and EBNF is light, at best, and it seems this topical coverage permiates the whole book.   As any CS student or educator knows, "Concepts of" books tend to be dense and difficult to read. This author attempts to make the material more readable at the cost of detail. Unfortunatley, the detail he leaves out is necessary.  I would also argue that the author doesn't have a strong understanding of PLs. The concepts he presents toward the begining on PL evaluation are incomplete. He doesn't fully express all of the important criteria in language evaluation.  Overall, if you are looking for a brief, topical INTRODUCTION to programming languages, this may be the book for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it 
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 first: I haven't finished reading the book and am not sure I will second: Donald readily acknowledges that there are multiple meanings to the word consciousness, he then takes one meaning "the creative engine itself, [...] the center of human genius". He even acknowledges that "this book proposes a theory of consciousness that [...] does not try to 'explain' how awareness could have emerged from a material thing such as a brain". But then he starts to slash against anyone (like e.g. Dennett) who tries to develop such explanations. He is so consumed in fighting against the 'hardliners' that his own theory is invisible and often rests on his (ours) intuition that there must be "somebody home". He even compares the telling of such theories with telling someone that his parents are "Jack the Ripper and Elsa, She-Wolf of the SS" (p. 45). Strong picture but weak argument.  I think his further arguments about complex interactions like an evening long conversation about a film has its merits, showing that there is something more about culture and consciousness, memory and inter-subject communication, than what someone like Dennett (or Pinker) is trying to explain. But that is the point: they are trying to explain a different meaning of the word consciousness: "How does it work on a basic level, how could consciousness 'become' and not how it evolved from there. So Donald in his attacks is comparing apples to oranges and that makes his book a pain to read. 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
    I was in a shock reading it - although an avid reader, I have never read anything like that. The author makes a statement, e.g. that it's a myth one drink leads back to a bottle, because the reality is that: a small number of people find they can have an occasional drink"... Strange logic. If only a few can handle it, it means that majority can't .    She also wrote that 0.4 0 level of alcohol is near-fatal"...No. There are people walking with level of 4.00 and more - yes, it is 10 and more times that near-fatal" one...    People interviewed by the author say things like: I will quit on my own, I don't need AA" - and they pay thousands of dollars going to detox, hospital therapies (some cost $1,500 a day, 10 days minimum - yes, fifteen thousand dollars), to psychiatrists, to others (whose success rate is abysmal - about 3 % to 5%; more than that quit with the power of their will), and cannot quit, keep on lapsing, etc...    They do not like this name -  AA" - and go to places with highfalutin names like Management System", Sober" and others like that...All of those programs were copied from AA" - either all 12 steps or 10, and many other solutions. What a pity.    AA is free, with success rate of 75 to 90% - and some doctors admit that... and AA is a way of life and of a character rebuilding. It is a panaceum and a recipe for correcting human flaws and becoming a better person, either you drink or not.    Almost all AA meetings consist of happy, smiling people with a few months or several years of sobriety; friendly, healthy, sober atmosphere. Agnostics, atheists and believers together.    It would help a lot to create an honest book if only the author went to a few AA meetings and read Alcoholics Anonymous" (the Big Book). Otherwise it is a claptrap with nods only from those who get remuneration from non-AA programs.  
 Do I care for this text? No. Do I think its arguments are supported well? No. Do I think that it is worthy to be purchased? Certainly. The reason why this text should be purchased is because it is a cornerstone in the radical  feminist debate raging over pornography. MacKinnon is bull-headed in this  text (unlike she is in _Feminism Unmodified_ where she actually admits that  women can and do enjoy sex... at times), but she is blatantly bull-headed.  This text should be purchased if only to refute it, but it is worthy to be  shelved on any bookcase that holds any texts of feminist theory. Does this  book suck? Yes. Does it deserve one star? Certainly, but its impact grants  it another star 
 I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.  This was the worst science fiction I have ever read. I can't believe I read all three books 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I had to read this book for an AP class, and it put me to sleep everytime i picked it up.  The author rambles on about the same things that went on in her life throughout the whole book, and she adds the most pointless details and situations.  The whole book is base don her views and opinions, so I really didn't care for it .If you don't want to go to the store to buy sleeping pills, just pick this one off the shelf and you will sleeping like a baby 
 If you are buying this book and are over 35, you probably already know you are too old to have good eggs, waited too long to have kids, or marry the right guy, and were selfish by focusing on you and your career during your 20s.  These two seemed to want to just chastise you for not grabbing the first guy you found at 18 and starting to have kids.  I also found them a little pompous (as in yea - I had fertility problems but now look at me I have two kids, ha ha).  Any woman who is going through infertility does not need this sort of info.  I found it almost cruel. However, I could have ignored the stupid criticisms if there was any really useful info in the book.  There wasn't.  Most of it was very basic.  If you are actually dishing out $25 for an infertility book you have probably already discovered cycle days and cervical mucus and the fact you need a fertility specialist.  Try another book.  This one is a waste of money 
 I read the book since I am building a house soon.  The book gave very little useful information.  I have been doing my homework on building a home and consider myself above average home building knowledge, but nothing I have learned came from this book.  I took the book on vacation this summer to read at the beach and I finished it in a day.  If you have some type of home building knowledge, you do not need this book.  I can NOT think of ANYTHING positive to say.  I wish I had another book to read at the beach.  WASTE OF TIME.  
 Tina is molested by her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father, until her mother finally tells her that he isn't. Tina is vague about the details of the abuse and doesn't actually say what happened, so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went. She prays to God many times to make it stop (why'd he let it start in the first place?), but God is not listening at those times. Finally after many years of this abuse, her mother catches them together, and instead of kicking him out, sends her daughter to a school out of town, with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day. The Lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together, and they don't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he's sorry (sorry that he got caught). Says it's just something about Tina that makes him do it.  Make sense? The mother works at Kmart and likes to have kids she doesn't care about, and the dad works "in an office".   The rest of her growing up is fairly normal. She has a boyfriend and he kisses someone else. Ouch. She goes off the college, and finds out her high school boyfriend is seeing her best friend. Tina doesn't seem too upset by this, she's busy with college and new friends anyway. Then he comes to visit her, tells her he got the other girl pregnant, but he really loves her. She quickly moves in with him. The other girl's pregnancy or resulting child is so unimportant that it is NEVER mentioned again. In due time, Tina gets pregnant by him and has an abortion. She says she regrets it. Gets pregnant by him again, has another abortion. Regrets this one too. However, she never talks about what her life would be like if she DID have these two kids by this loser. Nope, it just was wrong and she wishes she'd never done it, but never takes responsibility that is was her decision based on the circumstances she was in at the time. Having an abortion is just SO wrong, that you don't have to think about the consequences of actually having the baby. She seems to put the "blame" for her two abortions on society.  Talks her unmarried sister into keeping her unplanned pregnancy.   Breaks up with the impregnating loser, meets a "normal" guy. He wants to marry her, they plan big wedding with white dress and bridesmaids. She thinks she doesn't really love him, calls mother to discuss (why bother?). Mom tells her she better get married to this great guy. Tina decides she ought to do it in a few days before she changes her mind. Buys BLACK dress to get married in. Has small wedding. Has finished college, and EVERY job she wants, she GETS. Whines about working and traveling, so tired. Persuades husband to go back to college and get degree in engineering.   Husband is so smart that he figures finances and tells her they can afford a house. Has baby girl, his parents buy a crib she doesn't like (of all the nerve!). His mother tries to take over (helping too much)and Tina gets frustrated but won't tell her off. How much can a person be expected to take? Husband tells her she doesn't have to work anymore. They buy bigger newer house. Tina whines about packing and moving, so much work.   Gets pregnant with second baby (never notices when she's pregnant, always thinks she has a stomach virus). Getting depressed and tired with being pregnant and cleaning house, starts sitting in hot tub every night. Guess doctor didn't tell her this is bad for baby as it raises baby's temperature too much (already hot inside mother's body). Slips and falls on icy deck (not good idea to be walking on while pregnant), hurts back, whines some more.  Has second baby, too depressed and physically in pain to take care of self or both children. Medication not helping. Asks mom for help, she refuses, has to "watch stocks on TV for boyfriend" (has left husband finally). Guess husband's family doesn't want to help now? Church people help some, not enough for her. Husband begs her mom to help. She does. Twice. Apparently husband cannot figure out that he should put both kids in daycare while he works, pick them up after work, then  take care of them himself when they go home (just like a single mom does!) Never enters his head.   While Tina is at mom's house (not too depressed to  drive or go to mom's house), mom tells her to "snap out of it". This makes Tina snap for real, she jumps in car, drives to bridge, tries to jump off.  Cop grabs her (pictures are terrible, can't see what happened. Picture of car on bridge, wow).     Finally starts going to therapist, but her "faith" (now) helps more. Discovers "uplifting" Christian CD's. Faces fact that she and mom will never have mother/daughter relationship the way she wants it. Says mom saw her as rival for husband instead of daughter she should have protected. That's true.  This book is short (I read it at the bookstore), and its main focus is if you get Christ in your life, your depression will be lifted. But that makes no sense as she was praying and going to church all her life. Tina was searching, yes, but expecting to find the answer to her problems with God. This did not help before, and she seems to have tried to adjust things in her mind to make it that way after the bridge incident. The whole time she needed to look INSIDE herself. Yes, the abuse never should have happened, her mother was a terrible person, and all this affected her self-esteem. But she won't deal with it, won't get angry at mom or stepdad. Apparently she never sees any self-help books or anything like that, and relies solely on church and her "beliefs" to get her emotions in check (and this appears to be a very ineffective solution). By the way, Tina mentions that she cannot get physically helped by Reiki because it conflicts too much with the beliefs she's had all her life. The beliefs she's had ever since she was a child molested by her stepfather. Tina's not much of a one for upgrading her beliefs, which leads her to feeling stuck in certain situations.   Tina had a lot of things to be grateful for: nice husband and provider, didn't have to work, nice house, healthy kids, nice in-laws, college education, but she is not appreciative. Tina's almost constant whining about things that would seem very small to anyone else, negated any effect this book could have had on me as portraying a mother depressed enough to jump off a bridge. She just seemed spoiled to me.   For such a deep subject, this book lacked substance and seemed to tiptoe  around the issues. There is no calling a spade a spade - the whole thing is superficially written. Anyone who's had to deal with real problems, especially while depressed, will not "get" this book 
 Since many of the positives of this book were mentioned by other reviewers, I'd like to point out a few of the book's undesirable qualities.  First off, belaboring the point.  When I read a cookbook, each recipe doesn't specify to sift the flour.  That information is usually provided at the beginning and by inference is applied to all subsequent recipes.  When I read time and time again that Ed isn't using bottled oxygen, it starts to drive me nuts.  Yea I get it. You're the man.  You don't use supplemental oxygen unless you're a guide, so don't keep reminding me.  Maybe this style of writing was to make the record absolutely clear, I don't know.  For myself, I would appreciate an author more if they had faith in the readers to remember one generality placed in the beginning of the book.   Secondly, was this book edited?  On page 278 Ed says "I've always believed that you need to listen to the mountain and watch for the signs it's giving you."  Then on page 282, on the same ascent of Annapurna, he says "I've always believed that the mountain tells you whether to go up, stay put, or go down."  He just said this!  Even an amateur copy editor would see this and recommend removal.  Maybe this really isn't a 2nd criticism just a corollary of the first.  The negatives aside, the substory concerning the French hiker Jean-Christophe Lafaille was excellent.  And learning of Ed's early days in Washington racing up Rainier was pretty cool.  Ed's candor concerning other hiker partners is somewhat interesting, if almost risque.  I am thankful to Mountain Hardwear for providing this book for free......I would recommend taking it out on loan from the library because its definitely not work taking up space in a book shelf (there's little 2nd read potential here) 
 this is not a book on *SYSTEMS* architecture.  Like that book on Enterprise (SIC) architecture that was all about LANs and not the entire enterprise ,  this book has too narrow a viewpoint.    The title should be changed so it is not misleading. The author's perspective may be *his* system but to most of us this stuff is at best a  subsystem, or merely a component, or otehr lower level item.  if you want to know about SYSTEMS architecture the key book is rechtin and maier.  there may be a recent handbook of SA that covers a number of topics but eb and mark have the only real systems architecture book that I have verified.   this book is not the book the title claims.  
 Beautiful looking but the quality is sub-par to say the least. I had bought this piece along with two bowls which had plastic lids.  This one broke after one use, the lids didn't fit my bowls.  Poor to no quality control in this product 
 This is supposed to be "the" bible on Excell. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other "bibles" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, the will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Access Bible.. 
 I was disappointed with the quality of this item.  Little tike is a name I have learned to trust and this was a bummer.  The front broke because of it's poor design and flimsy plastic parts. So now it is just a broken dump truck. Also you have to push the button for the sounds to work. It is not motion sensitive.   
 Had the same experience an earlier reviewer had... the thing leaked like crazy after installation. The washer didn't want to stay in place and the two pieces didn't thread together snugly. Had to use plumber's tape to get it to stop leaking, and even then it was touchy. The worst was yet to come -- couldn't get the darn thing to hold itself upright. It's very top heavy (the head is about the size/diameter of a small pizza) and the plastic components just don't support it. It flops forward no matter what we do. That's fine for me, I'm short. For my tall husband, it's a nightmare. After about two weeks of use, the plastic piece that holds the showerhead cracked. I have to rubber band it together to keep it functioning, which prevents me from using it as a handheld. Today, I'm sporting a fat lip because the thing popped out of it's jerry-rigged holder and smacked me. Needless to say, I'm ordering something else today. It is such an inferior product I will probably never buy another WaterPik item -- suspecting they have abandoned any quality-assurance standards 
 The author was invited to speak to a group. In appreciation, the group presented a certificate to him. The "headline" was lettered in Blackletter (Old English), and set in all-caps. The author then told the group that whoever lettered the certificate would also likely steal sheep. He explained that 'one doesn't set Blackletter in all caps'. After reading that, I felt terrible for the designer, especially, and the group. The thank-you they presented was accepted with blistering sarcasm: openly, arrogantly, and callously.  Let me save you the cost of this book:  1) Don't use all-caps with display faces. Use it sparingly otherwise. 2) Limit use of several typefaces together. 3) When using more than one typeface in a piece, consider ancillary typeface-families designed by the same person. 4) Extreme arrogance is ugly and hurtful. Typeface transgressions rarely hurt anyone, although they obviously hinder legibility and the impact of the message. 5) Advice found elsewhere is more applicable, more altruistic, and better tasting 
 This book claims to present a paradigm for implementing games that learn.  In reality it's a book about a very specific implementation of a very  specific game. The "paradigm" is limited to a few very general  observations that you could have made yourself. 95% or so of this book is  code, and this reviewer was less than impressed with the quality. Clearly,  the code in this book was developed as a hobby project by a couple of  non-professionals who decided to make it into a book. They also decided to  ignore the vast body of existing work on artificial intelligence and make  simplistic claims based on their own experience about what is and isn't  feasible in a computer program. You should be able to find better books on  this subject than this one 
 I don't usually criticize a book too badly, but this one just isn't cutting it (or the light for that matter)...it's so basic that if you have any knowledge of basic photographic lighting, don't even bother with this one because it's all repetition.  I wanted to learn about lighting for subject movement and most of this is people sitting on their duffs (which is about 20% of the time)..you can tell the author photographs mostly sitting subjects - he may as well be a still photographer!  And when he talks about onset and offset lighting, he says arrange it until it looks good - nothing is said about broad or short lighting and how it can flatter a thin or round face....He forgot about the most important thing - the subject.  I teach a photographic lighting class, and this would not even be close to the book I would recommend.  If you really want to learn about lighting, buy the book called: Set Lighting Technician's Handbook for film lighting equipment, Practice and electrical distribution by Harry C. Box.  (this is really his name)....Anyhow, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my expensive copy of Lighting for Video - I may use it for my next subject to sit on to raise their elevation for a photo - that's about all it is good for. Sorry, but horrible attempt at giving good examples of real life lighting situations - MOVEMENT ! 
 Sissel has a wonderful voice (listen to Shenandoah), she is very pretty (just look at the album cover), but this album has no heart - it's carefully produced world-pop "lite."  What a treat it would be to hear Sissel take a few risks, using her voice to tell us about her heart, her soul, her pain and her joy 
      As a classroom teacher of all levels (honors, gifted, and Advanced Placement Language and Literature courses during the past thirty three years, I feel this book was a disappointment. Its title belies its contents. There was nothing new and inspirational for students that do not at least introduce an innovative new concept. I have been ordering from Amazon and keeping abreast with classroom texts for more than twenty years. I wasted my funds on this one 
 not funny,dumb plot,jim is not funny in this film, this is prolly the worst jim c. movie ever mad 
 Jack kornfield just doesn't know how to compose a sentence with any flair. He also makes unwarrented assumptions about how the world works and never defends them rationaly. The man doesn't have a critical bone in his body. This is just another example of nonsense that get published in the buddhist community and eaten up by unthoughtful readers. TERRIBL 
 The book tries to reinvent science by computer experiments on CA and to justify this by a shaky "principle of computational equivalence". It is way too much a stretch. There are various statements in the book which show that the author misunderstood what science is all about. An example is that the author mixed up the scientific methodology and the content of science with the method used to describe science. Among the various chapters where the author tried to account for the areas of science, the shakiest one is its account for quantum physics. I encourage the readers to read the chapter carefully to see for themselves. Anyway, after reading the book, I have to sadly say that the book does not have what it takes to support its claim. The author wasted too much of his time and the readers', too. Potential readers: don't waste your money on the book. If you need to read it to see how confused the author is, just check it out in the book store or from you local library if possible 
 When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing 
 I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran 
 This conclusion to the Year of Rogue Dragons trilogy was hamstrung from the every beginning with the lackluster plot and tone set by its predecessors. As the first two books in the series didn't exactly blow us away, I cannot say that The Ruin singlehandedly ruined the series, but it definitely left MUCH more to be desired. The Ruin made me so disinterested that only my status as a hardcore Forgotten Realms fan enabled me to truck through this book after several weeks and several sittings.  This once promising story is so devoid of any excitement, richness and character, I couldn't care less, with the exception of Pavel the priest, what happened to each and every personage. I could think of a lot of things, a rock for example, I could better empathize with. The author just seemed to randomly generate a band of 7 wildly dissimilar yet completely bland adventurers (a half-golem, song dragon, human priest, winged elf, halfing, ice dwarf, and a pseudodragon) and have them quest AND survive against humorously impossible odds. There is zero connection to them and the Forgotten Realms universe; the author might've well as written "abracadabra" and then have 7 adventurers appear out of nowhere to do battle with dragons. Cursory and transparent attempts were made at character development such as the love affair between the Dorn the half-golem and the Kara the song dragon (!?!?) but it is painfully obvious that this was nothing more than a page filler until the next gigantic battle. The redeeming qualities? It is a grandiose journey through a large breath of Faerun that includes Sammaster and Iyraclea and has plenty of varied and frenetic action albeit ill-conceived.   Needless to say, I expected more out of the talented Mr. Byers.  
 I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software.  I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.  
 I bought this book as a gift for someone who is a long distance grandma and thought it would be useful. I chose it after considering this and others available through Amazon. However, when I received the book I was surprised to discover the author peppers her writings and suggestions with Biblical references throughout the book. This is not something I particularily like and would have preferred for the review to indicate this. I have since returned the book 
 A formulaic thriller that includes everything but the kitchen sink - unrepentant Nazis, Basque separatists, an outcast murderous tribe of Eskimos, Canadian natives in northern Quebec, environmental activists and the usual female sex interest. This one goes beyond the pale and actually seems comedic at best. The heroes can thank their lucky stars that the dastardly villains resort to that time-worn cliche of gloating instead of getting on with killing them when they've got the chance!  This one's definitely a laffer! Give it a pass and save your pennies for the next one.  
 Honestly, I like Tony Brown. I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!  This book deals with his "Mama", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:  1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself. 2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose 3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race) 4. History: The value of investing in the future 5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself 6. Patience: the value of "Keeping the faith" 7. Love: the value of living joyfully.  As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the "to thine ownself be true" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.  Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.  
 Please don't buy this if you think you are going to be juicing carrots and apples and other hard vegetables. Because it is manual, it would take anyone forever to get a 12 oz. glass of carrot juice. I can get a glass of carrot juice in less than 1 minute with my centrifugal juicer which is a Juiceman pro. But, a centrifugal juicer can't do what this little juicer can do, juice grass and leafy greens.   I have mixed feelings about this little juicer.  First the pros. This juicer does a fine job of juicing wheatgrass. The pulp is dry and it is not hard to crank. Cleanup is fairly easy. It is portable. It is cheap. You get a slick dvd and extra parts. In an emergency this juicer would be an ideal survivor tool.   Now the cons. The so called indestructible plastic auger cracked after the first two weeks of juicing wheatgrass. I have to send it back for a replacement. Sometimes the crank hits the clamp or the edge of the counter. That means I have to readjust the clamp to make sure it is on correctly. Not a big problem but something you have to be careful about. If the lip on your kitchen counter does not protrude out far enough, the clamp might not attach properly. We actually have to open the dishwasher in order to have enough clearance for the clamp to attach under the kitchen counter. I ended up juicing in my backyard attaching the unit to the side table of my grill because of the clamp, the clearances and the drippy mess.  Next, the designers decided it would be best to reverse the threads of the end cap. That means in order to tighten it, you turn it counter clockwise. This is the opposite of every standard thread on the planet. It's confusing. In order to take off the end cap after juicing, you have to use the wrench supplied and use a moderate amount of force. I don't like it.  Also, the hopper body is hard to slide off the locking base. Sometimes I really have to push it. Next, the juice cup is very close to the handle crank. You have to be careful not to knock over the juice cup as you are cranking. Not a huge deal but again, something you have to put up with.  Lastly, when you slide off the hopper, there are some drips. Because you must attach the locking base close to the edge of a counter, that means some drips on the kitchen floor. It can get messy.  I bought an Omega 8005 electric juicer three weeks after buying this healthy juicer. The omega is terrific and has none of the problems I have with the healthy juicer. 
 The item itself deserves no stars, but the album deserves all of them--I compromised.  Such a great album with such a crap reproduction of the actual sounds made in the studio.  Unless you just want to hear the songs or you don't have a very discerning ear, don't waste your money on this tinny ish.  Either get a record player, or buy the UK import CD  with the original flag album cover.  Much better remaster there... though I urge you to go analogue 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
 Forget Summers, Father Satan has already dealt with him and all those hypocritical fools who thought they could play around with the demons, hold them in chains, and embarrass them. The demons are free now and anyone who wants to follow Montague Summers can join him in Satan's personal chamber of torment. That is his price to pay for agreeing with all those witchburnings, hahaha. I'm glad he's dead. May he suffer in Hell 
 As a nursing major the book was difficult to get through.  Possibily due to trouble outside of school.  Definitly not easy reading, but lots of good information.  I recommend this for anyone who is thinking about nursing 
 I bought this book because I love making miniature foods.  My major problem with this book is that on the inside there are only a few color photos and the rest of the book is pretty dull to look at.  The recipes seem okay but just the dull look of the pages make it pretty hard to get inspired to try any of these recipes.  I recommend just finding it at a library and not spending any money on it.  I have a book called "Finger Food" by Katharine Gasparini.  It has more savory recipes but there is a section for sweets.  This book is also fully photographed 
 I rate this book, Land of Hope, one out of five stars.  I disliked this book because to me, the story was too boring and obvious. Immediately, if you read about it, it says that the main character is struggling for her  dream.  It's obvious that in the end she'll end up achieving it.  The story  line was also boring because it was way too trivial and childlike.  Because  the characters didn't relly come to live and because the supporting  characters really aren't there to support it seems to lose any interest it  really held.  The plot could've been better had it more depth.  There must  be a million books like this out but much more intersting.  Life in A New  Country, which is part of the Dear America series is also about a jewish  girl who is immagrated to America, only it is better.       Overall, I  really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but since it is so short it  probably woudln't take long to read.  If it is used to see what it was like  in Ellis Island around that time I don't think it would be a good  reference.  Although the facts seem real,there really isn't much fact in  it 
 This is very weak coffee. Do not buy unless you like it that way 
 This CD is actually a bootleg and has been called 'Blue Asphalt' in other areas, I believe. It is not an offical PMG release and ,honestly, I'm surprised that Amazon has it on their site.  So the less then perfect sound quality is because it is a boot and, at best, was taken from the sound board and didn't receive any post production editing.   Another example of a Metheny boot is the CD of 'Parallel Realities'.  That CD is nothing more then the soundtrack to the DVD with some bad editing.  Tracks are left off of the CD that were on the DVD and most tunes are not faded in and out.  I wouldn't purchase these unless you are a hardcore fan that wants to hear some Metheny live and aren't too concerned about the aesthetics of the CD.  Just an FYI, I got stung by the Parallel Realities CD, but after a little 'research' on it, I discovered there are ulterior ways to 'acquire' both these CDs 
 Received the item with a small dent on top which I thought nothing of, shouldn't affect the performance I thought.  But when I plug everything in, the machine just makes a whirring noise, no water spraying, no movement of the dial.  After 15 optimistic minutes, I gave up.  Returning back for exchange.  Crossing my fingers for the next box 
 This book was a big disappointment. I was hoping for detailed instructions for the construction of a studio, and what I got was a refresher course in Acoustics 101. The book has a lot of theory which could be helpful to someone that doesn't already know about diffusion, absorbtion and reflection of sound waves. What it doesn't have is room dimensions, angles of walls, or decent illustrations. The illustration for a garage multi-track studio was literally a line drawing of a square with a bisecting line across the corner signifying what would be a disfunctional control room. If you're not ready to build a studio and want some good information on room modes and acoustics, this is a good enough book. If you want to apply these principles and actually build a studio, there are better instructions on several free websites 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I just could not comprehend why many music lovers love Bartok-- his music might be intellectual, but to me it's boring 
 I did not think that the book would have famed writers talking about their experiences in the world of sports 
 This is not so much a novel as a long story: barely 100 small pages with big print.  In my opinion Harry Crews is the greatest living English-language novelist; unfortunately, this is one of his lesser works, if not the least of his works.  If you already have everything by Harry Crews, try the DVD Searching For the Wrong-Eyed Jesus.  This is a pseudo-documentary about the South in which Harry Crews plays the cracker mystic.   
 Okay, so the Jaci Velazquez worshipers out there will want to kill me for this, but I don't think I've ever heard such an awful Christmas CD as this one.  I bought it as a gift for my wife, who adores Jaci, and my wife wanted to throw it away after listening to it.  This album goes to prove that just because someone has a good voice and strong talent, that person can't necessarily sing effectively in other styles, such as jazz, crooning, etc.  There are a few gems here (hence the second star) such as tracks 1, 2, and 11, and tracks 3, 4, and 5 are decent, but there are also some awful songs.  Her version of "Let It Snow. . ." is truly painful to listen to, and the remake of "The Chipmunk Song" is pathetic at best.  I love Jaci's contemporary stuff, but she's out of her element here, trying to pull off what Amy Grant did with her second Christmas album, and it simply doesn't work 
 Bubblegum disco , bubblegum cheesy songs.  Avoid it , try Salsoul , Philadelphia Int. etc, if you want to listen to the "real stuff"  
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 Perhaps the girth of this work makes it difficult to check all the facts, but I found gross inaccuracies throughout. The authors are biased and totally unconcerned with representing historical truthfulness. The references to Aaron Burr in this book are perfunctory, snide or downright malicious. The first mention of Burr I found was on page 241, regarding the Battle of Brooklyn, where the authors state, "Howe's dallying gave Putnam and the rest of the army, guided by Lieutenant Aaron Burr, time to slip out of New York...." They fail to mention that Burr, debating with General Knox as to the wisdom of remaining, took it upon himself to address the men and take charge. In the ensuing retreat, they met the enemy during which Burr distinguished himself with "coolness, deliberation and valor...His meritorious services to the army on that day, rendered him an object of peculiar respect from the troops..." (Wandell & Menningerode). Yet Burrows and Wallace merely accord him a perfunctory nod. 	On page 279 they state, "Among the new assemblymen that year was Aaron Burr, making his political debut with no principles to speak of..." Snide and unnecessarily insulting. 	Hamilton, on the other hand receives page after page of high eulogism and the authors take great pains to speak of him, wherever possible, with the greatest regard. In Chapter 19 they state, "Hamilton treated the convention to a remarkable five-hour lecture....."  I wonder if the Philadelphia Convention felt that enduring a five hour diatribe was a treat, though I must admit Hamilton's ability to ramble on at such length is indeed remarkable. The authors' choose words for Hamilton which are positive; for Burr, negative. 	They describe Burr when he was the front-runner for Jefferson's running mate as, "...too young, too pushy, too devious...," words they claim were said by "...many Democratic-Republicans...," though they fail to say who. They go on to say, "Burr even dammed Minetta Creek to create a grand ornamental pool by the main gate..." (of Richmond Hill.) By inserting the word, `even' they insinuate that he committed a heinous act rather than improved his property. Snide and misleading. 	In the five paragraphs dedicated to the "Interview in Weehawken," they state that the impetus for the challenge was Hamilton's remark that he, "...looked upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man, and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government." While Hamilton certainly made this comment, it was not the one that Burr felt was demeaning to his honor. It was the "...still more despicable opinion..." statement that compelled Burr to demand an explanation.  	Though several letters passed between Hamilton and Burr prior to the duel, the only reference this book acknowledges is, "Hamilton let it be known....that his remarks `turned wholly on political topics, and did not attribute to Col. Burr any instance of dishonorable conduct, nor relate to his private character.' Burr nevertheless demanded an `interview' on the field of honor." This cannily shifts the blame totally onto Burr, making Hamilton seem like an innocent victim, which he was not.  	Furthermore, in describing the duel they state that Burr aimed and fired, Hamilton fell mortally wounded and Burr fled. They fail to mention that Hamilton not only fired, but probably fired first. Again, by misrepresenting Burr, they lionize Hamilton. 	The section ends with, "...facing a murder indictment and fearing his house would be attacked by a mob, he slipped out of town into obloquy everlasting." This won a Pulitzer Prize? I think they wrote the passage just for the opportunity to use the word, `obloquy.' Indeed, if not for books and authors like these, Burr might get the recognition he deserves, rather than the kind of calumny they write. 	In a passage on prostitution, they mention Madame Jumel saying, "She did, however, manage a short-lived marriage with the equally notorious Aaron Burr..." Malicious. I could cite more passages where he is mentioned either with contempt or disregard, but I think the point is made. 	The bibliographical list for this book is so extensive, they can only list authors without titles or page references. I finally found Lomask (Milton) and Kline (Mary-Jo, I presume) mentioned, but I have to wonder if they actually read any books on Burr or took the time to study his papers. Surely learned people who do in-depth research should, at some point, come the conclusion that history has dealt unfairly with Aaron Burr and stop this ongoing character assassination. Burrows and Wallace seize every opportunity to denigrate Burr while neglecting to use a single accolade when fitting occasions arise. It is distressing that, in 1999, opinions of Aaron Burr remain this convoluted.  I do not recommend anyone to buy this book 
 This book was written in 1921.  Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself.  My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's.  My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there.  This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This book was a big disappointment. It seems half the pages are just print outs of forms, budgets, etc. The information tucked between the pages of forms is the same stuff found in many more comprehensive and readable books. It seemed to be written by a computer, not a person. The index is weak as is the glossary. These folks made one movie and thought they could tell the rest of the world how it's done. The hubris is only exceeded by the vapidity. Sent mine back for a refund 
   30 minutes into the movie, I was picking my toes and making shadow puppets; decided that was more interesting and turn movie off...nuff said! 
 I decided to try the Covington books because they were supposed to be in the same vein as Jan Karon's Mitford and Ann B. Ross' Miss Julia books.  I am a huge Mitford fan, with the Miss Julia books being some of my next favorites.  The Covington books have a good potential story line, but the characters are very two dimensional and spend lots of time discussing trivial things.  I found the dialogue to bounce around a bit, and some of the character's thoughts and actions seem to come out of nowhere, without sufficient background or detail being laid.  Frankly, I also missed having some humor in the story line, though there are ample places that it could have been incorporated.  I guess this is consistent with the "flat" feeling I had about these books. 
 I have to agree w/ 2 other reviewers on this board that basically stated that this author has a grudge against Clint.  The tone of the book is very negative toward Clint and does not provide a balanced approach to his life.  As a prior reviewer stated, the author would have us believe that all Clint movie-goers are idiots that wouldn't know a good movie if they saw one--nevermind that obviously, Clint has a huge fan base or his movies wouldn't have been so successful, nor would he be considered a Hollywood Icon.  The author takes every chance possible to take a dig at Eastwood.  I was very disappointed with the tone and negativity of the book.  I did not think he did a good job at all in painting a real picture of Clint Eastwood.  According to this author, Clint doesn't have a single good quality or trait.  I find that impossible to believe 
 I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between "wicca" and "witchcraft".  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to "chopping" of source materials. This is a waste of money 
 What Carroll and Graf Publishers desperately need is 1. a fact checker and 2. a proof reader.    Shameful display of factual errors. With sloppiness of this sort, why would I ever dream of believing the basic (and unbelievable)  premise.   Yvonne Adler  
 I used this book twice in two different classes, and it simply repeats everything one can find in a $20 creative writing book.  The readings selected are lackluster or horribly common in creative writing books already.    If this book were even $30, the content would not be so reprehensible.  However, with the hefty price tag, the pages should be littered with helpful tips that are new and exclusive to this book.  Burroway's "Imaginative Writing" is just as boring and hollow, but it at least does not gouge the pocket.   I would reccomend not buying this book if one is looking for a creative writing book.  Instead, check out "The First Five Pages" or "30 most common mistakes of Fiction Writers," both of which rest comfortably under the $20 marker.  For those who are required to use this book for a class, either don't buy it or purchase an earlier edition 
 You want me to actually write a review for this disaster? You might laugh if your IQ falls shy of 85, anything over that will make you realize what a dull, retarded, sorry excuse for a movie this is 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 I am afraid this is a far cry from the previous 3 books. Definitely not a gay romance though it does feature a gay couple who sadly does not take center stage though they are interesting characters. Eh..I can count the no. of pages really focusing on their story, 20 pages more or less towards the end. "Someone like you" resembles a day time TV soap opera, focusing on straights finding the loves of their lives, a gay man befriending straights, 1 bad guy and 1 cranky lady trying to add spice to a story which seem all over the place and of course let's not forget the characters' working lives! If this is the trend TJB's future books are going, they have just lost one fan. 
 Although the book does contain truthful and revelant empirical raw data, the author severely slants the truth (and even sometimes makes half-truths to the point of incorrectly naming Presidents) to the point of satisfying her own argument. Although Castro may very much enjoy her deptiction of the sustained need for socialism, my exiled family as well as my Cuban colleagues find the book disheartening as it weaves a fairytale for Castro as the glorious Savior of the Republic. The fact is that although the Republic did need change, it needed sustained political evolution, not revoltuion as found in the Castro regime. As my family is and comes from a family of Cuban politicians trying to advocate such change, her book is a tragic misinterpretation of those great ideals the infant Republic was trying to accomplish. If you are interested in knowing more about what actually occurred, not some socialist propaganda, watch Andy Garcia's movie The Lost City 
 Unlike most others who have posted here, I didn't like Ian's Walk. I found that the story spent a lot of time highlighting how different Ian was from other kids and completely ignored anything he might have in common with his sisters. I was uncomfortable with the author's decision to state Ian's autistic tendencies in such an outright way, since clearly everyone's experience with autism is difference. I walked away from this book, thinking we could have another Rain Man catastrophe on our hands. Everyone watched that movie and figured that they understood autism, when they really just knew about one fictional man with autism 
 It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac.. 
 Judging by the title, I was expecting a very interesting book. However, after only a few pages, my eyes began to glaze over.  With all the possible material to choose from, the author chose to focus on the "Baltimore Affair." I had never heard of this "affair" before, but now know that I didn't miss much.  The entire book is written more in the dry style of a academic paper than one for the general reader. While it may appeal to some insiders in the research community, to capture any wider audience the author needed to inject some spirit, graphic images, personalities, atmosphere, humor, drama, or anything into his account to spark some reader interest.  Fraud in science is a great idea for a book, but the author having grabbed the ball...dropped it 
 Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study. But as the previous reviewer has observed, however, all of the tales in this collection are instantly forgetable as they are trite in conception and poorly written. They have the collective depth of creative writing exercises in a first year class. I threw my copy away 
 By trying to show that science is multicultural-meaning either that knowledge is valid only within a particular socio-cultural context or that socio-cultural or political factors are imbued within the content of science, Harding disputes the conventional view characteristic of the scientific enterprise: knowledge accumulation, objectivity, disinterested inquiry, universality, rationality, unity of science and parismony.  She presents her case by employing a range of disparate arguments some of which are; 1) irrelevant examples, 2) her `strong objectivity' argument, 3) Western science is an amalgam of other cultures' sciences and technologies, 4) propositions are valid relative only to the considered alternatives, 5) radical philosophy of science claims, 6) mistaken blending of science and technology, 7) increase of knowledge creates increase of ignorance somewhere else, 8) linguistic modifications fill in for philosophical discourse, 9) `knowledge systems' are local.  I think none of these approaches go to any length in answering her question.  Below are a few of my responses to some of the above.  1)  Early on, Harding mentions Traweek's study of American and Japanese physicists but then we are told that Traweek didn't detect differences in knowledge production between these two cultures.  I wonder how this example is relevant.  Harding speculates about theory plausibility and geography.  "... cultures living on the edges of continental plates might well find the geology of plate techtonics [sic] more plausible (and "interesting"!) than do cultures with little experience of earthquakes, volcanos, and other phenomena characteristic of plate-juncture environments.  The latter may have developed geological theories based on their experiences of the vertical movement of the earth visible in mountain ranges--theories that appear implausible and/or uninteresting to the plate-juncture dwellers." (p64)  First off, which culture would come up with the extraordinary idea of plate tectonics or experience vertical motion of mountain ranges??  Alfred Wegener, the originator of the theory of continental drift was born, lived and worked in Germany and Austria.  After I plotted his various residences and compared it to earthquake hazard and volcano maps of northern Europe, I found that he resided in virtually the most geologically quiescent area in Europe.  Even the one volcano in Germany (the West Eifel Volcanic field on the west side of the Rhine river) was nowhere near any of his residences.  And most geologists of the time--even those who lived in high earthquake zones--gave his theory a cold reception.  This one major data point seems contrary to Harding's geo-speculation.  According to her, Wegener would of found his own theory highly unlikely. (...) 6)  On page 11, Harding first argues that scientific knowledge is created using technological practices and technologies.  Then she claims that scientific research is focused on creating useful or new technologies (which is not really the case).  She then concludes that scientific knowledge is inseparable from the technologies of its production which she then cojoins into one: technoscience.  This is simply fallacious.  Science, basic research, tries to answer certain questions about how nature works.  Theories or hypotheses *can* eventually be applied to produce new technologies.  Additionally, you don't have to have a science to have technical know-how... which is different from knowing why or providing an explanation or making a prediction.  Do other cultures have a science like the 'West'?  We don't know as none of the other cultures' sciences are ever discussed or detailed in the book.  As Lewis Wolpert states; "The motivations behind science and technology are very different.  The final product of science is an idea, or information, probably in a scientific paper; the final product of technology is an artefact--the clock or the electric motor, say.  Unlike science, the product of technology is measured not against nature but in terms of its novelty and the value that a particular culture puts on it."  (p31. The Unnatural Nature of Science.)  So just because science uses technology doesn't mean it automatically should be subject to the same value analysis as that of technology or applied science.  Some scientific theories or ideas may never have applications: black holes, quantum computing, gamma-ray bursts, etc.  Others have seen applications such as the laser.  Surprisingly, on the same page, Harding acknowledges that one can talk about technology without talking about science.  Unfortunately though, we don't really get this through the rest of the book.  Instead, we get science conjoined to technology which then gets blamed for all the hideous techno-environmental disasters.  But as Gross and Levitt point out in their hard-hitting critique of the postmod relativists and the like; "For every bomb there is a vaccine; for every ICBM, a CAT scanner." (Higher Superstition, 1997)  9) "...all knowledge systems, including those of modern sciences, are local ones." (px)  Harding implies that knowledge is infused with various geographical, socio-cultural, political, gender or personal biases of its origin of creation.  Ignoring for the moment that this local knowledge claim is actually a universal one, she argues that universality is a specific cultural and epistemic characteristic of the West and is actually used, according to her, to invalidate and de-value other 'knowledge systems'.  (Again, no real examples are provided.)  But we have to wonder how Relativity or chemistry for example, don't apply universally; or how they purportedly contain biases or de-value other local knowledge systems.  But if, as Harding states (p8), that scientific and technological ideas slip across borders as easily as air, then how can knowledge be `local'?  She also indicates that non-Europeans should have access to the benefits that international science and technology offer; but then, this is the same science that has supposedly destroyed, "de-developed," the local knowledge systems of other cultures.  We're trying to have it both ways here.  I would just say that the only real multicultural factor in science is in the composition of the scientific community itself 
 Very dissappointed.  My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  Audio just static and noise.  I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work.  Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you.  This is the last I purchase equipment on-line.  I will stick to books thank you very much 
 If you are like me, you struggle every time Microsoft changes ADO. We have to rely on "experts" and their books to help us through the ADO direction of year. Unfortunately, I would not use "ADO.Net 2 - Programming with SQL Server 2005, Oracle and MySQL" as one of them. After a slow start with database fundamentals not related to .Net, the book seems to start in the right direction and then quickly derails. The authors make a serious point about how ADO.Net 2 is suppose to help us develop against any database system, but then spends the rest of the pages bypassing this ability without informing the reader. So not surprising, the examples are confusing; not database agnostic, disconnected, abstracted and difficult to follow. Nearly all the example code only works for SQL Server 2005. The book attempts to recover with specific chapters for Oracle and MySQL, but is thin and short on examples.  I found something interesting from each chapter, but I personally would rather have just one reference book on each subject. With this book, you might end up needed additional references 
 This can opener works perfectly but the two gripper and cutting spoked wheels rusted early on. This can opener got a top rating from a consumer products review show but I wish I owned a can opener that didn't rust 
 I was mislead into wasting money on Jim Fay's audio book on toddlers and I think Amazon and other  booksellers have a responsibility to be honest with consumers about this series;   The author as a promoted as a "doctor" and yet the series is  about heavy handed fundamentalist Christian parenting.  I used to live in Denver, and because the authors made several references to Colorado I began to wonder  if this were something put out by the "Focus on the Family" extremist cult based in Colorado Springs;  I was right. The titles and descriptions are deliberately misleading, but if you click on the copyright link you'll see that this is where it came from.  When did these extreme Christian fundamentalist pass an amendment to the "Shall not lie" commandment? When did it become a "Christian Value" to disguise, mislead and lie about an agenda in order to sell something that they know the buyer would have avoided had we been given honest information beforehand?  For me, this validates the fear that a lot of people in Colorado had expressed about this group. It also shows how  much the extreme Christian right has in common with the Muslim extremist in Afghanistan:  Both groups are willing to disregard the core dictates of the  religion they claim to follow if it serves their efforts to make money or to impose their  beliefs on the rest of the word.  I purchased the "Toddler Love and Logic" audio book from this series, and after the first 10 minutes of listening  to the these two men laughing at (and sarcastically imitating  the voices of) mother's they've overheard making " mistakes" in conversations with their children, I realized the real mistake had been in wasting my money.  Why would they use "Logic" in the title of a book that tells parents that they shouldn't take the time to explain the reasoning behind the 'commands' they make to their children? And what is logical about using a child's bedroom as a punishment during the day and expecting them to  view it as a comfortable safe place at bedtime? 
 This book was not entertaining.  I suffered through each page.  I hated the plot and most of the characters.  I will never read another Doss book again 
 Daniel Pipes does not disappoint here at all.  He is a man on a mission making the most of recent events to make sure non-Muslim World turns and remains paranoid of all Muslim groups and nations.   What makes his kind of scholarship particularly devious is the fact that he is well armed with facts and figures that he uses very selectively and has carved himself a pseudo-academic position.  Though in this book even his usual rather thin veneer of fake objectivity has been thrown away.  His naked dislike of most things Muslim is scary.  Even scarier is how many consider him to be the voice of reason and truth.  The title suggests that USA is about to be overrun and destroyed by thousands of Muslim militants who have penetrated our society.  It is a call for "Jihad" in a way.  According to Pipes, only good Muslim is the one who has denied his religion and culture.  While any influence of Islam on politics of any kind is evil, the same criteria does not seem to apply to other religions.  While he urges all "good" Muslims to organize against the extremism, he also categorizes any Muslim organization as a likely front for extremist ideologies.  He seems to have a particular dislike of those groups who have been critical of US Middle East policies.  The fact is Islamic extremists in USA do not even register as a threat to this country.  The political influence of mainstream Muslims in USA, though numbered in millions, let alone extremists among them, is negligible.  There is no measurable internal threat from American Muslims as the author strongly suggests.  The irony and hypocracy of this deeply and militantly Zionist author extolling the virtues of disengaging religious zealotry from politics seems to have been lost on many readers.   Far beyond analysis, Pipes pretty much dictates what exactly everybody should be doing to counter this menace of Islam.  His audacity to lecture UN, US presidents, other World leaders and bodies in the pages of this book is just breath taking.  It is no wonder that Pipes almost completely focuses his wrath on Iran and Iraq (book written before the start of Iraq war), the two states in the region in a position to threaten ambitions of Israel.  One would think if Global "Islamic" terrorism were the main concern, Pipes would focus our attention more on Saudi Arabia which exports and finances some of the most extreme Islamic ideologies around the World.  None of the 9/11 terrorists were Shiites.  Pipes tries to make us believe that source of terrorism are theological, somewhere in the Islamic culture if not in Islamic teachings themselves.  He laments the attempts at politicization of Islam, while he is not disturbed at all by other ethnic or religious based regimes in the region.     This book is highly one-sided and represents a bigoted interpretation of not just the causes but also the scale of the dangers Islamic(?) terrorism presents to the rest of the World.  Pipes offers not a way out but a way to deepen the crisis in service of his ideology and causes. 
 1- President Bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on Pluto. Just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack.  2- A secret Cabal of Sceintologists have taken over the Defense Department and a working for Donald Rumsfeld who is actually L. Ron Hubbard come back from the dead.  3- Right Wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from Jack Abramoff in order to make money for Tom Delay's trial.  4- Samuel Alito is actually Pat Robertson under a mission impossible style mask.  5- Edmund Burke and John Adams planned the JFK assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations.  If you believe any of the above then you will love Brock's book. If not then its not the book for you 
 This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference.  Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am  trying to research. Works better than this book 
 This book is the reason I've read only one John Updike novel. I was so disgusted by the people, the plot, and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that I never read another Updike. I thought the characters were completely unrealistic 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 $80 for this?  Seriously overpriced.  If you can find something cheaper buy it, this is not worth 80 bucks.  Clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping.  Worked well with ribs 
 It's entirely unfortunate that Garrard has come to be considered the be-all-end-all of Gentilleschi scholarship.  While the hefty opus features a wealth of research and a moderately well-illustrated span of pages, Garrard's feminist arguments do not line up. Citing the artist's "rape" by Tassi as a motivating force in the creation of her paintings featuring strong female characters, Garrard corners much of her argument on the Susanna and the Elders Gentilleschi painted a full year before the encounter with Tassi.  Further, Garrard casts a 20th century feminist eye, and an accusatory one at that, upon the artist and her situation. She hardly considers the psychology of the 17th century, nor the legal definitions, where "rape" and its current emotional and psychological ramifications were hardly present. Indeed, court documents and statements show the artist and her father suing for marriage to save the family name; not once is there a mention of emotional hardship, but instead purely economic. Other sources depict a heated, smitten Artemisia, who continued her affair with Tassi for a year before discovered by her father, exposed, and forced to bring legal action against tassi. Conlusion: 400 years ago, forced sexual acts had not the same social identification of today, the psychology was different, and, honestly, Garrard neglects to illustrate the other sides of Artemesia and focuses on one event defining a life of artistic creation that, while reasonable for a 20th century situation, is unfounded for a Baroque 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 Amazon bills this book as Parerga and Paralipomena, but it only contains the Parerga.  The short essays, which made this book famous, are not included.  It is a complete ripoff and now I'm stuck with fixing their stupid mistake 
 The authors have not read their own references. On pages 339 thru 341, they describe Colebrook's equation as an expression that has been "fitted to the data." Colebrook describes his equation as "a transition curve that merges asymptotically into the smooth and rough-pipe laws." They describe Moody's friction factor curves as "average values for the data obtained from experiments." Moody describes his curves as plots of Colebrook's equation. His curves are also used to decorate the inside of the book's jacket. Have the authors read any of their references?  Prior to the time that the text CONDUIT FLUID FLOW was published in 2004 by D.May, the subject matter has been devoid of substantive relationships because the nature of fluid friction was not understood. The initial developments by Reynolds, von Karman, Prandtl and Colebrook had not been developed to finality. The state-of-the-art was frozen in time, and this incomplete and incorrect information is what the subject book is comprised of. Coupled with the numerous formulations in calculus that do not go anywhere, the book is not a credible learning tool 
 Like so many bad, bad movies, this book is a beautiful production.  It features slick, heavy paper; a million color pictures; attractive, readable typeface; witty contributors.  Its proportions seem just right for its weight.  But unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres (and many do), you're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure.  As somebody has already noted: No Iliad.  No Odyssey. No Aeschylus. No Euripides. No Boccaccio. No Chaucer. No Dante.  No Machiavelli. No Shakespeare. No Marlowe.   No Old or New Testament. No Q'uran. No Lao-tse, Confucius, Bhagavda-Gita (really short and really good). No Beowulf. No Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  In fact, only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion, one of them is John Lyly's Euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and, shall we say, "affected" works in English literature. You get John Lyly instead of John Milton.     On the other hand, you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000.  That's a lot of "classics" in record time.  How did they pick these?  And there's another 700 - out of 1001, if you can dig it, "you must read before you die" written in the 20th Century.  The 19th Century is well represented, I'll grant. Huck Finn is here - but not Twain's more complicated Letters from the Earth, The Mysterious Stranger, A Connecticut Yankee, or Pudd'nhead Wilson.    They also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like Lovecraft's "The Mountains of Madness" and Gogol's "The Nose."  Great stories, but two actual books had to go to make room for them.  Books like The Red Badge of Courage, for example.    Or maybe The Red Badge got crowded out by Justine or American Psycho.  This is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews, and look at color pictures of books. You'll find some titles worth pursuing, but you could do better, for starters, just by getting a list of Cliff's Notes titles and going on from there.   You can do that for free 
 It's difficult to surmise that Margaret Cho, who's usually funny (at least when you watch only one of her shows, and only once, because repeating the experience is often tiring), can write such a boring, unfunny book that feels like Chicken Soup for the Sexually-liberal Korean Soul.   Granted, some situations Cho describes ably, but she often winds up beating the humor into the ground, as with the incident when the producer grabbed her breast. Most of the book is annoying because of its italicized reflections and questions about the Self that are reminiscent of a diary of a teenage girl, but definitely not one of Cho's caliber.   And that's too bad. Cho had the potential to hash out a really great book here. It's sad she didn't take advantage of that opportunity. 
 Usually, Peter David's books in the New Frontier series are funny, entertaining and a pleasure to read. However, this storyline seems rushed. In previous books, Janos is introduced as a Mugato. Now, we are expected to forget anything we have read about Janos as a new background is written about him that seems, even in the Star Trek realm, hard to digest. I won't give away the details, but, this book is a disappointment, unusual considering the breadth of David's writing 
 In the introduction the author tells us that he is not concerned with social context but with "sexual shenanigans." This is unfortunate. The real story of these remarkable men deals with their  enormous contribution to American modernist culture before World War II.  Their sex lives are no more remarkable than any other bohemian group of  their day and Leddick's voyeuristic obsession with bedrooms and penis size  is ultimately boring to say nothing of discomforting. The endless number of  sentences that include the words "must have," "I assume that  they," "could have," "might have," "likely to  have," shows just how many cracks there are in the factual foundation  of this tawdry and disappointing book 
 The Movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack, spend your money elsewher 
 The Bloomsbury edition illustrated by Ralph Steadman is ABRIDGED. Do not purchase unless you are buying it for the drawings 
 This book was recommended by our book group but in spite of my best intentions I think I'm going to do the unforgiveable and abandon it. It's not as if the origins of life on earth don't interest me, I did my degree in Plannt Science. BUT I have got as far as p130, a fair test I think, and I'm finding it pretentious and tedious. Who has 20 page conversations with a geko?? What is all this nonsense with elves and the joker?? Unfortunately I can't be bothered to find out. In the words of a fellow book clubber who got to p50, "Life is too short" 
 I bought this book after see the movie as a child still great loved every minute of it 
 There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great.   Joni Mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of  times times over the years.    I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism. The lyrics are old and tired, and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale, too. The only good lyrics on this album were provided by Yates.   At least her paintings are good. 
 It's probably a great product, but BEWARE this is a 1GBx2 kit NOT a 2GBx1 kit as is implied by the listing and picture. Crucial's website is more accurate, showing a photo of 2 pieces as well as listing the item as 1GBx2.  If, like me, you want a single (2GBx1) piece, DO NOT order this item.   
 This item is advertised as boufant and oversized. It is anything but.... The shower cap is so tiny, it would fit on a grapefruit.This kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line 
 Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT! 
 This was awful. I'm sorry I spent a penny on this. 
 This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs.  It does not give practical advice on how to read auras 
 This is a truly unfunny followup to the classic Arthur.  Arthur and Linda are married, unfortunately not happily married.  They want to adopt a baby but first Arthur must sober up.  Even a visit by Hobson's ghost (Gielguld) cannot bring life into this uninspired sequel.  The original writer and director Steve Gordon died shortly after the original was released and it is obvious that it is missing his touch.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Watch the original 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Alan Riding's book-length description of the people and culture of Mexico is as broad as the Rio Grande, as sprawling as the Sierra Madre, and as dry as Lake Texcoco. Dated, too, published in 1985, well before NAFTA and the collapse of Mexico's long-ruling PRI party, but what really hurts the readability of this book is Riding's total disengagement from the subject.  "At risk of caricature, a typical Mexican family can still be stereotyped," Riding writes. "The father is the undisputed figure of authority who has little respect for - or communication with - his wife. He expects to be served royally at home, but he spends much of his time and money drinking with friends or visiting his mistress. He pays minimal attention to his children, although he carries great importance to having a male firstborn who carries his name. The mother, rejected as a wife and a lover by her husband, tries to alleviate..."  Riding goes on like this for a while, but I won't. What really annoyed me about "Distant Neighbors" aren't his generalizations (they may be perfectly valid) but the tone of jaded detachment behind it. He might as well be tracking hippos in Zambia for all the passion he derives from his subjects.  Another thing I had trouble with: What exactly is "Distant Neighbors" about? The title seems to suggest the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and he starts in that vein noting how odd it is two such different countries share so long a border. But the theme isn't carried through the rest of the book, which deals just with Mexico. The idea then seems to be the "distant neighbors" of class, beliefs, and ethnicity that divide this closely-packed country. If so, it is not drawn out.  Riding covers a lot of ground, though more with dates and statistics then by capturing the voices of real Mexicans. When he finally returns to the subject of Mexican-U.S. relations in the last fourth of the book, it's a well-observed narrative with striking observations, like how deep the wounds of the Mexican War still penetrate the Mexican psyche and how badly Mexican President Lopez Portillo got on with U.S. President Carter. Oddly, Lopez Portillo was friendlier with Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, despite the wider gulf in their ideologies; Riding notes deftly how this bespeaks a certain divide between rhetoric and reality where Mexican politics are concerned.  But for the most part, "Distant Neighbors" is a relentless, reflexively pessimistic book. "The system has in fact never lived without corruption and it would disintegrate or change beyond recognition if it tried to do so," he writes, as if one would be as bad as the other.  Worse, it lacks a sense Riding really invested himself of where he lived and worked for years as Mexico City bureau chief for the New York Times. Timesmen like Hedrick Smith ("The Russians") and Thomas Friedman ("From Beirut To Jerusalem") managed to produce books about past beats that give the reader a real flavor, and even zest, for the places and the people they describe. Riding, by contrast, gives you the feeling he couldn't wait to leave Mexico. In his hands, neither can you 
 I am a big Dr. Who fan as I've been following Tom Baker since 1980.  I started following him while stationed at the Learmonth Solar Observatory in Learmonth Australia from 1972-1982.  To me, this episode really put me to sleep (literally).  Sure it had the cheesey plots and cheap set designs but the story was too filled with technical jargaon that I found hard to follow.  I really like Tom Baker and salute him for a "good try" in this one, but I'll simply file this one away with my other Dr. Who DVDs and mayb e look at it again some other time.  Some people might like this episode but I believe it could of been better 
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 this book just reifies the old boy/girl dichotomy.  we have to move on from finger pointing to some real issues.  are we really to believe that boys are being harmed by feminism? poor things...  is there really anything inherent in being a boy or girl.  We know that there is not, so how can people still be making these passe and inflamatory arguments.  Give me a break.  
 This album is a failed attempt to get in the hipster dumbass club. 20 tracks of pretenious self involved crap.  There actually are a couple decent songs, but it also might be good if it was their 4th or 5th album, you when bands go to the desert to find themselves.  They just re invented themselves after being a band for about one year, when they should have stayed true to their roots. If you want to hear a good Willowz record, buy the first one "Willowz s/t".   Vortex 2.0  
 I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I don't give a hoot about movies and whatnot.  I havn't seen this one and probably never will.  But I bought this album thinking it would be interesting to see how Ry Cooder (I am a fan of his) would approach Robert Johnson.  Well, the answer is, he doesn't.  Ry Cooder does Ry Cooder: that deliberately floppy, sloppy sound I guess he and Little Feat patented.  One of the reviewers here seriously recommends this CD as an intro to the Blues!  LOL.    So, I say buyer beware.  NEVER buy an album without listening to it.  No matter who it is.  Ry has turned me off a bit.  Kinda expected to hear old time acoustic blues.  Like, say, Robert Johnson.  Silly me 
 I decided to read a book on the five-hour flight from MCO to LAX, and then on the return flight of something less than five hours.  (Flying downwind eastbound, of course.)  I purchased "The Aquataine Progression" by Robert Ludlum, in paperback form.  (I must admit that I still can't get used to spending $7.95 for a paperback book!  But, the horrors of inflation obviously continue to haunt us into the 21st century, and beyond.  This promised to be worth the price inasmuch as it was touted as a "New York Times Bestseller.")  I got to Page 17 of the 658-page book before I gagged.  I managed to read only a few more pages before I set it aside disgustedly.  I quote from the book to explain why:  "Lieutenant Senior Grade Gordon Ramsey had been hit by a fluke rocket that had winged out of its trajectory over the coastline and in on Ramsey's fuselage; the explosion had filled the jet streams" - - (etc).  This almost stopped me in my tracks.  The reason for my hesitancy being the fact that there is no such grade or rank in the US Navy as "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  My inclination is to think that a noted author like Robert Ludlum (or the editor at Bantam Books) should know that while there is, indeed, a rank of "Lieutenant Junior Grade" in the US Navy, there (conversely) is NO such rank as, "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  (The ranks of "Ensign," "Lieutenant Junior Grade" and "Lieutenant" equate to "Second Lieutenant," "First Lieutenant" and "Captain" in all other branches of service except the US Coast Guard which echoes the rank structure of the Navy.  Most confusing, of course, is that the rank of "Captain" in the Navy is equivalent to "Colonel" in the other services. )  I swallowed my disapproval, and continued to read.  But then, the author goes on to tell us that the skipper of the aircraft carrier, a Captain, calls in our protagonist, a Lieutenant Junior Grade, to inform him that he is being promoted to squadron commander after "Lieutenant Senior Grade" Ramsey met his fate with the rocket as previously mentioned.  Here again, I blanched.  A skipper of an aircraft carrier would hardly deal directly with a Lieutenant "Jay Gee" (JG, for "Junior Grade") to inform him of such a thing.  There are, of course, officers of intervening rank and intervening commands and responsibilities below that of the skipper of the ship. You would have other Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders, and Lieutenants who would be in the chain of command between the skipper and the protagonist.  If there's one thing that's paramount in the military, its delegation of authority!  It would certainly be somebody else who would inform the JG of his "promotion."  So, I had to swallow hard, again, and go along with the absurd notion that a Lt. JG would report directly to a Captain, let alone the skipper of the boat.  Then, while these two are conferring, a four-star general shows up unannounced via a tender to chew-out the Navy Captain.  Aw, come on.  Between the four-star and the Captain are three-star generals, two-star generals and one-star generals.  The chain of command would insert these people into the mix well before a four-star would come and deal directly with a four-striper, let alone "chew him out."  After all, one is ARMY, and the other is NAVY.  The ticked-off general would vent his anger through not only his own chain of command, but decidedly through the chain of command of the US Navy.  I swallowed hard, again, but kept reading.  Now, what happens is that the general proceeds to chew-out the captain while the JG is still present in the quarters.  BIG SWALLOW this time.  NEVER in military protocol or in the constraints of military courtesy would a senior officer berate a junior officer in front of somebody who was junior to THAT officer!  It just does NOT happen - - except in B-grade movies that aren't worth the price of admission.  Not only that, but we are now supposed to believe that the JG interrupts the general, and tells him that he's off base for berating the captain.  I almost upchucked!  The captain dismisses the JG, but he refuses to leave (yeah, sure!) and continues to give the general a piece of his mind.  (Yeah sure, again.)  After all, he's a hot-rock fighter pilot, and he's not gonna let some four-star berate the skipper that just promoted him to squadron commander, right?  The general absorbs the static from the JG, but "orders" the Captain to launch a strike despite the unfavorable and deteriorating weather over the target.  He calls the captain "chicken" if he doesn't order the strike, and calls the JG "chicken" if he doesn't fly it.  So, the JG and everybody else fly the mission rather than being labeled as "chicken" despite the previous critical decision regarding unfavorable weather (which, of course, is a ridiculous contention) and the JG gets shot down.  Okay, this is a far as I got in the book.  It's just entirely too hollow and too outlandish in its premise to entice me to read any further.  This sophomoric rhetoric brings this book down to comic-book level.  I can't believe the blurb that says this bookspent time on the best seller list of the New York Times!  But then, I guess that inasmuch as so few of the American public will spend any time in military service these days, this kind of bull-loney can pass for "real world" scenarios and the author can weave such bull-loney into a "believable" plot.  It's a shame.  And, so is this book!  Carl B. Jordan   
 The book is about court poetry, court architecture, court philosophy, and how well courtiers felt cultivating their court culture. It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture. The book is written by a bourgois raised and educated in safe homes and university bubbles but definitly not by someone who ever took part in creating culture 
 This book was given to my son as a text book and I had to correct the grammar and incomplete sentences before I could let him read it.  The title shoud be "Copy Kyla".  The page that starts "Got me some . . ." should read "I have . . ."  The pages are not numbered.  Only two pages are free of grammatical errors.  I gave one star for good illustrations and one star for the positive family life and small town atmosphere of the book 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 It is CONSERVATISM that is a mental disorder! In fact, that's a perfect description! Conservatives think that marriage has a magical "sanctity" and that allowing homosexuals to enjoy the feat of marriage will somehow cause the earth to implode or something. They also believe that everything should be ruled by word of the bible as a mirror of the Middle Ages, just like the Taliban. Liberals try simply to reverse this epidemic, but they are simply outnumbered. 
 I bought this book because i thought i can use the pattern in the cd provided, but unfortunately you cant use any of them, they saved it as flash animation format. Unlike the other book I have purchased "the complete pattern library" where you can use any pattern in the book and even change the colors of them 
 I have been a design student for about two years and I purchased this book soley through word of mouth.  I approached this book as if I was a beginner, knowing that the book was intended for such readers.  However, as I read through the pages and completed most of the exercises, I realized that if I had been a true novice, that this book would have been extremely difficult to understand and very frustrating.  In sections such as dividing a square, the author unclearly explains how to find the center of a square by drawing its diagonals, but fails to explain how to find the midpoints of the sides, and instead, assumes that you already know how to do so.  The exercises are the worst part of this book.  Like a beginner, I performed each exercise according to the author's instructions.  However, I always ended up with distorted images.  An example is when the author asks you to duplicate a cube in each direction.  Unless you are a machine, your cube will not be perfect and your duplicated cubes would only come out distorted.  But that is why a cube is already provided for you in the book for you to work on.  However, it seems that even professionals are imperfect, for when you duplicate the cube which is provided in the book, you still end up with distorted cubes.  As a beginner I would have been extremely frustrated.  I even asked one of my instructors to see if she could perform the exercise and she ended up with distorted  cubes as well.  Not only were the exercises frustratingly difficult, but the book's soft covers did not make it a suitable workbook.  Most of the time you're asked to work from off the sketces in the book, but the pages are constantly bending as you're sketching in it, and the illustrator's sketches are not very accurate in terms of perspective and scale.  I gave this book 2 stars because it does indeed mention good points when it comes to design, such as visual thinking, perspective, the "box method", and lettering.  But those points are not thoroughly explained enough and the exercises are terribly presented especially for a novice designer 
 This book is by no means a true story! It is totally fabricated and full of lie after lie after lie. The way Jim Shutze objectifies these troubled teens as sex crazed spoiled brat murdering monsters is absurd. I think Jim Shutze is a pedophile who got his rocks off while writing a fabricated pornographic novel about a serious and sad chain events that led to death of a monster. Check out Acceptable Sacrifice: Based on a True Story of Abuse and Murder if you want to hear the real story written by a friend of The main charecter. This book is a better read and more of a true story than this piece of crap smut book will ever be 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 I was disappointed with this book because it lacked a lot of detail thet would make the projects easier to complete. Also, the author spent way too much time explaining why the mods would not have any possitive results. If that is the case, why are they in the book?  There are a few pearls of wisdom but they are few 
 Tao is frequently translated as 'reason' in this translation and I personally believe that this is a folly and a fatal flaw. Tao can be reason, following tao is a reasonable thing to do. However Tao can also be instinct which is almost the opposite of reason. Most translations do not attempt to replace the word Tao with another, Tao is the indescribable, the formless, the nameless - to try to define it with a restrictive English word such as 'reason' is ill advised. Clearly defining Tao takes 81 chapters of philosophy and common sense, it cannot be abbreviated into two syllables 
 The first thing I didn't like about this book was the number of non-crock-pot recipes.  It's disconcerting to be reading a slow-cooker cookbook and find salad recipes.  Other books I've read give suggestions (such as, serve this with rice and a salad) but this is the first one to actually include directions for salads and rice.  If I want to make fried corn fritters I will refer to The Frequent Fryers' Cookbook and not a slow cooker book.  The second thing - and what prevented me from even attempting any of the recipes - was that I found inaccuracies in the book.  For example, the first recipe to catch my eye was "Lemon Chicken with Potatoes and Mushrooms."  Yet, when you read the recipe - there are no mushrooms!  Also, the steel-cut oats recipes suggest cooking one cup of oats for 2 servings.  My package directions and personal experience say that a cup of steel cut oats serves 4 once cooked.  These inaccuracies make me wonder what other typos are tucked away in the book.  
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake). 
 This book is terrible. It is very boring and way too detailed. He repeats everything for 10 pages and goes on and on about the slave traders. The names that he has for the chapters don't even talk about what they say they are going to talk about. This book is terrible and I don't recommend it to any on 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of "Life as a Forensic Anthropologist" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read "The Body Farm" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated 
 Wasn't that great compared to her other books. I was a bit dissapointed because I was expecting more of somthing like the Chrestomanci books : 
 While this 4-CD set does offer one of the most comprehensive collections of film music by the 20th century's greatest composer, I was very disappointed that they didn't have Williams himself conduct, or use original tracks from the movie scores.  [... 
 I can't give her a half a star? Yep, I heard Me'shell for the first time in quite awhile on XM Radio just recently. Her new jazz album is being featured alot lately, which is too bad, because I like Beyond Jazz on XM, but I have to turn to a different channel everytime I hear that dreadful sax player she's got playing with her. If you like "stress-free" jazz, definately stay away from this one. I like Me'Shell from back-in-the-day! 
 This book appears to have been originally published just before the NASDAQ crash in March of 2000. The copy that I purchased from Amazon.com appears to be a private re-publication of really first class quality by Ned Davis Reseach after the event. It was probably used as a presentation to clients and prospective clients to show the quality of his forecasting. Davis hit it right on the money. There is no doubt about that, and this book reflects his reasoning process before the event, unlike so many books written in hindsight.    
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 The story: A rabbit is magically gifted with red wings and a joyful ability no other rabbit has: flight. But he soon learns that To Be Different is Bad. The other rabbits, instead of sharing his joy, reject him for his special gift, as does his own mother. He soon learns that it's better to deny your own gifts than to Be Different; and in the end, voluntarily shorn of the wings that gave him so much delight and lifted him above other rabbits, he is again accepted by rabbitkind.  A stirring celebration of mediocrity, and a much-needed message to children with gifts and talents that they had better learn to hide them. If you enjoyed this book, you'll love Rainbow Fish 
 The authors have an introductory statement:  " We assume you are smart, if not give this book to someone else..."  Well, I assumed the authors were smart and obviously I made a wrong assumption.  The book is absolutely the dumbest thing I have ever read.  I tossed my copy in the trash.  
 I generally read about 100-150 books a year, and of that, there are usually only two or three I don't finish. This is one of them. I picked this up intrigued by the Du Maurier name and the premise of a union between the United States and United Kingdom. Alas, around halfway through this last of Du Maurier's seventeen novels, I realized I was bored to distraction by the tepidness of the satire and generally lackluster prose. The story is set contemporarily (it was published in 1972), and like so many of her works, in Cornwall. The idea is that a former stage actress of some repute and wealth has retired to a large mansion where she has taken in a series of orphan children, allowing them a great deal of freedom to develop their imaginations. To a certain extent, this character seems semi-autobiographical, and the way the children are raised parallels her own relatively unrestrained upbringing. One day the household arises to discover American planes flying overhead, marines landing on the shores near the house, and an announcement of a political union between the U.S. and U.K. This is apparently in response to some kind of European Unionish fiasco that is left to the reader's imagination. The real point seems to be that Britons will never never never become slaves, nor even the little brother to America's big brother. The household's first sighting of the Americans occurs when a nervous Marine shoots a neighbors beloved dog, which sets the standard for the subtlety of satire. Soon, the elderly lady is predictably leading a local revolt against the occupation, American soldiers are brawling with locals over girls, and so on. The problem is that the Du Maurier can't seem to decide if the story is supposed to be a satire, a farce, cautionary, realistic, or what. And since none of the characters were developed enough or interesting enough to care about, I realized my time might be better spent reading something else. 
 If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  The thing has got nonsense written all over it.  The "future animals" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST!  Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  A vortex? A posset?  What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  Can he please be institutionalized?  I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science 
 The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking.   If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit. 
 Macbeth V.v 25-30: "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."   Stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.  For literature, I choose Hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  Good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  I understand the story Faulkner was trying to tell about a Jerry-Springeresque southern family, but I didn't like the novel.  If you want to enjoy dsyfunctional American families with blistering social commentary watch 'South Park'-- much funnier.  I'll let one of Faulkner's contemporaries speak:  "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use." --Ernest Hemingway  Unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  If you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  You don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.    Faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work 
 The Cookbook is supposed to a smorgasbord of goodies, but when I listened to it, it gave me nothing but indigestion.  To me, this is the sloppiest of all albums.  No cohesion, no general theme, no substance.  Overall, album fizzles!  Grade: F 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 A true sell-out embarrassment.  I was shocked when I got this and slammed it in my player.  Absolutely terrible - and this after Mark & Brian's glowing interview on 95.5 KLOS (Los Angeles) with Joe Satriani playing live.  Jumped on my keyboard and ordered it immediately.  Man, what a let down 
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 I am disappointed with this book.  I was really looking forward to reading it since I own Baby Bargains and recommend it to anyone I know.  This is a huge disappointment compared to Baby Bargains.  Most of the reviews are pretty general, and as one reviewer stated, the information can be found on-line.  I thought it would cover a lot more product than it does.  I purchased the book looking for information on 2 separate items (umbrella/travel strollers and bike trailers) and was unsatisfied with the information.  Umbrella strollers aren't even mentioned, and bike trailers consist of one page with only one review.  Not at all what I had expected.  Had I flipped thru the pages before buying I could have saved myself a few dollars 
 I've owned this grinder for more than 2 years. I found myself use it less and less. The reasons being: 1]. It doesn't grind beans in a consistent fashion. The top beans are coarsely grinded and the bottom beans are Turkey-Coffee-Fine grinded. No matter how hard you shake during the grinding process, it doesn't help. Coffee still comes out that way. 2]. You cannot grind many at a time. Putting too many beans in the grinder will only worsen the outcome. 3]. As previous posters said, it is very difficult and messy to 'pour' out the coffee (if you can call it pour). I use brush, spoon, folks, chopsticks, and everything in between to take the coffee out. But there is ALWAYS something left behind. 4]. The machine cannot take grinning time continuously anything longer than 20 minutes. If you work it this hard, it simply stops work. You have to wait for 10 minutes to have it work again.  Rethink about buying this grinder 
 I just received this book.    When I saw it my heart sank.   I'd like to take my kids on the kind of road trips I enjoyed when I was their age.   My parents always found the scenic, as well as the fun places to take us.   This book struck out big time.   It doesn't give out useful info for planning a fun road trip.    I thought one of the previous reviewers was exaggerating when they said each state gets only two pages.   How can you learn what a state has to offer in a tiny amount of space?    2 pages it is.  On the bright side, I also ordered United States on the Road.   WOW.   Now that book is definitely a guide to planning a very cool road trip.    Beautiful photos and descriptions of plenty of places to visit (scenic as well as fun), history, directions, mileage, email addresses, phone numbers, price guides, etc.     I can't wait to start planning our trip!!      
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Total let-down. Hannibal Lecter doesn't even appear once. I really expected more from the interim novel between "Black Sunday" and "Red Dragon." There's none of the thrill or suspense that made Harris famous, instead it reads like a '70s pop psychology manual. Skip this one, read his later novels instead 
 There are alot of great pictures of arrangements in this book, but very little about the actual construction.  I bought 8 floral books and this was the only one that disappointed.  It does make a decent coffee table book, though.  If you really want this book, buy the used copy. You won't feel so cheated that way 
 I might as well re-draft this review as only 0 of 2 people enjoyed the first draft.  That's wouldn't normally phase me, but I can do better for you in this case.    I first saw a segment of ST-2 on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct-to-DVD release.  This ticked me off a bit because I'm a fan of Phil Tippett, who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie.    Having now got the DVD, I have unreeled it from the beginning and I find it loads more ambitious, intelligent and well rendered by director Tippett than I had given the producers credit for permitting.  Tippett has been an innovator in the CGI field -- stop-motion, go-motion, and transitional model-to-CGI models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures. Among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first STARSHIP TROOPERS movie. The multitudes of individually rendered creatures in STARSHIP TROOPERS are spotlessly realistic.    As a general rule, if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct-to-DVD release, they intend to suffocate the production -- whether the franchise has been good, bad or mediocre in the market -- by simply failing to provide a generous -- or even a minimal budget -- to sustain life support in any recognizable way.  Trust me -- starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises.    STARSHIP TROOPERS (the first) was not a runaway commercial hit on first run, apparently, when compared to its $100 million cost.  But sci-fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories, and it is certain that this ambitious sci-fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings -- and income -- for the rest of the studios' and the filmmakers' natural lives.  Nobody loses on this one.  A sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long-term.    Regardless of that, director Phil Tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film, he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget.    Looking at the bug war scenes in the first act, you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all.  Credit Mr. Tippett for that achievement.  In fact, there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie, which have added impact as a result.    Now for a few notes:  I would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new, logical ways.  I would like to have seen bug life-cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies -- what has been done and re-done in sci-fi productions as far back as ALIEN.    The creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped, exoskeleton, hive-bred civilization are unlimited.  There is no need at all for the writers or FX techs to resort to the over-used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human's mouth to another human mouth, for example.    Nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS to THE HIDDEN to THE THING that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal.  It has been done to death.  Let's move on and discard that whole much copied process.    I could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end. There is plenty of fresh, untapped bug behavior to mine, and there is far too much writing talent involved with the STARSHIP TROOPERS series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture.   Still in all, Phil Tippett's feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors.  I look forward to his future development as a director.    
 Frankly this book is terrible and I wasted my money on it. Capt Britain is the lamest character ever and it is only named Uncanny X-men to sell the books i'm sure 
 I loved the singles from this cd. But when I listened to it those songs were the only good ones on it.  
 Reading D Virue's dialog on Indigo children seems to have a lot of misunderstood premises on Ms. Virtue's part. She brings in much of her own biases and dogmatic belief systems. Read this with an open mind so to see through the heavy belief systems of Ms. Virtue, as it contains some poignant truths about Indigos 
 Any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what's actually going on in the Middle East is purely coincidental.  What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.    Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.  The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.  However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.    I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that 
 I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad 
 The monitor looks really nice, small and stylish, that is probably it.  It is probably the worst monitor we have tried.  Yes, we read all of the instructions and did the measurement exactly as suggested. The worst part is that you can measure it five times and you would get five totaly different numbers. We returned it and bought a Omron cuff based monitor 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 I have no complaints about God's holy Word, but this actual book is NOT leather bound as described but is made of Leatherflex, which is a plastic coated imitation. I returned my order 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album 
 I will never purchase another Neutrogena product, again.  There products are dangerous!!!  It burned my face.  My face is all red, swollen, red, irritated, and itchy.  My new best friend is Cortizone 10, the anti itch cream.  It's been a week since I stopped using Netrogena, and I still look horrifying!!!!  Perfect for Halloween, right?  But, Halloween is over, and I still look scary.  This product has aged me!!!  It has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen.  NEVER, AGAIN, NEUTROGENA!!! 
 When you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating. Otherwise the flavor wasn't bad. I just can't eat the dirt. It's bad for the teeth 
 I changed from quicken to Quickbooks and regret it.  Yes, Quick Books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but I have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards.  I have also found it difficut to match transactions.   To get a better handle on my expenses I am going back to quicken or try another program.   Online help and tutorials, "dummies guide.... not helpful either.  You would think see they make quicken they would allow import of QIF files. dissapointed.  
 If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star.  Media code: MCC 01RG20.  2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008 
 It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the "new" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love 
 I had read that Dave Eggers is friends with Sarah Vowell and David Sedaris and had hoped that like company meant like creativity.  Unfortunately I found Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius to be extremely lacking in the creative department.  I will not give up on Eggers just yet, however I'm just confused as to how A Heartbreaking was a Pulitzer finalist.  The story lacked continuity and Eggers' attempts to wrap himself in the tragic balcony accident suffered by his friend were tacky at best, pathetic at worst.  A Heartbreaking is worth reading, but I caution the reader that it is a definitely underwhelming experience.  
 I wasn't that happy with the book. Seeing the personal post cards the Beatles sent to each other over the years seemed like a good concept. I guess it looked better on paper than reality. For one thing, there aren't many postcards.Two: They are just the average postcards anybody gets when someone travels, except more boring. Nothing more than "having fun, see you soon". That's about the whole lot of them. Each postcard has a one or two line Ringo quip about it. Sometimes they're interesting, mostly not. The only good thing about it is the fact that it was only $10.00 and some or all of the profits go to charity. Even a die hard Beatle fan won't find much to love about this book 
 Promising topic for a comic novel; lousy book.   Parents trying to get their beloved and perfect offspring into the best schools are more than ripe for satiric portrayal. But the satire in this novel is dull and predictable, and the characters are all simpering stereotypes. The schools are even given names like "The Bucolic Campus School," "The Very Brainy Girls' School," and "The Safety School." Well, at least it's easy to keep track! Nancy Lieberman definitely does not tax her reader too much.  The villainess, the grasping and pretentious embezzler Pamela Rothschild, headmistress of "The School," possesses not a single good quality and is a criminal to boot. In not quite enough contrast, the heroine, the slim and glamorous art critic Helen Drager, is shallow, unsympathetic, and not above crassly manipulating her husband's position as a producer for the Cooking Channel for personal gain. Her doting husband Michael is such a complete pushover (except for once when he screws his courage to the sticking point and *gasp* withdraws one of his daughter's high school applications) that the reader wishes Helen would just consummate her affair with the wealthy and recently widowed art collector Philip, who talks like this: '"I find you incredibly attractive." His gaze held hers.' Instead, the two neck on a sofa one afternoon.   Who is the audience for this dreck? Given that the novelist Judy Blume (authoress of "Tale of a Fourth-Grade Nothing" and "Frecklejuice") wrote the blurb, one suspects it is the students portrayed here (or their younger siblings) rather than their parents. At least one hopes that there aren't enough adults who like this book to have taken it into paperback. I'm embarrassed that I finished reading it 
 I have purchased many books on the U.S. Constitution. This book was okay,  but compared to others it only deserves one star. My two favorite books  which I would give five stars are The U.S. Constitution for Everyone, and  The U.S. Constitution & Fascinating Facts About It. Read the reviews  for those books and you'll see that many people share my opinion 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G.  Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time.  Sorry.  I vote two thumbs down on this one 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 roger ebert has his own individual tastes and I respect that.  I have my my own tastes too. Ebert thought "the pillow book" was a great film. He didn't like reservoir dogs. Don't adhere to this guy's recommendations. Anyone who does should read a story called the emporor's new clothes and reflect on the moral 
 Do NOT!! Order from this website! I purchased a subscription for Oxygen magazine on Jan. 30, 2006, and I still have not received the first issue. I am very dissapointed, to say the least! 
 Peggy Noonan was the Monica Lewinsky of Ronald Reagan's presidency -- although, in my opinion, she was both prettier and, on some obscure level, smarter.  Therefore, her memories, while somewhat clouded by years of alcohol abuse (as she herself admits in Chapter 69), are more interesting than Monica's -- and Peggy had the brains to burn her dresses after mating!     George W. Bush has a passionate interest in war and terrorism, both of which he wages well, but he uses the word "freedom" as a shibboleth.  He believes that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and China are "free" because their interests suit his purposes.  Meanwhile, he has invaded Venezuela with hired Miami thugs.   What are we to make of this?     Bush is amazingly lenient on the subject of the late, unlamented "Pope" -- he treats him as a beloved colleague, rather than a partciularly weird cult leader who liked to wear a dress.   For those of us who think that "Rum, Romanism and Rebellion" remains a real and present danger, this is a little bit disgusting.  But Bush's strong affirmation of war and terrorism is refreshingly honest -- and even his meek affirmations of "freedom" are somewhat amusing, given the whole picture.    After "Tugboat Babs" Barbara Bush, Noonan is probably GWB's strongest female supporter.   It is refreshing to read such an honest avowal of female hunger -- although it is clear that she will always miss her "Ronnie-poo."        
 I have decided that since so many people are obviously blind to how dumb this play is, I should write a review to enlighten anyone that might read it.  The humor is dated and because of that, very boring.  The situations are completely inconceivable and it makes no sense!  The characters are flat and serve no real purpose.  I suggest that no one else ever ever read this play 
 Ted Rall is a cartoonist and in way's we can say that he lives in a cartoon world. He very much wants to believe in the greatness of socialism, he wants to believe that everything good in this world has arrived from socialists and that everything bad comes from conservatives. Living a life like this is hard and causes one to make gross fabrications. To Mr. Rall superman, spider-man and wonder-women exist. But to us, slightly more well adjusted persons, we view these characters as fictionalized cartoons. Unfortunately Mr. Rall's book is that of cartoon-land so filled with these fabrications, that it really becomes a work of fiction.   It goes without saying that from the-1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. In essence we do have a one party system, Socialist party A or Socialist Party B. But there are still some differences.   Rall doesn't quite understand that in our current situation, in which Democrats, whose domestic policy are carefully tailored to benefit a narrow socioeconomic segment of wealthy individuals, unions, lawyers and fringe special interest groups has become unpalatable to the average middle class American. Across the country, from California to New York, the hard leftist democratic candidates were unable to motivate their own base, let alone attract the center voters required to win close races. What Rall doesn't seem to get is that the Middle American doesn't view the Democrats as targeting the Republicans as opponents, instead the Democrats target America and the way of life that Middle America lives.  For example, Teddy has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts "that favor the rich" Unfortunately this hard-left mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!   It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.   Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.   If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.   Ted and his ilk are so out of touch with the average Middle American that this doesn't make sense to him. They don't understand that people don't like being lied to. The biggest problem is that Ted believes that you can say whatever you want, this doesn't work anymore. With today's access to information you can show a lie so quickly it just doesn't make sense to say one.   For example, Ted lies about 2000 election on just about every count. First of all the state was called for gore 70 minutes before the polls closed in Florida. (Sorry Ted your lie that it was 10 minutes is patently false.) This early and fraudulent call was a concentrated effort by the liberal media to help disenfranchise the states voters. Democratic (yes, democratic) pollsters put the number of disenfranchised voters at between 10,000 - 15,000 that decided not to vote in the panhandle region. This, btw, is predominantly republican country.    But what is even more appalling is that the exit polling by all major news outlets was showing that Bush was winning. The extent to what liberals will do to swing the vote unethically in their favor is atrocious.  Gore's slide into win at any cost came quickly with his lawyers filling a petition to stop the counting of oversees military ballots. These ballots, btw, were never counted and added to the official total. Since most of them would have voted Bush and by counting the disenfranchised voters Bush easily won the state.   Now remember, the only reason the Supreme Court got involved was because the socialist state judges refused the follow the law. Gore only wanted the most liberal of all counties to be counted, but the state rules said all the counties had to be recounted. The first Supreme Court decision was 9-0 the second was 7-2, both of these decisions said in effect that the whole state had to be recounted. Ted's argument that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction is merit-less, the presidential election is FEDERAL not a state election.  In the end the state recounted the ballots 4 different times and in all 4 Bush one.   Then a bunch of hard left media outlets got together at a cost of nearly $1 million bucks to try to PROVE that Gore won (NORC).  Cartoon-boy tells us that "Media Consortium Statewide Count of `Undervotes' and `Overvotes' Proves Gore Won Under Any Standard." (PAGE #)  This statement is blatantly, undeniable False, a big fat Lie and you can download the NORC document yourself. The NORC reports that they recounted all of the votes using 9 different methodologies. Bush won eight out of the nine and he won by a larger margin than was officially certified.  Sorry Cartoon-Boy your lies are great for the socialistic automata; for me I prefer to remain in the middle and support the truth. 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  The author places emphasis on the use of one brand of irrigation equipment, seldom mentioning other options that may better fit the application.  I also found several errors in the  enclosed calculations... not simply a typo, but in the methodology of the  formulas. I would not recommend this book.. 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Becarfel this is a region 2 release. Chances are that this will not play on your DVD 
 If anyone is new to the Dark series by Christine Feehan, you absolutely need to READ DARK PRINCE FIRST.  Feehan introduces a new race of paranormal humans, and you need to know what about their Carpathian/vampire universe.  Also, what happens in this book deals directly with what happened in Dark Prince.  Dark Desire is not standalone.  After Dark Prince you can almost pick up any of the other books.  Dark Desire has very little romance in it, so if you want to see some romance, don't bother.  It's just one big pool of blood and torture.  People are strangled, stabbed, staked, shot, mangled, manacled, healed and then injured again, bitten, bled...it just doesn't stop!  Oh, and they have a lot of sex even whey they are still bleeding.  Whatever.  And you almost need a scorecard and a handy family tree to piece together who did what and which people are being healed and by whom, and who else is near death at any particular moment.  Not that I want to be babied through a book, but everything happens awfully fast. and it seems that way too much goes unsaid with these people, as if Feehan didn't bother to organize the nebulous mass in her head.  There are too many characters and too many sideplots.  Think of it as a cross between a gorefest and a soap opera.  Suffice it to say that everyone is okay in the end.  So now you can get this from the library and skim to the sideplots that you're interested in. (for me that's the Gergori subplot).  On the whole it's not a disaster, but NOT great in terms of a romance 
 Readers would be better served by reading "The Intelligent Asset Allocator", which has the same core recommendations with regard to saving and investing, but much harder data on asset allocation (which provides >85% of the explanatory variable in overall portfolio returns according to most academic studies), following those recommendations instead, and then going out and just living their lives instead of vainly seeking some "new life around the corner, if only I had another $(fill in the blanks) million" by spending their hard-earned money on these investment book du jours 
 There was something a bit corny and cheesy about caia that just didn't appeal to me.  There's a warm, all engulfing fuzzy feel to this disc but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  It seemed a bit too over produced and the music came across as murky and muddled.  I tried selling my copy at three different used music stores and no one wanted to buy it. If you like your downtempo a bit cheesy and forgetable, the magic dragon is for you. Not a single track reached out and grabbed me and the disc kind flowed in such a manner that eventually every track started to sound a like. I was finally able to unload my copy.  Not a bad disc but there is SO much better out there 
 You call this a complete or essential collection? there is nothing and I mean nothing on this double disc from "The Ultimate Sin" album. I hate when record companies skip over albums when putting together a retrospect of someone's carrer. "The Ultimate Sin" album was a BIG seller when it came out back in 1986 with such hit's as the Title Track and "Shot In The Dark" as well as other great album tracks "Lightning strikes" & "Never Know Why". How shallow can you get!!!! 
 ...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved 
 Well-researched biography, maybe; however, I found Robb's patronizing tone towards his subject to be distasteful, offensive. A more objective account--without a lurking sneer behind it--is in order. 
 After enjoying the Charlie Brown Christmas for several years, and Boy Named Charlie Brown more recently, I found the Good Grief CD to be so completely different and unpleasant, that I could not even listen to the whole CD, and will not be keeping it.  
 This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap 
 I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.    One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".    I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.  This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.   
 Despite the apparent maddened horde out to discredit this book (some of whom appear to have not even read it), I found the book interesting, if flawed.   As others have pointed out, the book is overly long, and does contain a lot of needless speculation (especially on Silvia Odio) and exposition.    Nonetheless, it does offer an interesting take on such things as: the identities of the "three tramps", the links between Oswald and Ruby, Oswald's DOD ID card, the relationship between Oswald and the FBI, and Ruby's gunrunning activities.   In short, it's worth a look if you have the time. Just skip the chapter on Silvia Odio.. 
 Check it, So I got my new headphones I had been waiting 2 weeks (free shipping deal) for and when I opened the box, I was like, sweet, these look pretty tight.  Then I went to put them on, ya know, test them out, and the darned things would't fit over my big dome. I went to adjust them and i was like, they can't be adjusted! I went to lift them up and Oh snap... them things snapped!! I got mad and threw them against the wall, packaged them up, and sent them back. I still havent received my refund.. 
 Verbose, annoyingly pedantic, and rarely to the point, this text is a disaster from start to finish. For students who have little to no research experience it will be overwhelming in detail (unless you find reading formal style manuals to be a joy). On the contrary, for the more seasoned researcher certain sections will likely appear dubious or downright wrong, insofar as the text has a strong bias towards a certain social scientific approach (which is subject to learned academic debate, a point students should be made aware of). It essentially presents the research process as take it or leave it, encouraging a investigative framework that leads to inevitably trite conclusions. Additionally, it reads like a car manual with many sections repeated verbatim when the need arises for them to be referenced a second time. Finally, it uses examples of students work that are of questionable quality as positive examples, rather than well written, notable published pieces.   In conclusion, this would never be an appropriate guide for a students at elite research universities, nor would it be an efficient approach for students at less vaunted programs. 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger 
 I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea.  HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEA  A friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time.  Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back.   Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips. 
 a friend of mine bought this to check it out... wow was this crap... the guys should just bring Max back 
 Loved the book, but this abridged version sucked out the rich textures of the story and the wonderful characters.  In the full version, I loved the Donoghues and each of their stories, and I hated that the book came to an end.  I cared about these people and what happened to them, and found the historical backdrop a  fascinating setting.  This abridgement completely skips the sisters' stories, and fails to create that same bonding with the characters or the plot, and even changed some vital elements of the story.  Skip this abridged audio version and read the full text.  It is a treasure, and this totally fails to do it justice 
 The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details) 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 Perhaps my expectations of this book were too high, but with all the experiences in her life that she had to portray, Joyce Maynard comes up woefully short in holding the reader's interest. Her early passion for J.D. Salinger becomes a seething hatred, with the acclaimed author seeming no more than a curmudgeonly near-pedophile. And, for all the exorcising of her demons and the details of her private life she attempts to share in this book, she is surprisingly light on revelations. I wanted so much more, but found that she used pages to go out of her way not to tell more. It's frustrating, and an ultimately boring read. I was very disappointed 
 This book is just one of those books covering everything, and actually nothing in detail. 
 I only read "Loving," but let me tell you, that book is the worst.  Every fundamental rule of writing is broken is this "book." Yuck! I mean, the last line of the book is really "and they lived happily ever after." Puh-leeze 
 I had thought that this was going to be a day to day calander (its not). Besides that it seems like Mr. Larson has lost his touch with humor, I wont purchase another one next year 
  "LACE AND WHISKEY"  REVIEW:  This has to be Alice's most inconsistent album. The albums only real standout tracks are "It's Hot Tonight," "You And Me," the funny "King of the Silver Screen" and the gut-wrenchingly sad "I Never Wrote Those Songs". But this album may be home to the worst Alice Cooper song and that's the Chas Underwood-penned track, "Ubangi Stomp". Both "(No More) Love At Your Convienence" and "My God" aren't very good either while "Lace And Whiskey," "Road Rats," and "Damned If You Do" are nothing more than just decent.   THE PLAYERS:  Dick Wagner - Guitars, Vocals  Bob Ezrin - Keyboards, Vocals  Steve Hunter - Guitars  Babbitt - Bass  Tony Levin - Bass ("Lace And Whiskey," "Damned If You Do," and "Ubangi Stomp")  John Prakash - Bass ("Road Rats")  Allan Schwartzberg - Drums  Jim Gordon - Drums ("Road Rats," "Damned If You Do," and "You And Me") Jim Maelen - percussion, vocals  Jozef Chirowski - keyboards  Al Macmillan - Piano ("Damned If You Do")  Al Kooper - piano ("Damned If You Do")  Ernie Watts - tenor sax and clarinet  Venetta Fields, Julia Tillman, Lorna Willard - Vocals ("Road Rats")  Douglas Neslund and the California Boys' Choir - vocals   INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released in April of 1977, "Lace And Whiskey" peaked at #42 on the Billboard Top 200. Despite having a Top 10 hit single ("You And Me") this has yet to be certified by the R.I.A.A for sales in excess of 500,000 copies sold.  2. "You And Me" would later be covered by the late Frank Sinatra at the Hollywood bowl.  3. "Lace And Whiskey" was Alice's highest chart placing album in Australia at #3.  PACKAGING:  The front and back cover are cool concepts while the booklet does feature the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  40 min. and 16 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  This was Alice's worst album up until this point but it is intriguing to listen to if nothing more than to wonder "what the hell were they thinking?". This is - however - the worst Alice Cooper album that Bob Ezrin has produced. **1/2 out of 5.   
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end.  I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted 
 If your looking for a basic arrangement of songs, then this book is decent. It is lacking in a majority riffs and solos. Do not expect to buy this book and get each song tabbed out entirely, or each song tabbed like it is played on the album. Its a good place to start, but overall I was unimpressed 
 I was extremely disappointed with this camera.  It's a shame there is no option for zero stars, because it doesn't even deserve one.  I bought two of them for a vacation to Belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water, and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera.  Now I really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can.   All of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible, terrible quality.  The camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water.  Those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of.  Extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water.  Not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none, so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives.  I was so disappointed in this camera that I wrote to Kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras.  Unfortunately our trip to Belize was a once in a lifetime trip, so I have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done.  And I have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. If you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories, DO NOT waste your money on this one.  The only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment.  I wish I had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it 
 On almost every chapter of this book the author just scratches the surface on interesting subjects and will reference other books instead of completing and going deeper into the subject himself. I didn't give a lonely star is because I did find some little bits of information. By the title you would think that it's a book to have; not so. If you can browse it, don't buy it.   
 This movie was boring, confusing and seemed pointless.  After her boyfriend is shot and killed in a convenience store, Courtney Cox goes through a difficult adjustment which includes a blur of reality and fantasy. We see her remembering the incident several different ways. Now, reading this description it would sound like the movie is intriguing and would be interesting but it isn't. With a premise that has potential the writer and director manage to create a dark, confusing and (worst of all) completely uninteresting movie. I was amazed that it was under 80 minutes because it seemed soooo much longer. I felt no connection with any of the characters, and found Courtney Cox's character the least engaging of all. The characters seemed two dimensional and the plot (if you can call it that) was pointless. By the end I just didn't care what really happened. Skip this one 
 Gosh....., where can I start, I buy it combine with Complete Epic Series, I found it no much diffrent.  CES also have this episode.  Amazon should advice the customer clearly pertaining this matter before the customer buy it.  Now I'm facing difficult to sell it back to amazon due to the locality of my country (Malaysia) and its very difficult to find fans of BSG (old version) in my country in order to sold it off.  So should there any BSG fans in my country who read this, I'm willing to sell it around RM30.00 (very good condition)   I can be reach at : 019-756740 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 I was very disapointed with this book. It seems the author is very fond of talking, but forgets to make conclusions, and is essentially going nowhere. There is no "red line" throughout the book. But let me be more specific. My problems with this book are :  1 : The author spends about 70% of the book talking about the sorroundings of Rennes-le-Chateau, telling us about lots of small villages and paths. But there is no map in the book!!! This makes it impossible to follow the author unless you actually live in the area.  2 : The model mentioned in the title only occupies the last 30 pages. This is a shame, because it seems that this is where the author has some superior knowledge.  3 : There is a lack of structure in the book. It seems like a conversation has been written in form of a book.   My conclusion(!!) : Buy this if you own all other books on Rennes-le-Chateau. It has some speciel knowledge. But otherwise avoid it 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 If people want to read a book that is more objective about this case please read, "Unplugged, Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America" by William Colby.  Mr. Colby is the lawyer for Nancy Cruzan, a case very similar to Terri Schiavo's, so he is very knowledgable about this topic.  He does not denigrate either family and approaches the subject of dying very even-handedly.  Reading either the book by  Michael Schiavo or the book by the Schindlers is an exercise in futility to me.  Both sides have their own opinion of what happened and are obviously very biased to their own point of view. This is a very dysfunctional family that will never agree with anything the other says simply because they do not like each other, and readers should understand this when they read their books. In between all this name-calling and accusations lies the real truth, as it usually does, and no one, especially the public, knows that real truth.  This is a case that should have never been so highly publicized, it just brought out the kooks and all those people who like to hear and see themselves proselytize on TV (including politicians) These difficult decisions are quietly made every day in this country (since the Quinlan and Cruzan cases) without any fanfare and this case should have been no different. And anyone who thinks "starving" Terri could cause the massive brain damage seen on autopsy is just plain stupid.    Anyway, don't bother with this book or any of the other family-versions unless you want reinforced what you already believe is the truth......read something that is unbiased, objective, and neutral.      
 Heinlein's first attempt at a novel stayed locked away, unpublished, in a drawer until after his death for a reason.  As a story, the plot does not flow and the characters, although very smart, lack any real depth.  This was Heinlein's extended diatribe on how he thought the world should be.  Heinlein is probably lucky that this book was not picked up by a publisher.  In the fifties, he would have went to jail for writing such ideas. This book is great as a comparison read to see how much Heinlein changed from his idealistic youth until his libertarian death.  Some of the predictions are true, but, at this time, Heinlein really underestimated how much technological development would come in the near future.    I recommend this book to Heinlein fans as a comparison or beginnings work.  I would also recommend this book to economics students as they would be the only ones to truly grasp the economic scenario laid out towards the end.  It could have been more.  I think Heinlein recycled what he thought he could use in other stories.  If you want to read some Heinlein, there are other better selections to choose from.   
 I found this novel aesthetically pleasing, well written and interestingly structured, as well as witty in places, but hardly hilarious as others here have suggested. Regarding the book seeming to be written by a female (with all the presumptions of enlightenment that that carries with it - in this text and in literati generally) due its satirical reworkings of phallocentric myths and legends, I would say that the first 'novel' in history by Cervantes did just that, so phallused author's have a decent tradition in that area; having said that, this comment made the course material of my literature course at university, so you can see how pervasive it is. I don't blame the book for its strident and parochial feminist/misandrist and postcolonial themes - there is almost a complete cultural saturation of it. The book works in very well with current literary theory and should be used by all like-minded people as a text to place new 'Portias' and 'Shylocks' in different racial/cultural groups - same sort of hatreds with different wrappings. It's a shame, because King's talents as a writer are very great, despite the ideolatry. 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 I ordered this book as a Christmas present for a budding novelist, and I also ordered a copy for myself.  When the "book" I had ordered for myself arrived and I found that it looked like a photocpy from Kikos, I was incredibly embarrassed to have given it as a Christmas present.  For the price I would have expected it to be bound or have stated otherwise in the descripion. I cannot believe I received this quality of product.  There is nothing that could be said in the content to compensate for this and I will never buy anything from this author again.  It is hard to believe anything he says when he can't really get his own book "published" 
 If you want a non-technical, easy to read introduction to artificial life, then this book is for you. But, if you know anything about programming, then you will be disapointed.  It has not a single line of code in the  entire book, and is short on detail on exactly how things work. Stephen Levy did it better years ago with 'Artificial Life'. The only thing better about 'Virtual Organisms' is that it covers a few things that have happened since Levy.  If Levy were to write a new edition including the new material, then  this book would be totally superfluous for serious readers 
 J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument.  He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said.  There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character.  It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.  Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it.  Otherwise skip this tiresome read 
 Yeah this is not a biased approach at all!! My eyes are rolling up in my head from the massive quantity of sarcasm....  This is not a good approach at all.....  Money is a valuable thing... don't waste it on this book.  
 Just a guy sitting in a field talking about sex.  I really did not see any new sex now.  I wouldn't waste my money if I were you 
 I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved "The RM".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it 
 very cheap, you can tell it's an fake camera miles away. sure it has these features of motion detector which makes it move and has led lights; but not worth 6 dollars at all. stay awa 
 A friend recommended that I should get their CD because they rock! So I did. Boy were they wrong!!! These guys suck big time. Just another cookie cutter pop/rock (boring) band of today. I will never buy a CD of these guys ever again and I will never listen to my ex-friend! 
 Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though 
 This book is mediocre at best. It offers invalid practice tests and too broad of a summary on each thing. It doesnt pinpoint what is on the Ap exam very well at all. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The best resource is the textbook by Miller. When i bought this book, it took 3 weeks for delivery and is more expensive then other publishers such as barrons and princeton review. I knew that these small unknown publishers would not meet up with my expectations and         i though i was proved wrong with these miraculous reviews. Trust me, you wouldnt be a "smarty pants" if you buy this book. 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 I know that Taiyo Yuden manufactures quality professional blank media but these are from from it. There is no proof on the CD hub that identifies them as Taiyo Yuden. Already I have had 2 out of 10 CDs that did'nt record any data during a live church service although the Tascam pro unit we use showed that recording was in process. Buyers beware!   
 I am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs. Amazon's listing says this Innotek trainer comes with a "lifetime warranty." I've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars, so I decided to review the owner's manual to learn more about the warranty.  [...]  The last page has a section entitled "Lifetime Limited Warranty," which states ". . . INNOTEK brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase."  The "lifetime warranty" apparently expires after one year!  Further on it says, the company "offers several product exchange options during the warranty period. . . . Costs are dependent on the processing time."  This suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year "lifetime" warranty.  The next paragraph says "After one year from date of original retail purchase, we will repair, replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component."  What will these repairs cost?  This leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from Innotek.  What, if anything, is warranted for a "lifetime?"  If the lifetime warranty is really only for one year, why call it "lifetime?" And finally, what will repairs cost, both during warranty under their "product exchange options" and afterwards under their component-based "fixed rate?"  My specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery. The manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable. Does this mean the user will have to send the collar to Innotek to replace the battery and, if so, what will it cost?  I have contacted Innotek through their website and will report back if I get a response. Until I do, I've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty.  Can anyone comment on warranty claims to Innotek 
 I have no idea why I saw this movie in the first place, perhaps it was because The Jungle Book is a fascinating story. However I was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly   (in a stupid way).The action scenes were terrible. I recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies. 
 This "biography" is one, long malicious attack upon Carl Sagan.  Keay Davidson obviously detests Sagan - so much so that I don't know why he would wrire a book about someone he hates so much.  Only someone who hates Sagan could enjoy this book - but anyone who hates Sagan wouldn't be buying/reading a biography about him anyway.  This book has no real audience.  I would rate it ZERO stars if I were able.  If you like anything Carl did, please look elsewhere for a biography and do not waste a penny or a second on this unfathomably putrid piece of attack-journalism 
 If you are forced to watch this movie, imagine that the Pauly Shore masturbation scenes are meant as a clever comment on the movie itself. There is little other hope for preserving your sanity 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM 
 This book has a touchy-feely self-absorbed New Age feel to it. I see that most reviews for this book are positive but this one is not. If you lean even a little toward the evangelical and/or fundamental, please consider the following:  Walsch claims God could be a woman (or without gender). He refers to God as "She" and "Her" in spots.   There are too many references to all of us being One. We are not "one"; we are individuals, created by God to be individuals with different gifts to use in His service. It is He who equips us, not we who fit God into a "friendship" relationship -- this is simply not scriptural. In John 15:14, Jesus says, "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." This denotes a higher-to-lower hierarchy, one which is repeated throughout the Bible. Jesus (God) clearly states He is in charge and in a superior position. But Walsch's writing does not convey this. It conveys an equality, implicitly, that he and God are on equal footing. This is offensive.   In his hubris, Walsch writes, "It has been two thousand years since the birth of Christ, twenty-five hundred since the time of the Buddha, and more since we first heard the words of Confucius, or the widsom of the Tao, and we still haven't gotten the Main Questions figured out." [We haven't?] "Will there ever be a way to turn the answers we have already received into something workable, something that can function in our day-today lives?" [Many of us have done so by following the Bible.] "I think there is. And I feel pretty certain about it, because I've discussed it a lot in my conversations with God."  [I see.]  Walsch calls himself a Christian but places other religious figures on equal footing with Christ. Jesus never left open the option of truth claims to ANY but His own. Christ never offered a one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B faith. In the guise of thinking outside the box, Walsh reveals his own religious pluralism.   In Scripture, God tells us to fear Him (not a craven fear, a Godly fear). God tells us to worship Him, obey Him and come before Him in humility and in supplication. I see none of this reflected in the pages of Walsch's book. God is my Creator, my Saviour, the Love of my life Who loves me. But He is not my friend; He is God, far above friendship. On this earth a father can be a friend. In God's realm, God is God and not on equal footing with anyone. From Walsch's writing, I got a creepy feeling he was lecturing and explaining to God things God may not have known.   The last straw was the following paragraph where Walsch is justifying the large profits he makes on his books (not that profit is a bad thing): "Is Ted Turner less valuable than Mother Teresa? Is George Soros less of a good person than Che Rivera? Are the politics of Jesse Jackson, who appears to have plenty of the good things in life, less worthy than the politics of Vaclav Havel, who may have less? Should the Pope, whose very garments cost more than it would take to feed a poor child for a year, have his words called blasphemy because he lives like a king as the head of a church which owns billions? Ted Turner and George Soros have given away millions of dollars. They've empowered the dreams of humanity with the rewards of their own dreams, lived."  Turner, Soros and Jesse Jackson are not role models for most people I know. Walsch seems to set them up as such.  Walsch writes the following self-absorbed, misguided statement: "It's as if we somehow know that if we can learn more about one another, we can learn more about ourselves. And the yearning to know more about ourselves -- about Who We Really Are  -- is the depest yearning of all." No, Mr. Walsch; the deepest yearning of all is not to know more about ourselves: It should be to know more about GOD. It is He Who will teach us what we need to know about ourselves, if anything. Americans are already too self-absorbed. We don't need more of it.  Perhaps it is just me but I found this New Age claptrap just a bit over the top, not biblical and certainly not the kind of Christianity I'd like to see spread around. 
 this cd is really good and boasts many talents, but...like the old gloria record ep, it gets old. if you've never heard this kind of music before, then get it by all means. but if you know of mineral, you'll probably like mineral better. it sounds a lot like u2 and radiohead. i see them live a lot, and basically, i've been disappointed lately. i used to think their music meant something to them. the last time i saw them in austin, they looked bored. i don't know...maybe the boys will cook up something new with their new music. let's hope so 
 Should have thought twice about this one -- it's really big and a very garish green. Not worth sending back, so I guess it will go to a yard sale.. 
 I loved Peter Robinson's "Gallow's View." "A Dedicated Man" slipped a bit. Now there's this one, which I didn't even finish. Too much procedure, not enough Banks. Not enough Jenny. The poor wife is nonexistant. That's where the story lies, not with Maggie's Farm. I will try some more Banks, but I don't know if I can keep going if they fail to engage 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 This book was written in 1930.This book was about a artist and his cat. Their was a high preist that came to the artist to ask him to paint a picture of their Lord Buddas death.This painting would include all the animals that came to be blessed by budda and a cat who refused budda teachings. The artist's cat good fortune was so happy that the artist painted a cat that she died and went to heaven from being overjoyed. When the priest saw the painting he was angered and refused to hang the picture in the church and the picture would be burned.I didnt have a favorite line in the story and Personally I wouldnt recomend this book to anyone. 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 Don't let a propoganda wheel fool you of the truth  1. The Miami Herald gained access to all Florida ballots and did their own recount, at their own time --- who won? BUSH! ----- http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-03-floridamain.htm  2. There is a case that African American voters were turned away - however, where is the same case for the many Haitan American voters who were also turned away in droves, who are known to be sympathetic towards Republican causes  The filmmakers had a chance to make a point about voter rights and election problems - they turned this to an attack against President Bush and Republicans instead  Sadly, their message will only be heard by Bush-haters, instead of the world, because of their decisio 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 Upon hearing about the controversy surrounding steriods and baseball, I was remotely curious about Canseco's "tell-all" book on the subject. However The self proclamied "Godfather of Roids" book talked more about shifting the media bias than steroids. The entire book Canseco whinned about how Good Ole' American boys like Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken were beloved heros, and Latin players like himself were cast away. Jose allegedly named names... All this guy did was RAT on fellow teamates. He is below scum, and he wants to portray himself a Mystical figure who took ILLEGAL drugs to keep a wish to his dying mother.  The book was difficult to read and only sold books because of it's shock value. Now I can see why i hated Jose so much as a kid growing up an avid bay area baseball fan. I wouldn't recoomend this book to ANYBODY! If I could I would give it negative 5 star 
  The three MD's who authored Sugar Busters have discovered that sugar is bad, but haven't learned about all the other horrendous things that have happened to the American food supply.   Sugar contributes to disease, they say, sugar makes us gain weight and we should avoid it. So far so good. But turning to the meal plan we find a bewildering array of processed and denatured foods: High-glycemic whole grain extruded cereals like Whole Grain Oat Cheerios and Shredded Wheat `N Bran; reduced fat triscuits; lowfat milk products; lite mayonnaise; and MSG-laden Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce and canned chicken broth.   Reduce saturated fats, they advise, but fail to mention the problems of trans fatty acids.   Diet drinks containing neurotoxic aspartame are fine, according to the writers.   This book is a good example of that old saying: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.   From Sally Fallon at westonaprice.org. 
 THE LORD OF THE RINGS   I was a teenager back in the mid and late 70s, and JRR Tolkien's popularity was inescapable. I started reading THE HOBBIT, which is a little prequel to this. I don't think I finished it, and I know I never tackled THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I found Tolkien hard to read. Imaginative, sure, and no doubt thematic, but it was like Margaret Mitchell. Unreadable. (Don't start -- I'm from the South.)   Later, I saw an animated version of the trilogy on TV which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes. Naturally it made no sense, because you can't compress all that into such a short time span.   Then, I gave up on Tolkien and played another game of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. I was addicted, folks. Role Playing Games are an author's playground. I didn't play as much as I wanted, because I was too much in demand as a Dungeon Master. Naturally.   But now, in this millennium, let's watch some movies! I live in China, where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan. For those keeping score at home, about US$2.50.   THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING   It was a bit slow getting started, presenting all the back story, but I was surprised later on when I needed it and remembered it so well. Okay, yep, Tolkien's got game. Given his popularity, one would sincerely hope so.   You absolutely have to love the look of Middle Earth. How are they able to adjust everybody's heights? Most of the special effects are impressive.   Most importantly, somehow I feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to Tolkien's vision. In fact, I read somewhere that he did.   I never found elves quite so annoying in my Dungeons & Dragons days as I do now. I bet they never sweat, do they? They talk in riddles and glow too much, but I guess that happens when you live too long.   The various species are quite distinguishable, aren't they? So are different members of the same species. This is masterful. It's a skill far too few modern authors possess. Either everybody in the book seems like the same person, or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort. Tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that, yes, sometimes it's reassuring to a person/character to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require.   Once our fellowship finally goes into battle, we get some great sequences. Among many fine performances, those of Frodo and Gandalf stand out in my mind. Oh, and "never toss a dwarf," which I KNOW Tolkien didn't write. Anxiously awaiting part two.   THE TWO TOWERS   What's more boring than real world politics? Fictional politics! I don't believe Tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect. Well, I hope he didn't. Saruman makes a bunch of uber-Orcs and sics 'em on humanity. Fine. We don't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles. Nor do we need the lamest excuse for a "love story" in cinematic history.   But once we FINALLY get past all that, I believe we get back to the Tolkien vision. Here's hoping we stay there for part three.   (Two hours, two paragraphs. What's wrong with this picture?)   THE RETURN OF THE KING   A balanced attack. That's what THE TWO TOWERS lacks but THE RETURN OF THE KING has. By this, I mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring. That's not your "action," unless your name's Jackie Chan. Give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point, then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater.   {No hate mail from Jackie Chan fans, please. I love SHANGHAI NOON.}   The real drama comes in the interpersonal, and in Frodo versus that @#$%^* ring. Gollum is one freaky deaky, ain't he? Liv Tyler is still unwatchable, but fortunately her screen time was minimal.   We get very close to the end of this film before Hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes. Those very cool elephants, for example, seem unstoppable. I was quite impressed with Orlando Bloom's quietly effective performances, but I'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas. Those elephants are doomsday machines, and the heroes' strongholds were Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Meanwhile back at the ranch, perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility. Sam the Hobbit versus HOW MANY orcs? Um, lest we forget, he's only a freakin hobbit!   I don't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps Tolkien himself. But, well, somebody damn sure did. Let's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what's on the other side.   Unlike some critics, I appreciated that this film didn't end at the "climax." We needed some more time to just hang out in Middle Earth, well over 9 hours after we entered the place, without all that pseudo-violent cast-of-thousands FX crap.   However, anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead, and that includes the entire elven race. You can leave your Shire without leaving your world, Tolkien. I did. I've been in China since 1999.   THE VERDICT   I appreciate Tolkien's imagination, and I'm glad the film people made this. But I know it could be so much better with an editor. Yeah, I'm talking about changing what Tolkien wrote if required.   (There goes another subscriber...)   I read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they don't think Tolkien wrote enough. I disagree. I think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better.   (And there goes another subscriber...)   Nothing about this movie changed my opinion. I was happy to watch it once, but I can't imagine anyone wading through it twice. I've swapped it for a copy of the GODFATHER trilogy, which I'll review in a future issue of WHO MOVED MY RICE?  
 ok.. I'm picking on Dave because I'm not a big fan of his voice... his voice sounds like Eddie Vedder gone way way way wrong....this is especially true with 'Rhyme and Reason'....   yes, I know Dave was born in South Africa but Paul McCartney was born in Liverpool and actually managed to sound American soulful... so what is it with Dave... I mean, he can sing in tune... and his band is really really good... I guess in the end... I'm just not a big fan of the finished product..  The albums starts out all right and 'What Would You Say' is a good song... but when some of the slower numbers come along like 'Rhyme and Reason', I just don't get it.. it doesn't sound good to me.. I mean, I listen to a lot of music and I can't understand how people get into this song... Dave's suicidal ranting and raving... his voice sounds like a wild beast... I'm not going to lie, this is just terrible material... 
 The idea for this book is an excellent one, but the results are very disappointing. Each participant makes such a weak case for their respective positions that the debate itself becomes superfluous. It's like watching the 3rd card in a boxing match. Who cares? For example, Gary Habermas tries to make the affirmative case by citing what he calls 12 "known historical facts" that are indisputable. Here are some of his known facts along with the disputations he apparently was unaware of...  p. 19 "Jesus died due to the rigors of crucifixion" - Very many scholars doubt that the 3 to 6 hours that Jesus was on the cross were sufficient to be a cause of death. Many people lasted for 3 or 4 days. Even Pilot himself was surprised to learn that Jesus died so quickly. Indeed, there are many scholars who believe that the resurrection was actually a "resusitation". This may or may not be true, but it is NOT true that Jesus' death by crucifixion is an uncontested historical fact.  p. 19 "...was buried." The question as to whether or not Jesus was placed in a tomb or simply thrown into a ditch and later buried in a pauper's grave is a debated topic. See, for example, Martin Hengel's informative book Crucifixion in the Ancient World and Haim Cohn's excellent book The Trial and Death of Jesus. Regardless of your belief, it is incorrect to claim Jesus' placement in the tomb as uncontested historical fact. It is not fact at all. Finding Jesus' body in the tomb would establish the fact that he had been placed there. Reading about the placement in the Gospels does not make it fact!  p. 20. "James, the brother of Jesus and a skeptic, was converted to the faith when he also believed he saw the resurrected Jesus." - Nonsense. There is nothing in the New Testament about James' conversion. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence that the Gospels were edited to remove evidence of the positive involvement of Jesus' family (see Butz' excellent book - The Brother of Jesus - for details). In any event, most scholars believe that John 7:5 was a later insertion, and it is John 7:5 which is the basis for Habermas's bold and encompassing assertion. James skepticism and conversion are not uncontested facts.  I could go on, but you get the point. If the debater's case is weak, the debate is weak.   The need for an informed debate on the resurrection is still there. This promising book does not meet that need. 
 This is the kind of book that makes my blood boil.   1. If bikers are so intent on expressing their individuality, why do they ride around in a herd at thity miles-per-hour wearing identical "baaad" outfits?  2. Loud pipes don't save lives, they create even more anti-motorcycling sentiment with the general public. Loud pipes will LOSE bikers' rights.  3. Nam is over, dudes. Have a little self-respect and stop peddling your trauma. Grow up.  4. What the hell is that typeface all about? Oh, I remember... individuality, again. Right.  I'm a motorcyclist. Not a biker. I ride alone, and I like it; I like the skill, the grace and the challenge. I'm well aware that I could be killed or maimed at any given time while riding. But that doesn't qualify me to write this kind of pseudo-philosophical claptrap.  Save your money. Buy a copy of... ANYTHING else 
 I'm not a perpetual dieter or diet book enthusiast. I occasionally have a few pounds to lose and I do it by cutting back on food. But recently I've found it more difficult than usual to discipline myself so I looked for a diet book that might make it easier. I was impressed by the promises made by the 3-Hour Diet: eat anything...no counting calories...no exercise...lose 2 pounds every week just by timing your meals. Well, it ain't necessarily so. Eat anything? Yes, as long as each meal consists of the proper balance of carbs, protein, fat, and vegetables or fruit. And we're talking miniscule...not to mention undecipherable...amounts of each.  For the carbs--you want a Rubik's cube size portion. (Huh?)  Fats--make sure your portion size is equivalent to a water bottle cap! My favorite: you'll want to eat a portion of vegetables equivalent to 3 DVD cases. (I'm not kidding.)  No counting calories? That's just a flat-out lie since your meals are limited to 400 calories, snacks are limited to 100 calories. What's more, "meals" and "snacks" are alternated on this "eat every 3 hour" schedule, so you're going 6 hours between your 400 calorie meals. Stop hunger? Yeah, right.  No exercise? Well O.K. Yet exercise is recommended and there's a chapter devoted to suggested exercises. (Along with a suggestion that you get the author's exercise books!) But what bugged me the most about this book is the fact that the author is a Tony Robbins disciple and MOST of the book is devoted to "you can do it" motivation-speak. More than 100 solid pages are wasted with suggested "visualizations" and blank pages for the reader to record his/her day-by-day menus and thoughts.  Maybe "scam" is too strong a word but in no way does this book deliver what it promises.  
 I'm a huge fan of Amon Duul II but this album is pure garbage.This is not the classic Amon Duul II line up and this album has nothing worth listening to Don't buy anything from Amon Duul II if it was released after 1975 .If you want to listen to the real Amon Duul II buy Yeti,Live in London,Tanz Der Lemmings , Vive le Trance,Carnival of Babylon or Hijack.I'd like to give this CD a Zero but I can't 
 It was hard to believe that this novel was written by JAK.  The prologue was the best part of the book.  It started out with an explosion of character involvement and then the fire went out.  She failed to give the reader a true insight into the main characters.  I was hard pressed to understand why the two main characters were attracted to each other.  I could only assume it was because they were trying to save a small company.  There was no "electricity" between them.  She had numerous secondary characters that never stood on their own.  I read the entire book in one weekend, only because if I put the book down, I could not remember who was who.  I hope the real JAK comes back to us soon 
 It's time to retire this old book which is amazingly rigid in its decorating ideas and its school-marmish, rules-oriented approach to design. Decorating today is so personal, yet Martha (or this old book, anyway) seems to think that there is only one way to do things. It reminds me of a 1950s book filled with rules for the little housewife to follow, but it certainly doesn't fit the world of today's educated, style-conscious, and confident consumer. Bleah 
 I'd never heard of Mosley before I picked up (t)his book @ the library.  My first warning of the bias to come was that its dedicated to Danny Glover, who has taken the ultra-liberal stance of loons claiming America "deserved" 9/11.    I read eight of the nine stories; two were character-driven and excellent, the rest were passable.    Futureland takes place around 2030.  There is no privacy.  Citizens are monitored at all times, or can be as needed.  Corporations run the government; a software titan, quite mad, runs a great deal of the world from an island called Home (he's nothing like Bill Gates).  A permanent, official underclass of Unemployed--including those prevented from working if they disobey company rules--sits under New York. Offshore corporate prisons house inmates completely stripped of their citizenship.  Cloning is well out of its infancy with all the attendant promises and horrors to come.  A drug called Pulse, which creates ultra-real fantasies and illusions but is virtually guaranteed to kill its users by collapsing their brain tissues, is legal.  And the World's Greatest Boxer is a 6'9" coffee-skinned woman.    In this fascinating yet unlikely world Mosley weaves his tales.  Sometimes the prose is shaky, and I disliked the way the overt (and unlikely) racism is portrayed with a chip on the author's shoulder.  Mosley, who is black (and unsmiling in the jacket photo) seems to have it in for Whites, but compared to the Mosleyverse, the amount of real world power Whites wield, now and in the future, is shrinking along with the worldwide White population; by 2030 Whites will be a tiny minority (and globally, already are).  There's not a single Hispanic in the book, and they're the fastest-growing American minority!    I can't understand how an otherwise skilled author, easily capable of illustrating the monstrousness of gigantic and abusive governments, doesn't realize that free markets are what bring people out of poverty; nothing else.  Hope you eventually come out of the communist fog you're in, M Mosley.  Post-script:  I agree with the reviewers who suggest Futureland should've been a novel and not a collection of stories.  Word to your mother 
 The original Five Love Languages was insightful, had a variety of examples and provided a good amount of psychological and Christian theory and application.  This book is supposed to be for singles, but almost every example has to do with dating couples--people I don't really consider single.  Rarely does it talk about regular friendship--and when it does, it's guy-girl friendships.  I was hoping to get some insight into my same-sex friendships, family relationships and guy-girl non-romantic friendships, but this book falls horribly short of that.  Get the original copy and just use a little imagination and brain-power to apply it to your single life.  You'll save the time, money and frustration 
 This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
 Anybody that has spent anytime around boats would know 90% of the information covered in this book.  At least it is a quick read so not much time is wasted on it.  It would probably be helpful for someone who has never been on a boat but, has plans to move aboard in less than a week 
 after seeing The Guru on TV i got into the whole sex book thing i read all the best sellers from Mars and Venus in The Bedroom by John Gray to How To Get Any Girl Any Time by The Guru  these books changed my Life but in Particular this book was not so great because i and my fiance read it and found that it really was not too helpful and out dated  
 This is the sadest little book ever! After reading Will Clower's "Fat Fallacy", and becoming a big fan of "eating for pleasure", I wanted to find more books on the topic and came across the reviews for "The Martini Diet", in which one of the readers compared this book to Mr. Clower's- immediately stirring my interest. But unlike the "Fat Fallacy"- written in an intelligent, constantly providing scientific facts- sort of way, which convinced me to adopt the life style in the first place, Jennifer Sander's book is written on a middle/highschool level and I found it close to unbearable to read. If I haden't read the "Fat Fallacy" first, I'd have no idea what this woman was talking about and would assume that this was something she and her "big-big" friends (Her words, not mine!) came up with while sipping on Martini's.  If she's not constantly talking about "putting Martini glasses down" to engage in other activities(is she an alcoholic?), she contradicts and repeats herself over and over again: -Like stating that she enjoys the Slim Fast Shakes and breakfast bars, which substitue for a REAL breakfast. So much about a "real food diet"!  - On page 49 she even advertises calorie counting (and I thought that that was excactely what we didn't want to do anymore!) - And what about her statement, that "real grown ups" are never seen in public drinking anything, including bottled water because that would be tacky!? Hello?  Just to mention a few disturbing things.  I absolutely agree with the outline of this diet, but it couldn't have been advertised any worse than this! "Gin" Sanders seems to want to morphe herself so desperately into Jacky O. and Co., that you can't help but wonder what happened to this woman during her "heftier" day's, to make her completely want to become somebody else. If you are not interested in turning yourself into a "wannabe" socialite with a few simple tricks from "Gin", but would like a great- new approach to nutrition, explained with adult reasoning, then I suggest you read William Clower's "Fat Fallacy" instead!  This could have really been a great book... : 
 Reading this book is like watching a porn movie: all sex and no plotline.  Another thing I found unbelievable is that Helen took back her maiden name and became a "Miss" again. From what I know of the period, women loved to be a widow because that status granted them more freedom. Coulter could not come up with a good explanation why Helen would take back her maiden name after her first husband died 
 I was looking for a book to describe a structure, do's and don'ts, and general guidance for developing a business oriented mentoring relationship/program.  I found the book lacked any specificity to the business world as opposed to general living.  Worse, I found that by reading the first sentence of each paragraph, I got the idea, rather than spending time going into each repetitive example.  On the chance I was too negative about the text, I loaned it to an associate who is heavily involved with mentoring and he also found the book to be redundant with rather obvious recommendations.  Purchase another text if you are looking for a guide to mentoring in the business world 
 Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff. 
 i guess anyone can get published these days, even jackbooted morons like randall. hey the biggest perpetrators of racism in today's america are racist bigoted blacks like yourself randall. check yourself fool. love and peace is oh so neat, but randall's book smells like stinky ole feet. if you have any semblance of a brain and can think rationally, avoid this clown trying to leech off the black community with sucker-punch books like this one 
 One day, accountants and soldiers may take an interest in differential geometry. If and when such a day comes to pass, this book will have a role to play. Until then, engineers, physicists and mathematicians alike have better alternatives, such as the inspiring texts, with complementary qualities, by Burke, "Applied Differential Geometry"; by do Carmo, "Riemannian Geometry", or by Spivak, "A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry".  Even more advanced books such as Lang's or Petersen's are more readable: in them the extra formalism brings the reward of more powerful results. Here the retentive attention to the trees at the expense of the forest is merely a barrier to entry for the uninitiated. This text's popularity in some areas of engineering must have played a role in the slow acceptance of Riemannian geometric methods.  Manuel Tenid 
 I felt the book had highly unorganized content inside the chapters. The examples were vague and confused me further. It's more like a reference book than the text book which would explain the beginner Palm OS programmer the nuts and bolts of palm OS .I read the online docs for palm os4.0 sdk and found them much more informative than the book 
 The title says it all: one month the warranty expired, the zoom feature on the camera broke, making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on.  The camera is all but useless.  The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10.  
 Believe it or not there was red stuff inside!!!!!  Today I unscrew my "Brita Ultra Faucet Filter System". Well, I was shocked to discover that  inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing.   I called Brita and was told that it is not the product, SINCE IT IS NOT EVEN DESIGNED TO FILTER OUT BACTERIA, it must be the water. Long story short: Brita still pushes it product on people who doesn't know better.   This product is poorly designed and drains bad, therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it. Since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one.   IF you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out. Neither did I, you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo.  Stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality. 
 Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone 
 I cannot imagine, being Shannon Tweeds and Gene Simmons children and picking up this book one day with the thoughts of maybe getting to know a different more in depth side of your mother. Most Biographies involve birth to the present and everything in between. I knew Shannon Tweed as an 80's movie D-Lister. She was basically in every single sitcom or drama back then as a guest star, or walk on. Her face is sort of recognizable, you might say "I know her from somewhere" but you can't place her.  She is beautiful, she is married to a rock star, and she of course is now in her own reality television show just like everyone else. This book, all 200 pages, lots of pictures, and large type is kind of pathetic. Not in a way that she herself is, but cmon, if you are going to write a "this is my story", spout some details, spill your emotions, give us something besides how you noticed your future husband was very aroused the first time you met him, and how many names you can drop. There are pictures of this woman, taken from playboy, that are full on nude Furry parts and all, I would be mortified if I was her children. There is a time and place for everything; a biography isn't one of them to show your naughty places. Tacky. I read this book, in ½ an hour, and I am not lying. It was that simple. Shannon, your shacking up with Gene Simmons, and your book is basically devoted to your boobs. 
 After weeks of delaying my shipment I was told Amazon could not get the book for me .. 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 One of the commercial reviews indicates that this book is a "period piece" and that description probably best describes the book.  It was written in a period of time long before Rothko was working his signature style and had achieved any success.  It also didn't help that the Introduction, by the late painter's son, Christopher Rothko, was unnecessarily portentious.  The later parts concerning the history of the manuscripts, also written by Christopher Rothko, do tone down the excess language and are quite interesting.  The essays themselves seem incomplete, pedestrian in spots, and extremely dated.  As others have noted, Rothko doesn't talk about his own work.  Who is the audience of this book?  Completists?  Researchers?  It can't be that many people.    Something like the publicaton of Kurt Cobain's Journals in book form several years after his suicide had relevance to that artist, even if it was a bit like peeking into somebody's diary.  "The Artist's Reality" has almost no relevance to most fans of Mark Rothko and certainly none to those who appreciate his more famous style of painting 
 This book was so one sided and the author didn't even try to hide that fact. There was nothing about the the countrys history to say why the Serbs would think/know that that country was theres. Its would not be a good book for someone to read if they didn't know anything about Serbs 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 could have been okayed into production? how come these veteran actors would have signed up playing these ridiculous roles? why we have to view these kind of lousy movies churned regularly out of hollywood again and again? boring, boring and boring. i would rather watching rabbits sitting around and eating their grass all day long than watching this bore-to-death and brain-dead movie. give it a rest, will you, hollywood 
 To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job. I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life. 
 911 was an inside job. Our constitution, our civil liberities are being taken away. The FBI has even concluded that they don't have any proof that Bin Laden was behing the 911 attacks. Moreover, what confounds me with regard to this book is that half of the identies of the real hijackers have never been established. I hope and pray people wake up.  
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland.  It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, "summarizing" kind of a feel.  The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience.  Said again, he should have taken personal "ownership" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.  Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale.  Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.   I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more "valid" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it.  Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.  I recommend a different translation. 
 Flipping through the pages of Writer's Digest at a local bookstore, I found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting, especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer. So I decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that I realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine.   Since I have subscribed online directly through WD's website in Jan 2005, I have received only a few issues. In the first few months for almost half a year, I received no issues at all. It was only later then when I e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me. The annoying thing is that even though I have e-mailed WD a few times on this problem, they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription. How does this tackle the root of the problem? If they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service, they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers' option. Ironically, I received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter.  Logistic problems aside, the magazine does have its plus points. In the issues, there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing, but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well. Occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work, their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration. All this from a range of authors from a range of genres. Essentially, the business of writing is also not left out.  However, the magazine is not one fraught without problems. The problem with WD is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered. Each article though containing valuable tips on writing, does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented. In addition, because of its range, it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently, which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers. Sometimes, it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues. This for example, can be seen in the amount of publishers' addresses that they offer. At most, each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses. There is nothing wrong with this, but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a Writer's market collection of publishers(and agencies) addresses collected into one? And ironically again, the same company does publish a 'Writer's Market' collection which is of excellent quality annually.  That said, the same problem - the lack of information and depth, is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well. To make matters worse, every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times. Writers want to organise their time and information, not add on to it.   If you want are thinking of subscribing to WD, do consider the alternatives that are currently available. Writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think. However, if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life, than this magazine might be for you. But do your research first 
 I bought this because it was 50% off. I can't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer. I guess for background noise, it would be good but as a photo viewer, it's not. Small screen + low resolution = poor viewer 
 please, editors, tell the new writer that a given plot must be cohesive.  A friend of Qwill's is killed in an accident, a friend who is the significant other of a fellow whom Qwill has known since he, the fellow, was a youngster, and Qwill does----NOTHING!!???  Get out of town!  Also, why was that hunting accident/murder thrown in?  Where did it go?  Nowhere!  Get the new author, or authors, up to speed 
 MY HUSBAND WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WHEN RECEIVING HIS DVD AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONLY PLAYABLE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN. WHY WASN'T THAT MENTIONED WHEN PURCHASING IT 
 I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere 
 Lloyd's grandiose hypothesis/opinion/wishfull thinking is that "The universe is a quantum computer" For a hypothesis/opinion to become an accepted scientific theory/fact, it must be self-consistent, and it must make a good number of sharp predictions that separate it from competing theories, and, of course, all its predictions must agree with experimental observations.  lloyd does not bother to show that his hypothesis/opinion meets any of the conditions that would make it a scientific theory. For this reason, in my opinion, LLoyd's book is an opinion book dishonestly presented as a science book 
 I've read much better. In this book it is OK to rob a person of freedom if the people involved are airheads. The author is not funny in her attempts at humor 
 It read like all the other Wiccan books popping up everywhere. Same old stuff. Save your money 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 The denying of the Armenian Genocide is the ultimate final chapter of the history of that and any Genocides. What is happening in Iran today to "redefine", "rewrite", the Jewish Holocaust is the same act that the Turkish Government and its hired workers like Guenter Lewy, Heath Lowry and Justin MacCarthy are doing for a very long time now. While on the other hand, that same government persecutes any Turkish author or scholar who dares even TO UTTER the word "Ermeni Soykirimi" in Turkey.  If Lewy and literature gangsters like him are allowed to defame the memory of millions of the 1915 Armenian Genocide dead and the massacre medleys that came before it between 1984 and 1909, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence to show its truth and reality; why then one should not honor people like Fredrick Toeben, Robert Faurisson, Georges Thiel, David Duke, David Irving, who defame the sacred memory of millions of Jews and other minorities who perished in the death camps of Aushwitz, Treblinka and Sobibor? Then what in the hell is the difference when people die en-masse in those mentioned camps, and in the Turkish Geovernment planted camps of Deyr-Zor, Meskene, Raqqa, Haseke, Margadeh and other places between 1915-1918? Has Lewy and his denying gang seen any Armenian woman who was gang raped to death? Any Armenian priest being burned alive? Any Armenian child who was torn from her mother and her skull crushed in front of her? Those who were mass suffocated, hanged, shot, stabbed, and drowned? Have they been there..?  If one says that the Armenian Genocide is not.. Then one can dispute any Genocide... SHAME ON THEM ALL.  Even Turkish scholars like Akcam, Pamuk, Gocek, Shafak and many others, share that same feeling... 
 Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best: Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. ("My Name is Prince"? His take on "Nothing Compares 2 U" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness every records.  BOTTOM LINE: This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off with THE HITS/THE B-SIDES which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles) 
 I cannot understand how anyone could understand this book, let alone claim to love it. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the first book I ever hated so much to give up on it, and before I was even halfway through it too! Allegedly there's a plot in there somewhere, but because it is buried underneath constantly shifting narrative, dialogue so unclear you can't tell who's saying what to whom, the unclear point of view, the shattered grammar and tense and made-up vocabulary, the book is so screwy that I literally had NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. It was like reading a transcription of someone's fever delirium. If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would! This book is not a classic, it's a gross mistake 
 The only thing you can say about today's music is that it's disguisting, gross, and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool, until they get shot.  Every copy of this CD should be burned 
 I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.   "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.  The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)  Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote. 
 Our boys had a good time with this toy, but after a 5-6 launches it broke! Not just the wings but the plastic body.  I feel like it was a waste of money and over priced 
 After reading this I find it hard to believe the WTC steel was turned to dust. WTC "Dustified" by a beam weapon?  I ran the numbers to vaporize most of the steel in the WTC.  No one has created the energy source yet to be used in a controlled weapon, and there was no mention of what would power such a weapon.  Not any real evidence to support the claims.  
 I loved the book, really nothing new in it I felt from the last one, you got a new sticker, and a cd showing a shim, (a woman or man) talking to someone.  I didn't get my free screensaver and all that stuff that was suppose to be there, when I contacted the publisher, they told me to contact Amazon.  
 the case did fit the player very well and did excellent in protecting it, but... 1. you have to remove the player to charge because the charger isnt that small, leaving scratch marks on the zen 2. it is kinda bulky, cant fit in any pockets 3. must remove the zen if you want to use the microphone feature  i just bought the silicone case with screen protectors, works just as good, doesnt leave scratch marks, much much smalle 
 This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in 1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs.  Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge....The CD starts off well, with Hits from the Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals.  The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target... 
   I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the "How to Form an LLC" book (which I'm NOT going to do).    I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here.  What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).   The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm.  A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.  Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.  Awfully light for "All you need to know" 
 This is a really weak and uninspired translation - really a rewriting - of Brother Lawrence's classic little book.  The author/translator says that this is a "thought-for-thought" translation rather than a literal one, and admits that this is a risky proposition.  He's right that it's risky, especially when a writer is careless and takes unwarranted license with a text, and unfortunately he's failed in his attempt.  It could and should have been otherwise.  The author goes overboard trying to make the book sound contemporary, filling it with American colloquialisms and excessive informality to the point that it often sounds like a trivial conversation between teenagers ("let's bulldoze the dike that holds back God's flood," "let's cash in lost time," "if death is tailgating us, we need to be ready," "life offers no `do-overs'," don't look for the pleasure payoff," and on and on).  There are places where subject and verb don't agree and other grammatical or stylistic errors cause a lack of clarity.  When a writer allows himself great license, he can't blame problems like these on the original text.  The author has been a news reporter and advertising copywriter, and it shows.  This is too important a book to be treated with this much sloppiness and irreverence.  I'm surprised at NavPress for letting this one slip through, and I strongly suggest that you buy a better version (the Whitaker House version, for example, is better and cheaper) 
 Chose this guidebook over others as much to check out the Frommer's style as to get travel info. Normally I am a Lonely Planet guy, but since I was staying with friends didn't need a lot of in depth descriptions of logistics (lodging, travel etc.). Just looking for a description of some of the attractions.  I found the guide difficult to use. Although I didn't need much in the way of logistical support, there was really very little. There were only about 4 maps in the whole book and they were spaced out all over the place. Virtually no information on specifics for those arriving overland. Worse, the descriptions of the attractions any sense of enthusiasm. Normally when I read a guidebook, I get the sense that sites are over-hyped, but this book almost made me want to skip the city altogether.   I have found Frommers on-line a good source of info and reviews but won't be buying another of their guidebooks in the future 
 If Paul and Ringo decided to record an album together and called themselves "The Beatles," would everyone think that was cool? Of course not. Big Star was a quartet, ultimately reduced to two by the time this uneven and often gloomy collection of songs was recorded. Chris Bell defined the sound of, and essentially produced, the excellent debut album "#1 Record." If you want to know how much the Big Star sound had already been crystallized before "LX" Chilton got involved, listen to the three eventual Big Star tracks on the album by Bell's previous band "Rock City," now commercially available on CD. Fast forwarding back to Big Star, Bell was involved in the first demo session for "Radio City" and wrote a good chunk of "Back Of A Car" before departing the band. Yes, Chilton deserves credit for carrying on and writing great songs like "September Gurls," for the second album, but by the time his sometimes-cowriter Andy Hummel had also departed, the band had essentially ended. Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens admitted as much when they called themselves "Sister Lovers" on the session sheets for the album later mislabled as "Big Star's Third." Stephens, as noted by other reviewers, actually writes and sings one of the better songs on the album, "For You." Alex has his moments here and there, but seems to have lost his spark for writing and recording what we would now refer to as "power pop." And despite his eventual cult status, has never really regained it in any sustained way. Personally, I prefer Bell's "I Am The Cosmos," but if you're going to pick up "Third," get the Bell CD as well, and decide for yourself who still had the chops 
 To be honest, the most useful piece of information in the book, and the most telling comment regarding the author's attitude, is on the back cover, where he references the "unforgivably successful" book by Bernard Goldberg that inspired this tome. That's the liberal mindset after all: ANY success is unforgivable. After reading the back, I put the book back on the shelf and bought Goldberg's book 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 This text provides a simple, elementary introduction to the subject of TP therapy, but falls far short of providing a truly useful guide for massage therapists wanting to become skilled in effectively applying these techniques on their clients. This is a large book with very little important information about the nature of TPs pathologies, comprised mostly of body mappings of probable TP locations within muscle groups that are grossly generalized and of little real use in TP palpation. The Davies wookbook is not an expensive guide for understanding the basic concepts, but the serious bodyworker will find little meat to the material before soon needing a much more in-depth guide to go further 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 It starts off with a great premise for a novel - who wouldn't be drawn to the emotional and psychological complexities of a family torn apart by the loss of a child? But it's soon apparent that the book will be a letdown. First of all, the main character, Beth (mother of the lost child), is wholly unlikeable. Of course, there's no rule that says that main characters have to be lovable, but after several dozens of pages that deal with this woman wallowing in self-pity and shamefully neglecting her two surviving children, this reader started wondering whether losing them as well wouldn't be in the kids' best interests. She is not only disagreeable - which is OK - but boring as well. The melodramatic general tone of the novel is also a big no-go - the word cheesy doesn't begin to describe it.   Apart from the annoyingly one-dimensional characters, I found another big flaw in the several mistakes in the book, to which other reviewers have referred (Kerry's age, for example) and the numerous typos. These detracted from the book's credibility, as did the contrived and artificial denouement of the story.  Lastly, none of the other reviewers seems to have noticed three details I found completely unpleasant. One is the Italian grandfather Angelo's disparaging comments about the Japanese. These comments, put in the mouth of a clearly sympathetic and likeable character, seem strangely out of place, and yet, they don't seem intended to portray flaws in that person - they seem to be just what the author thinks it appropriate for that man to say. I thought it disgusting, as I did restaurant-owner Augie's comment that "if people want to starve, they can go to Ethiopia, they don't need to come to my restaurant". What's that supposed to mean? Isn't it a really gruesome, unfeeling, nasty-rich-American comment? Can anyone explain in what way these gratuitous, unsensitive phrases help the plot of the novel?  In the same vein, I was also angered by lesbian Candy's comment regarding her wish to be a mother: "There's probably a lovely little girl out there in Chile waiting for me" (not a literal quote). Why a little girl in Chile? If I were Chilean, I'd be offended - I'd like to know why Miss Mitchard thinks a Chilean kid would be better off in the hands of an American single woman who married a man against her sexual inclination and for the sole purpose of becoming pregnant (and left him when she didn't) than they would be with their natural families, however poor or needy. I also wonder whether Miss Mitchard has ever considered the fact that there are probably as many abandoned and destitute children in the USA as there are in Chile, if not more.  Maybe these unacceptable comments would have been less noticeable in a book that was more engaging and better written; as it is, they stood out like pins in a cushion, and made me dislike the novel even more 
 I think that people who buy this book should know that many of the recipes require the use of a cake mix.  It may be that when I actually make the cakes, I will regret what I write now, but until then I am feeling a little short changed.  Surely Mrs. Pregnall does not use commercial cake mix in her own shop 
 This entire novel is an excuse to complain about how hard it is to be a women. Her writing is weak and does not capture your interest.  This novel should not be called a classic 
 I just took the test. I read this book and Sybex by Michael Pastore and failed the test horribly 620-900. Don't waste your time with these books. The test is designed to go in depth about the general concepts. In which you won't find in these books.And there alot of mistakes, and not enough information in both of these books.  
 I have over 4,000 lps and 5,000 CDs in my collection. Believe me, nobody would ever accuse me of being overtly mainstream. But, as much as I have tried to embrace this band (I tend to trust my peers when they vehemently reccomend something), I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to play this. Maybe I need to see them live. For you fans, I don't want to damper your enthusiasm -- it's marvelous to truly love a band and it's music. But, for perhaps the first time ever, I simply can't figure out why this is more special, or even remotely as good, as a lot of other releases were in that year. Sorry. Maybe a listenable singer would help, I dunno. I know Coyne's a supposed "genius" and all, but.. 
 This book is several years old now, but even when it was fresh off the press it was useless. All it contains is disorganized reams of documentation that you can get off the web on the subject. No examples. No organization. I suggest you buy "Quicktime for Java: A Developer's Notebook". Some people think this book is too brief, but I found it to answer all of my questions. To fill in any gaps, you might consider also getting the definitive guide to Quicktime programming, "Quicktime Toolkit", volumes one and two, by Tim Monroe. That is more for programmers using the C language, but between the Developer's notebook and the two volume set you should be able to figure out just about anything you desire in Quicktime, including how to port what you're interested in to Java 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 It's rather amazing how many five star "reviewers" have so much of the same bad information to impart about John Kerry, but so little to say about the substance of this book.   Rather than recycle chatroom effluvia, I will actually review the book:   Poorly researched, poorly written. Nasty, vindictive, and dishonest from start to finish.   For example, in describing his 1971 debate with Kerry on the Dick Cavett show, John O'Neill not only misrepresents what Kerry and Cavett said, and the audience's response, he actually misquotes HIMSELF. As the transcript (and video) of the debate is posted at O'Neill's own website, how hard would it have been to check for basic accuracy?   And why tell such easily proven lies, like claiming Kerry was booed during the debate, when the video clearly shows that he wasn't?   If you watch, you will also see O'Neill repeat a stunning lie about his own military service - his claim to have served "almost three years" in Vietnam. He made this claim several times in 1971, both in speeches and in writing. But his records show that he served no more than a total of 15 MONTHS in Vietnam, and that included his time offshore on a minesweeper. (You can see his military records yourself, linked through his profile at Wikipedia.)   More examples of lies and misrepresentations in the book? How about the part where O'Neill claims that Kerry filmed interviews of himself while in Vietnam - four years before those cameras had sound capability.   In a more egregious example, O'Neill posits, in Chapter 5 of UFC, that George Elliott wrote a Silver Star citation that did not reflect what happened that day. He is not honest enough to use the actual citation written by Elliott, but instead uses a later, edited version and then quotes things - like "numerically superior force" - that Elliott NEVER WROTE. The original citation written by Elliott PRECISELY reflects what happened that day - things he claims he was never told - as do the after action report and Zumwalt's monthly summary. (All of which can be found at SBVT's own archives.)   In this connection, O'Neill claims that Elliott had no idea there were troops on the boats that day (even though he was division commander) and that they conducted the first sweep - although Elliott's citation, the after action report, and the monthly summary SPECIFICALLY state that there were troops on the boats and that the troops conducted the first sweep. He also claims that "[t]here is no indication that Kerry ever reported that the Viet Cong was wounded and fleeing when dispatched" - but Elliott 's citation and the after action report SPECIFICALLY state that Kerry shot a fleeing VC, and the after action report says that the man was wounded.   In addition, O'Neill claims that Hoffmann and Elliott had been told Kerry had "almost single-handedly" taken out a bunker of VC - except NOTHING OF THE SORT appears in the original citation, the after action report, the monthly summary, or the news release for the incident. In fact, the after action report specifically says that "other units saturated [the] area with fire and beached placing assault parties ashore" while Kerry chased the VC. And of course Elliott made it quite clear in William Rood's Bronze Star citation that he didn't think anyone did anything "almost single-handedly" that day.   Again, O'Neill writes with regard to the first action, that "most, if not all, of the non-PCF troops received no medals for this action." (No kidding, he actually writes like that.) C'mon John, it is public information that the only American "non-PCF troops" there that day were the three Army advisors and the three UDT guys -  and all were awarded medals, including two Bronze Stars for the Army advisors.   And consider this. O'Neill sneers that Kerry deserved no more than a commendation medal for his actions that day. That means that none of the half dozen or so Navy officers and crew who earned Bronze Stars - for doing no more than Kerry did - deserved their medals either. No wonder William Rood wrote in disgust, "[T]his is hurting crewmen who are not public figures and who deserved to be honored for what they did. ... While they mean to hurt Kerry, what they're saying impugns others who are not in the public eye."   By the way, despite O'Neill's repeated claims to Ted Koppel and others, the eyewitnesses to the second sweep - including the only member of SBVT who was actually there - have consistently stated that there was substantial enemy fire from multiple VC at the scene. Just look inside those books you were waving at the camera, John. Or better yet, ask SBVT member Larry Clayton Lee, who believes that Kerry earned his medal that day, and whose eyewitness account contradicts just about everything you've said on the matter.   In fact, there is not a single person who was there that day who disputes what happened, or Kerry's medal. Again, as William Rood writes, "It's gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there."   And contrary to O'Neill's claim that the Silver Star was awarded after only two days, "with no review," the record shows it was awarded after six days, and in 1996 Elliott and Lonsdale themselves insisted that all proper review procedures were followed (as did the Navy inspector general, in 2004).   Not such great research, Johnny boy.   Though maybe we should blame some of this on Jerry Corsi. When Corsi's bigotry was revealed in some of his freeper postings, O'Neill promptly claimed that Corsi was not really the coauthor, but that he acted "simply as an editor." Now that's interesting, because aside from the fact that the narrative voice sometimes bounces between first person and third person in the same sentence, and that Corsi continues to brag about coauthoring the book, good parts of Chapters 6 through 9 (at least) are virtually lifted from his screeds at anti-Kerry sites.   Just a little short in the truth department, are we John?   While we're at it, let's ask Mr. Corsi why he REMOVED the picture of Robert McNamara's 1995 meeting with Gen. Giap, which hangs near Kerry's picture in the War Remnants Museum, from his webpage "documenting" the existence of the Kerry picture.   You see, John and Jerry show their readers pictures of other walls in the room from every possible angle (and even throw in a picture of Jane Fonda from a building across town), but conveniently "forget" to show you the most important wall of all...the wall upon which Kerry's picture is displayed. Hmmm, is it because Kerry's picture was displayed along with those of other visiting dignitaries such as McNamara, Warren Christopher, and yes, even ELMO ZUMWALT? New York Sun reporter Josh Gerstein says so ... run a browser search for his August 2004 article exposing this particular bit of sleaze.   Of course it is well known how many other claims in this book have been thoroughly debunked by overwhelming eyewitness testimony, Navy investigators, Navy documents, and in fact some of the accusers' own documents. (Tom Wright didn't patrol with Kerry after he "complained" about him? Not true, according to the command history. George Bates is "haunted" by the slaughter of village livestock? His own crewman claims responsibility for that.  William Franke's "recollections" of Kerry?  He wasn't there at the time. And O'Neill might want to get someone a little more competent to analyze those designator numbers on the March 13 spot report.)   For more point by point rebuttals of the lies contained in this book, go to Eric Rasmussen's most excellent online review, "Truth and Unfit for Command."   John O'Neill has repeatedly lied about his own service in Vietnam. In addition, he has been threatened with court sanctions for his venomous personal style, and passed over for a judgeship. Coming from the man who seconded Richard Nixon's nomination at the '72 convention, why is none of this surprising 
 While I enjoyed "Unto the Sons", and may read Talese's other works, I only thought so-so of this endless tome on the sex industry in the USA. I like his style of writing non-fiction in an engrossing manner, like reading a novel. His section on Noyes and the Oneidan community was wonderful. Then there is Hugh Hefner, who has sexual relationships with countless women, but was hot and bothered when his wife had an affair. And Talese's nine-year commitment to the work is highly commendable. But the scope of such a work needed more/wider coverage. The selection of scenes were few, and overdone. Not much on Masters & Johnson, or Sheryl Hite (sp.?) or Alfred Kinsey. The material on judicial matters, while important was tedious. Sandstone Retreat was saturated with coverage as well. After "Unto the Sons", a wonderful work on Italo-Catholics, who, like me, have roots in southern Italy, this was a let down. Catholicism becomes a punching bag in this work. He might have set up a thesis - antithesis dialogue about the understanding behind Pope Paul VI's "Humanae Vitae", but didn't do that either. In the end he speaks of his italian Catholic background as a means to help him live in a licenteous, heathenistic manner, one that nearly rips his marriage apart. Very strange. 
 More theory than action.  No real benefit to my junior agents or experienced agents 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 This was arguably the longest 2 hours I have spent in my entire life ... it felt like much more ... I found myself more than a little angry with the overkill leadup to what could have been a compelling story.  The punch line took way too long to get to ... and when it came, it just wasn't enough to convince me it was worth the wait.  With each pregnant pause between dialogue (and guitar strings), I was sure I'd be getting up to leave ... I suspect the invested time (hours and hours it seemed) precluded me from doing so.  I wanted that punch line ... then, finally, it came ... and it went.    This one had a ton of potential but it just didn't work for me 
 One day it just stopped working. I got the dreaded "orange and green flashing lights of death"... the contents of the File space were un-recoverable... and I ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it.  Apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that Apple likes to keep hush-hush 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 This book makes people want to quit undergraduate chemical engineering at my school.  I'd rather do slave work in a mineshaft than to try to read this dry and abstruse book again!  What a waste of people's lives when professors force their students to try to learn from this book. The subject matter itself should be challenging part and not the presentation.  You know, I think when authors spent too many years using the concepts, they feel like what is obvious to them is good enough for any novice to understand.  I felt like I had to translate heiroglyphics and learn fluid dynamics at the same time.  Of course, I don't mean to be so depressing and leave anyone hanging.  A good book like Fundamentals of Heat&Mass Transfer should be like a day at disneyland compared to this book.  Schaum's outlines can be quite nice too. Good luck 
 My son ONLY asked for this for Christmas, so I had to get it.  It doesn't do much -- he was bored with it within a few days.  It shoots the harmless "bullets" pretty far, but not easily aimed.  The pincher on our first one didn't work so we had to send it back for a replacement.  Pincher STILL isn't very strong & basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't "lift" objects, just grabs them & drags them around--and you have to hold a button continuously to hold the object.    And LOUD -- VERY LOUD -- the legs hit the floor VERY hard (though I haven't noticed any scratches on the floor).  We have a small house & you can hear the bug from one end to the other.  I would NOT buy this again. There are MUCH more interactive RC toys out there 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 There is almost no science to back up the author's claims about the benefits of companion plants. Most of her book is based on folk tales, myths and assumptions.   A gentleman named Craig Dremann actually studied the effects of companion plants and concluded that carrots detest tomatoes. Carrots do grow well with garlic and radishes but they grow very poorly with tomatoes. Carrots only grew to 6% of normal when interplanted with tomatoes. Tomatoes grew better with carrots so clearly the tomatoes were robbing nutrients from the carrots. Tomatoes also grow better with garlic but the garlic suffers, only growing 35% of normal.  The Craig Dremann booklet with his findings is called "Companion Plants: Carrots Really Detest Tomaotes" and is available from Redwood City Seed Company in Redwood City, CA 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 While this book does cover several main grammar points, it is difficult to use and poorly designed.  First of all, rather than offer the beginning student examples of useful conversations it offers lectures.  So instead of learning how to have a conversation we start out learning about Maha and that her father works at the U.N.  ANY beginning language book should be based on daily conversation types of dialogue.  Secondly, the type is rather 'fuzzy' and important short vowel and pronunciation symbols (written above and below the main script) are often either left off or completely illegible.  While it is true that in advance Arabic these symbols are often not shown, for a beginner they are very important.  Another poor design charastic of the book is that the table of contents is listed almost exclusively in Arabic so if a beginner needs to make a quick reference to something they can spend hours trying to find where it is located in the book.  The accompanying DVDs are a great idea but not very well done.  The language is given too quickly - more at the rate of an intermediate or advanced level - and there is no accompanying written dialogue to help the student figure out what is being said.  The Vocabulary on the DVD often times has a huge, long sentence to show how to use a single, small word. BEginners learn more easily and much more quickly when they are given small, bite size bits that they can easily digest and use in everyday conversations. (I created my own work around to this by having native Arabic speakers record the vocabulary words for me on an MP3 player)  While the grammar concepts tend to be well explained, there are not enough exercises to practice the concepts after the explanation.  A really great idea would have been to have lots of exercises WITH answers so that the student could immediately check their work and see if they are on the right track or not.  Instead the student has to buy the answer key... and the answer key is very difficult to read!  Also, the end of each chapter should have a brief synopsis of all grammar points gone over in the chapter so if the student wants a quick glance to refresh their memory, they aren't leafing through countless pages of fuzzy, black and white print.  This book seems to be the standard at the moment for a lot of colleges and universities offering Arabic language courses and I'm not sure why it is.  In a day of Adobe Illustrator and other text languages it would be fairly easy to create a nice text with color type to highlight important points and other key grammar issues.  In summary:  Lacks practical conversation practice. Has very poor type quality Offers no way for students to check their work Poor table of contents DVD soundfiles too much for beginner students.  On the plus side, it does explain grammar points well.  
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 I did a little calculating and I figure that if they sell all 20,000 (LIMITED EDITION??) of these for $40,000 each, they make $800 million.  But, the free shipping is killing them. IF they only charged $10,000 shipping, they could make a billion dollars on this book 
 This review concerns the original 1937 edition as well as the edited revised 1972 edition.  Nancy, Bess, George and Mr. Drew are staying at Deer Mountain Hotel/Lodge because Mr. Drew is working on a case concerning jewel thieves.  He asks Nancy's help to look for a woman suspected of being a member of the gang and who is supposed to be in the vicinity of the hotel.  The only clue to her identity is that she carries an expensive jewel case with the picture of a child in it (really now, like people are going to notice her jewel case and that it has a child's picture, but not be able to give even the slightest bit of a physical description of the woman, like her hair color????).  Nancy also hears a story about a haunted bridge in the woods near the hotel and she enters a golf tournament.  Zzzzzzzzz.  This has to be one of the most inappropriately titled books in the series.  There is a "haunted" bridge, but Nancy discovers the truth behind it on page 42 (in the original edition)!  The book isn't 1/4 over at that point.  What does the bridge really have to do with the rest of the mystery?  The whole golf tournament part is rather boring and unsuspenseful.  I'm not giving away some big secret by telling you that Nancy wins.  Nancy always wins or is the best at everything she does.  Frankly, I find it rather annoying. Just once I'd like to see Nancy be just alright at doing something or have Bess or George be better than her at something.  The book isn't a complete waste of time, the mystery concerning the jewel thieves isn't that bad and kept me somewhat interested.  This wasn't one of my favorites, but it was worth reading; although, anyone who reads it expecting a story about ghosts is going to be let down 
 Enough sai 
 Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists.  DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions.  DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.  DeLong's politics overcome his analysis.  This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions.  (...)  His political agenda overwhelm his rational 
 LIBERAL Business Ethics...  What an oxymoron, if liberals ran businesses it'll soon turn to Socialist and collapse.  No wonder our economy isn't doing too well, they're run by Leftist rebels.  This book just highjacks the teachings of basic philosophy ethics 101.  I wouldn't recommend this book.  I would recommend something else if it does exist.  Then again these college books are propaganda machines that destroy the minds of intelligent students (especially foreign students) who later take on top positions in their countries that further fuel anti-Americanism, thus creating more problems in the world 
 This book is as seriously over-rated as is the rest of Minasi's all-too-numerous titles. You would be far better off spending your time and money on "Running Linux, 4th Edition" or "Linux In A Nutshell", both printed by O'Reilly. Minasi writes as if he were being paid by the word and consequently you have to wade through reams and reams of useless verbiage and endless prattling. There are better books out there and at this point, Minasi is coasting on his reputation and doing the reader as serious disservice 
 I so looked forward to this book! Sounded great, reading all those memories,experiences and  and recollections of "golden era" horror films.  I counted exactly one memory, in the forward. This is NOT a book about memories. It's more reference book than nostalgia. It's a  book of one to two page synposis with partial cast and crew listings for several dozen horror movies. Sort of an expanded TV guide listing. But the real monster here is the misleading title. I will attempt to get my money back, because I believe the title is ethically on very shaky ground 
 The ESV is a generally a decent translation. However, when it comes to the physical product, it falls to the bottom of the heap. Perhaps it can take a lesson in the printing and binding area from all its "rivals".    Crossway claims to seek a decent pricing strategy but is it when you survey the entire field... it is another story.  This is not an isolated incident because I had purchased 4 variants of its offerings -   the premium leather, the hardcover pew edition, its bonded leather and  its Classic Thinline Editions  Each one of them far short of the competition in the generalized categories in binding, print quality and paper quality.  On a side note, I have not physically handled the ones printed over in the UK by HarperCollins noting from the scanned samples I received from a couple of friends, they are using the same printing plates for the EU market.   HarperCollins (which owns Zondervan) perhaps may deliver differently in the paper and binding quality but then, this is a let down for the folks out here in the US unless we pursue the Anglicized version of the ESV with a higher imported price.   Because of this, I rank it 2 stars for its dismal print/paper/binding quality. (Harsh but honest observation - It reminded me of the special edition low priced textbook program by the large publishing houses to help low income folks (Indian Edition is one such example). This is not a disparaging comment on the low price book program - that program is is a wonderful effort by some nicer publishing houses to help the needy students in the realm of education! 
 I cannot rate this item because it came DEFECTIVE.  I have not been able to view it.  VERY disappointed by this transaction.  I plan to send this item back 
 I'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored.  I am no fan of Bill O'Reilly and this novel is not the greatest, but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions...especially if, from the looks of some of these reviews, a reviewer have not actually read this book.  We need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits.    RE: a previous reviewer's statement that "under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko [...]".  The character in question was a villain who briefly appeared -- a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a 15-year-old when the hero/vice cop apprehended him.  In fact, O'Reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story: "Obviously, he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene."    That's the main problem with the novel.  He doesn't understand how a story is told, and it doesn't appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes.  He interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses: "Homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty".  You get the picture.  The details are not horribly original, but nothing is stolen outright that I can pinpoint.  And some scenes and subplots were actually funny.  I have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice.     There is nothing gratuitous, [...], or intentionally [...] in this book.  It is just mediocre -- but I did stick with it to the very end.  If you like media-related mysteries or O'Reilly, check it out of the library like I did.  Fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time.     
 When things do not go according to its instructions it can leave you with nowhere else to go, as when I connected the FireWire, according to its instructions, and the 'continue' button remained grey leaving me at a loss.  Still, as I said, very useful. 
 The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 Everyone knows Eminem. We know what he's like, we all know about his marital problems with Kim and his other problems with his mother and we know of his evident love for his daughter Hailey. Personally, I've heard enough about all of them, but Marshall Mathers thought there was more to say. This album was a serious mistake on his part simply because the SATIRE of his previous work has simply been boiled down to PARODY. Take Just Lose It for example. Eminem has a string of successes for his albums' first singles. Take the now legendary My Name Is. It was insightful to pop culture hypocrisy and still gave insight to his life. I loved his first album. Every song on it was brilliant. Now I feel robbed. Just Lose It is a shameful stab at Michael Jackson and homosexuality. He has aslo adopted a new way of rapping and "singing". It is nasal and it pisses me off. His song Puke is an immature low blow to Kim. If you hate her so much why don't you pretend she doesn't exist? Mockingbird does not have the same quality and sensitivity of Hailey's Song. Rainman is the only song I listen to on this album. It in itself deserves about three stars out of five. Some of the beats are catchy, some of his words are still funny. But if you have to get his albums, buy The Slim Shady LP or The Marshall Mathers LP 
 I thought I was getting a paper back text also, I wrote to the seller twice and they said the text is in the cd rom, this means my son has to carry his lap top to school all the time, I would have never bought it, if I did more homework, next semester this Amazon stuff is not worth it, I am just going to pay extra from the book store at College so I know what I am getting!!! 
 Lured by the attractive price and high storage I decided to step outside the world of CF cards and try the microdrive. As a professional photographer who shoots primarily studio work I disregarded how fragile these cards are whispered to be, after all I'm not even walking around with my camera right?   After the second week I noticed a CF ERR pop on my Canon. Hmm, probably just an oddity. Two weeks later a longer CF ERR, had to pop the card out and back in - I lost about eight shots.  Well, today it's dead. I don't mean not fast (which it never was), I don't mean buggy (which it always was), I mean dead. D-E-A-D.  Of course Amazon won't take it back because I just passed my 30 days! Yay.  What a waste. I will never buy another Seagate product again 
 I seriously wondered if I could take this book back the the bookstore it was so lame.  I have read many books that aren't so great, but this one was embarrassingly bad.  I couldn't get the image of Hannah wearing a party dress with an appliqued Christmas sweater AND mooseskin boots out of my head.  Stacy and Clinton from "What Not to Wear" would have been better at this party than the whodunit. And whoever heard of telling half the town about the murder before letting the woman's husband even know?  My old Trixie Belden mysteries I read 25 years ago were much more believable than this.  Also, I thought there would be a few recipes in the book, not over half the pages. Big letdown. 
 A very opinionated book. the author uses jung psychology exclusively. No other views or extrapolations are used.  Tunnel vision and too stringent for the 21th century.  Usually when a book is written on  a well writtten subjest matter---fatherless sons--their are other view points and outcomes that can be discussed. The cover is misleading "The Search for Masculine identity", where does it suggest gender changes or  subconscious desires.  All in all, it was a negative read-depicting fatherless sons, all fatherless sons to be doomed for many years with problems (at the end of the book he touches upon additional dark issues .There are positive outcomes , not that homosexuality is bad,  why not talk about the strengths and positive parenting of the fatherless sons. It could have been touched upon. The theory is stagnant viod or modern thought, and multilinear thinking.  Too much of one trained thinking is not good and no credit to the author. Furthermore,

 While this book would be useful as a reference, it is difficult to read straight through.  This however is not the real problem.  The real issue is that the book applies to the retired exam (9E0-569), not the current exam (9E0-402).  Unfortunately, this little parcel of information is not written on the cover, but instead on one of the introductory pages, making it impossible to know this when you are ordering the book online.  The worst thing is that this book was actually published after the exam it covers was retired.  Why Cisco would release a book on 01/15/2002 when the exam it pertains to was retired more than 2 months earlier is beyond me.  As you might guess, I am not particularly pleased to have discovered all of this after I had already purchased the book 
 The usb and power cords come out very easily which ends up being dangerous for the hard drive file system. The power cord kind of sags in the socket.  
 I bought this book, because I am very excited and eager to learn about ActionSctipting in Flash MX 2004. As others have noted, all of the references and examples in this book are based upon the interface of Flash MX. Aside from that very bad, misleading point -- this book has ZERO personality. The pages drudge on and on with points that have no supporting explanation or examples. I have busted out into out-loud laughter at how poorly this book is written. If this book had a voice, it would be the voice of Ben Stein as the teacher in Faris Beuler's Day Off. Avoid this book like the plague. There are several other books out there that are much more helpful. (incidentally, this is the FIRST time I've ever panned a book on Amazon... I feel such incredible obligation, that I'm taking the time to do it now. 
 Despite the fact that this movie is fairly entertaining and far better than previous attempts to capture King Solomon's Mines on film, it lacks the sense of atmosphere, drama and period of the original book.  In fact, it is so different from the book, that had the names been changed, no one would have recognized that it was adapted from Haggard's novel.       Instead of an engaging adventure story of (bachelor) gentlemen  treasure seekers in Africa, a lost tribe, evil tribesmen, a little magic, narrow escapes and lots of suspense, we get a sappy story of a young woman looking for her father who has been disappeared in Africa, and by the way, there might be a treasure.  She is, by the way, beautiful and blond, and her Great Lash Mascara never runs.     Hollywood has thrown in some evil Russians searching for the "Stone of the Ancestors" on a mission from the Russian Czar and has, of course, made Quartermain fall madly in love with the blond.  Gagool, the most evil of ancient women witch doctors (in the book) has been dumbed down to a gentle white faced and benevolent Geisha-like fairy godmother who saves the elderly father from death.  King Solomon's Mines are conveniently located in downtown Kukuanaland and the lovely Gagool hands over the key, and takes them to the door.      True to the genre, the moment they grab the stone of the ancestors the door comes down and they are trapped in the mine!  We are terrified by the suspense for at least 15 seconds, and then they find the way out, the walls come crashing down, they tumble to the ground laughing and decide to get married.  The End.  
 I'm an MBA student in a top5 business school in the US, and we use this as our textbook for the basic stats course. I've only read the first 5 chapters so far, and I've found this book to be one of the worst textbooks I've seen since college. Some very simple concepts are explained in very confused (and confusing) language, the text is very arid and skips over most of the conceptual subtleties or fallacies that the unsuspecting user of statistical data may easily fall victim to. I strongly suggest leafing through it before deciding whether to buy it (you can start with chapter 2, which is pretty typical of the tone of the book and, being the 1st "substantial" chapter of the book, doesn't assume knowledge of concepts defined in previous chapters). 
 I was distressed and disgusted with "Sometimes I Dream" being a rip-off of "E lucevan le stelle", from Tosca.  He's not the singer for me....and his cover of "Nights in White Satin" was very ho-hum. Justin Hayward should have stayed with the Moody Blues for that one 
 I was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books, especially five dysfunctions of a team, which is one of the most elegant frameworks i've seen on team dynamics.  lencioni's solution to silos and politics?  a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics.  it's a lot more complex than just that, and i'm surprised he didn't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership, which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem.  if you're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization, keep looking.. 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 Mr. Khekoyan, who reviews this disk below, is quite correct that it is errant in tempi and in percussive interpretation. I'm not in agreement with him about Glenn Gould's stature as the foremost interpreter of Bach of the century. I'd suggest listening to the performance of Menno van Delft, which is included in the Bach Edition complete works produced by Brilliant Classics. There are any number of people who might nominate Gustav Leonhardt, Trevor Pinnock, or Bob van Asperen as more insightful interpreters of Bach than Glenn Gould. Don't let Gould's curious cult status mislead you; his performances are more quirky than competent. Or, if you are attracted to the Art of Fugue rather than the Artist, you might listen to the performance of the Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet, also available on CD. Though there is no historical justification for playing Bach's harpsichord music on recorders, the LSQ makes fine and insightful music on their wooden flutes, large and small. At times they sound more organistic than Mr. Gould on his modern behemoth 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 There are parts of this book which are utterly engrossing.  Rosemont constructs a fine narrative of events.  Perhaps I should say "events", as it is at times researched like a eighth-grade paper.  Lots of conjecture, unsupported speculation, hearsay and other aspects of irresponsible scholarship.  Mr. Rosemont freely admits that there is frustratingly little concrete evidence about much of Hill's life, but he chooses to try and flesh out a lengthy book anyways.  This is exasperating at times as when one is forced to try and endure each and every tedious mentioning of the drawn or painted art of Joe Hill, despite the lack of much actual material (surviving anyways).  However, by doing this he touches on many peripheral aspects of Hill's life that have gone by and large unnoticed till now, but which are much easier to verify than the sketchy details about Hill himself.  Several mentions of correspondence, lives affected by Hill, and reactions to Hill's art, and many others tidbits of information are thrown out for more or less the first time in cohesive form.  Less cohesive, and downright teasing at times, are many starts and stops of several ideas that would be very interesting on their own.  The Wobbly influence on the beat poets, the slighting of the IWW by other revolutionary and pseudorevolutionary groups (rarely written about from a fellow worker's perspective), and others seem like promising beginnings for reading but then are waded into only ankle-deep.  At one point when abandoning a topic Mr. Rosemont even suggests that it would be a good idea for further research, by someone else.  All in all a fairly decent read but could have used prodigious editing and some fact-checking with standards higher than those of the NY Times 
 I am a huge fan of V.S. Naipaul. The premise of this book--exploring the effects of the colonial situation upon the lives of three men--is excellent. However, this book is a confusing conglomeration of three separate and unrelated stories, and there were times when I found myself wondering what was going on. I love Naipaul's flair for narrative and description, but the sections on Miranda are almost entirely dialogue, with lots of obscure references. I actually skipped over the last section on Miranda because I just could not get through it, whereas normally I am unable to put down Naipaul's books. Not one of his best works...in fact I don't recommend it to anyone aside from those hardcore fans who are determined to read everything this great novelist has ever written 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 This program is average to below average in it's abilities.  That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support. Why? because Roxio's  support bites!  You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help; whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop.   I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.  It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access.  Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive. Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.  NO MORE.  What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc. [EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].  Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc, [which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];  apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.  When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.  If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine. But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going. Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER.  That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls. Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.  IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.  If a company won't provide access to PATCHES,  even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches]  AND they  don't offer any type of  FTP site  as a download backup  option, then  I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.  I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies. [Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that].  When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.   Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.  
 Unless you live in Montana or are very familiar with the State, then this book will be of little use.  Get yourself a good guide book and a detailed map.  Montana is a beautiful state, but this book was not helpful on our recent trip.  And it's a very dull read, in my humble opinion.  Pass 
 SO....yeah...After Ashes I said I'd never buy another Tristania album, but; after reading the pre-reviews of "Illumination" being different, I thought "hey, why not?"  (If you liked "Ashes" no need to read further).  WOW....if you liked Morten Veland era Tristania do not buy this Album, if you read this review never having listened to Tristania, and you like goth metal with choirs, orhcestras, operatic voices, and superb beauty and beast vocals, etc I'd go with Morten's new band Sirenia, or the Tristania albums, "Widow's Weed," and "Beyond the Veil"   and coincidentally, Sirenia has a new one coming out in less than a month in the states.  Having heard some if it on myspace I'd say save your money for that one, especially if your a person with limited music budget.  It may not be fair to compare the band from the time of Morten to the present line-up, but the difference is massive, and in this listeners opinion, not for the better.  On "Illumination," Tristania sounds like a younger Lacuna Coil, which isn't bad....for Lacuna Coil.  There is very little use of Vibke's airy angelic operatic voice, and the choirs and orchestra are almost non existent.  As stated before, with one run-through of the album, it is very easy to compare them to a band sounding like Lacuna Coil, which is a huge jump (in my personal opinion) in the wrong direction from Widow's Weed and Veil.  If your looking for supreme goth/black metal look for Sirenia.  Nothing beats the lion roar of Morten.    If you liked "Ashes" then this album is up your alley, not much of a jump, although Vibke's vocal role is increased and the black metal voice is significantly less. The clean male voice and Vibke's voice harmonize...a lot...  Leading them to sound a lot like Lacuna Coil  If you liked Ashes, buy this, if your more of a fan of Morten Veland era Tristania, you will be disappointed...go with Sirenia's "Nine Destinies and a Downfall. 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 The problem with the Supreme Court is the same problem with virtually every U.S. institution, it is being coopted by corporate interests.  The watershed decision that started this process was the 1886 case of Santa Clara Country vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad, in which corporations were granted "personhood."  Since that time, the Fourteenth Amendment, among others, has been perverted by corporate lawyers to extend additional rights to Big Business, and we the people have been losing the legal structure to control these private tyrannies.  Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson warned of this growing menace when he said, "I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."  And President Grover Cleveland warned in 1888 that, "As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.  Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters." A much more interesting book on Constitutional matters is Thom Hartmann's "Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights."  Hartmann also hosts a daily radio program that inspires the most thought provoking dialogue in radio.  I can't say the same for Levin's book or his show. In fact, I think Levin is consciously avoiding the more profound issues that people like Hartmann raise.  These more pressing issues are also raised in the award-winning documentary "The Corporation" - which is available on Amazon in DVD format. 
 I returned this product to you as it was all in Spainish.  It wasn't asvertized as so.  All other purchases I've made from you get 5 Stars!  I'm a very satisfied customer 
 I would agree that this book (and the others like it by Hirsch) offer a basis for valuable information. However, I would warn you to supplement a literacy curriculum with other stories and authors that include cultures other than European American. Look closely at the contents and you will notice that his view of "American literate culture" is overwhelmingly European-American based. I agree that students need to learn "American literate culture," however, curriculum needs to represent the many people that make up our diverse nation.  5th Grade Teache 
 I got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38DDD chest.  Think again.  Go for the the ENELL sports bra.  I bought a size 3 and it is perfect.  No bounce whatsoever!!!  I was amazed.... don't bother with this one 
 Madona is the demonstration of all the things I've learned about the bell curve. When I studied Engineering I learned that accord to "bell curve" the majority of every population is composed of mediocre people. Romans used to say "Give bread and circus to the mediocres, is the only thing they deserve". Madona is the only thing you deserve dumb people. She is mediocre and so you all. If she thinks is necessary to show her naked butt in the middle of 5th avenue to succeed she does. But I'm happy, because the best things is always reserved to superior people, and not to sheeps and mediocres followers like you 
 The monologues are intended to be delivered to a live audience. A book simply cannot give the same experience of support and shared understanding. The monologues are a series of snippets intended to raise issues of female anatomy, sexuality, and violence against women. Though ranging from humorous to disconcerting, the monologues are ultimately unsatisfying.  The author, previously a lawyer, seems to think that knowledge of vaginas is a suppressed topic, which has wide consequences. To get past inhibitions, the monologues encourage self-examination and considering what a vagina would wear, say, and smell like. She includes several sexual episodes in which attention to vaginas seems to be emphasized. The monologues on female genital mutilation and ethnic rape are disturbing.   It's really pretty difficult to take this book seriously. One minute one is reading about clothing for a vagina, and the consequences of ethnic rape the next. One topic is silly; the other screams for thorough treatment. It is highly debatable that the topic of vaginal ignorance will lead to understanding social and political systems that permit violence against women.  There is no attempt to address the overall state of sexual knowledge and sexual social conventions in the greater society. If vaginal ignorance is an issue, it can only be the tip of the iceberg.   A person would have to be awfully suppressed or ignorant to be unaware of the factual information in the book. The humor is insufficient to carry the book. The monologues are so brief that the book is filled by an exaggerated forward which discusses the importance of vaginas in history and by a call for participation on college campuses of V-Day, celebrations based on the monologues. This book will appeal to the faithful, and few others.  
 The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.    All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.    The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment.  
 Peter Lynch's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success.  I used to believe things I read in books because a good publisher like Simon and Schuster would publish it.  I counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling.  I also avoided "reading tealeaves" like drawing trendlines on what I was actually concerned about THE PRICE of the stock!  Now I make a living "reading tealeaves" and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up.      My suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like John murphys Technical Analysis of the financial markets.  Start there then go on to learn more advanced TA.  I also like Investor's Business Daily-BUT it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand IBD.  I also swingtrade - hold stocks for 2-5 days sometimes longer.     
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library

 Just received this book and am returning it pronto. It starts out picturing a kid in a classroom feeling he has nothing to write about because he's not rich like the other kids. It actually suggests giving kids ideas for writing through such life experiences as their parents fighting and them having holes in their socks, to such imaginary experiences as a tree falling on their house and killing their mother in her sleep!! Give me a break! There are MUCH better books out there -- I plan to keep the other 6 writing books for kids that I ordered from Amazon. 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 I thought the "mafia did it" theory had been thoroughly discredited by now. Actually, it has been discredited. With all due respect to Mr. Palamara, this book is hardly the best book on the JFK assasination. It's not even close to being the best. The best book on the murder of JFK is John Armstrong's 'Harvey & Lee', a thoroughly documented tome that proves that there were two people using the name Lee Harvey Oswald, one a native Russian speaking man who's family came to the U.S. and who was put into a "false defector" program run by the State Department and CIA (Harvey), the other the real Lee Harvey Oswald (Lee) who was working with Ruby, Ferrie, Shaw, Bannister and others in gun running and anti-Castro activities and who helped set up Harvey as the patsy. Armstrong's book puts everything into perspective. Ultimate Sacrifice is barely worth your time to read. 
 This set was produced way too early. Disney made too few of these sets (although at the time it was released only 15 percent of Americans had a DVD Player) To further insult Disney fans they put in a stupid sequel? I mean come on, just put in Lion King 1 at least, or a movie that was a little older. This set should be burned, I'm a collector and I don't even think personally that it has any collector value as all the movies are being released (Lady & the Tramp on 2/28/06 and Little Mermaid 10/06) So whatever, wait for the PLATINUM 2 Disc Sets. I still have my 101 Dalmations on Laserdisc :) 
 Okay. The premise of this movie had wings. I mean here we have a crazed asylum patient trapped in a spooky hospital for eternity trying to get out.  Fun stuff..right. Not in the hands of this director. I mean, when the only good scare devices you can offer up are an exploding clown and a dog thats had it's day, your in trouble, Mr. Director. Okay..lets try to right some wrongs done by this movie.  Right- Scary Hospital  Wrong- Un Scary plot devices  Right- Dead people making twitching movements Wrong- Exploding Clowns and rushes of violent air ala Evil Dead-       but much worse  Right- My complete and utter hate for the jock in the movie Wrong- My complete and utter hate for all of the actors in this         movie- I mean, come on who in the hell was this Shaft         wannabe and why didn't that dead dog rip a whole in his         cranium before we had to sit through all of his inane        epileptic dialogue.  Right- Use of confined spaces, like an elevator to heighten the         spooky.  Wrong- Too much use of going up the elevator and down the           elevator. I mean if there is such a thing as elevator           sickness, I had it.  Right- The film makers hearts were in the right place with an         attempt to do something a little different.  Wrong- Hey Bubs, listen. This day and age of horror..a little        different is like shooting yourself in the foot.         We horror fans expect more now days..even from grade B        movies.  Wrong- This was obviously a lame attempt to run with the big          dogs aka: Session 9.  Right- Okay everybody makes a big deal about them creeping          past that ghost. They say.."Oh what an intelligent        thing  to do." What? How the helk is that intelligent?          That ghost could have ghost rabies or something!  Okay, I digress. See this film only if you would like to see a rubber clown explode and a dog with no skin. Other than that, don't say I didn't warn ya 
 Pretty much lots and lots of "soapbox" chat without much actual practical information. Not recommende 
 I found The Dragon Queen at my local library and enjoyed reading it very much.  I then picked up The Raven Warrior and although I made it through the book, I was disappointed in the modern dialogue that permeated the book.  I will probably read the third book when it comes out, but hope she focuses on the action rather than the attempts to be witty, which are totally inappropriate for this genre of book 
 This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable 
 This movie is horrible. I even found the terror that was Jaws: the Revenge better than this. I'll list some of the things that made this movie bad. 1. The acting was horrible 2. the special effect were even worse than the acting 3. The kids were smarter than the adults (thats how you know its a corny kids movie) 4. The jokes fell flat every singal time 5. The script was horrible 6. 95% of the movie you could tell was on a blue screen I know they were targeting this movie for younger audiences but get real I've seen alot of family movies that both kids, teenagers, and adults can enjoy. I felt tortured threw this entire movie. I was Praying that it would end and I could leave. Don't buy this movie. Hell don't even rent it. Its just that bad 
 OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
 This book is a complete waste of time for both the beginner and especially the non-beginner. The author spends a great deal of time trying to be funny and wastes the reader's time and energy. He should have spent more time giving content. He does not give even the beginner much concrete advice. I would strongly suggest you find another book; his book has very little value. There are better books for the beginner in networking 
 But why glorify such subject matter? The Academy holds this movie up as a high-point of artistic achievement. Getting to know the workings of a psychotic mind can enrich you life, apparently 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I don't see what the fascination is with this guy! Okay, the guy can play guitar, but so can millions of other people! YAWWWNNNN 
 After reading several really good Historical Fiction books of late I tried this book and was very disappointed.  Another reviewer remarked on it being tedious and I must agree.  I did not consider this historical fiction, rather it was a very predictable romance novel. If you like that kind of book then this book should be for you but if you are wanting something with much historical substance then this book is not for you. Serious Historical Fiction readers be warned; avoid this one.  
 It was a confusing book. It was an O.K. book. It was very touching at the end. I liked the part when Jessie helped the people on the boat 
 I bought this book last month due to some good feedbacks. But when I read, it seems the book is too much unnecessary words just to make it look thick but the actual content is thin. I would recommend to learn from the help section of the flash program itself. It's much more clear and right to the point not like this book. From there then google up and you will find a lot of more better tutorials than this book and best of all, it's free 
 The book uses almost two hundred pages to state that you should invest using ETF's, that China will grow for many years, that dollar is going down due debt, that oys should use call options when prices rise and put options when they decline. Constant repetition of these same simple ideas throughout the book. I do not know who this book is for, serious investors will learn nothing new and beginning investors certainly should not invest via options.     
 This book is a great way to help with analyzing yourself, but it doesn't help you to fix any of the reasons that you are lacking self worth. It will help you save a few buck with a counselor, you can just write a list of the things that hit home as you thumb through this short little book 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 The book is very narrow minded. The book does not have information on great bands. It mostly contains information on some good bands. There are many other great singles that the writer fails to mention.  Many Beatles songs are not listed. Led Zepplin's name is not even mentioned, U2 is a band to be forgotten by this writer.  Elvis does not have many songs listed here.  I am not sure what kind of discrimination is going on here, but I do not believe that the writer has a radio or a CD player. He may have received money from thes bands to show that they have a good single. This book is worth as much as the paper costs to make it.  If you find a copy of this it may be good to burn in the fireplace. It will be a good firestarter, just add lighter fluid 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
   Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the  type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another    publisher's edition 
 I used the feature of searching and reading to check it out right here, online.  I searched for their write-up of amazon.com.  And it's there, on page 60.  Read those pages first.  If you think the authors give an intelligent and insightful perspective on Amazon's role in the internet bubble, then by all means buy and read the book 
 Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions 
 I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play 
 If you are impressed by the fact that this protocal is recommeded by Andrew Weil, go read about him some.  This protocal may work, but there is no evidence for it. The author presents a book full of statements, unverified case studies, and an unsupported study alleging 75 individuals with no FDA or governmental association for the study.  The herbal regimen recommended, using the supplies from the recommended HepaPro corporation costs about [money] per month including discounts, less shipping.  After about a year of this, if your Hep C LFTs are normalized, the maintenance regimen is about [money] per  month - forever 
 As the American half of a Yank-Aussie binational relationship, I am pleased to see another entry in the small but growing library of books on LGBT immigration (especially to Australia, as my partner and I are pinning our entire future on Australia's just and humane approach to same-sex immigration).  Unfortunately, one can learn more about the _right_ way to go about _legal_ immigration to Australia from the country's own immigration Web site and from the smattering of printed literature than from this book.  The author's personal experience is in no way useful, and, sadly, contributes to the misinformed notion that lesbian and gay immigrants are just trying to take advantage of the system.  In my experience (and the author's experience in no way even remotely resembles my own), nothing could be further from the truth.  As the co-founder of a LGBT immigration-rights group, I can attest that the vast majority of binational couples stay well within the letter (and spirit) of the law, regardless of their respective countries.  Yes, often the end result is a break-up -- but that is not a commentary on the nature of same-sex relationships; unless you have been forcibly separated from your life partner due to discriminatory and downright cruel immigration policy that strips you of the right to marry or sponsor your foreign-born partner -- while allowing any two drunken heterosexuals to hitch up in a Las Vegas chapel five minutes after meeting -- you cannot possibly comprehend the hellish strain on even the strongest relationship.  The author presents a skewed picture of same-sex binational couples -- both in practice and in diversity (excuse me, but not all binational couples are male) -- and is giving the rest of us a bad name.  The upshot:  Don't buy this book.  If you want a true picture of same-sex immigration to Australia (or any of the other 15 countries that offer same-sex immigration), talk to other binational couples (we're all over the Web!), and get the real story from the Australian embassy Web site.  You owe it to yourself, and your partner, to do everything above-board.  Australia is NOT the United States; Oz is light-years beyond the U.S. in terms of fair, sane, and humane immigration policy.  If your relationship is genuine, you do NOT have to resort to dirty tricks 
 This perfume is very mediocre. One of my friends loved it and on the spur of the moment I decided to give it a try. What a waste! Its not unpleasant but so unremarkable that 10 seconds after spraying you forget what it smells like. Wouldn't be buying it again 
 Actually I was quite disappointed. I did not expected it to be very quantitative but I think he is repeating himself all along. I'd rather have an idea explained once and clearly than 3 times, because at the 3 rd time I get bored and then I may miss something interesting. May be though he could not sell his book at such a price if it were shorter. Moreover, his approach to quant is more of a cooking receipe. I dont see the point of having a book with calculus without justification. Or you want it to be read by non quant and you don't put cooking receipe but only few numbers, or you want it to be more quanti and you don't put receipe but explanations. Anyway...it is a try on a non easy subject 
 I bought this CD for my girlfriend who has gotten into Irish folk music just recently. She quite likes it but I was  disappointed with it.  The problem with The Corrs and some other Irish & English performers is that they feel a need to adopt a 'mid-atlantic' accent while singing, which means much of their native tongue goes missing. This works well for pop & rock etc but less so for folk singing.  Irish artists like Maura O'Connell, Mary Black or even Enya in a pinch could have performed any of these songs better than The Corrs.  I did note that acoustic guitars made in Northern Ireland were used on the CD - that was a nice touch. Otherwise The Corrs should stick to the bubble gum, eye candy pop singing they're used to 
 I recently found these authors and have been devouring the Pendergast series with great enthusiasm. Having worked my way down the list to "Brimstone", I opened the book with great excitement. Unfortunately I closed it with great disappointment. The book started off with a bang, fizzled in the next 400 pages, and a good 1/3 of the book could have been left out entirely. Much as I want to give the book three stars, the ridiculous plot just won't let me. The plot started off interesting and spooky but when the motive for the murder was introduced, it was so mundane and silly, I put down the book and laughed out loud. After that I had to force myself to finish it.   I didn't like Hayward in "Reliquary" because she came across as a tired, clichï¿½d feminist (act tough and swear like a man to get accepted).  The subplot involving her and the equally tired, clichï¿½d "Christian nut cases" was so dull it should be bottled and sold as Valium. Eventually I skipped over all those chapters as they lent nothing to the main plot. The abrupt, exceedingly premature office sex scene between Hayward and D'Agosta was unbelievable from numerous viewpoints: 1) no sexual tension had been allowed to build between them. The sex simply came out of nowhere and was thrown into our faces with all the subtlety of a gorilla at the dinner table. 2) the idea that a "by the book" female police captain would risk her career by having sex in her own office while on duty with a co-worker just didn't ring true. Oddly, the relationship was then dropped until the final pages.   Agent Pendergast, whom I have adored previously, was the only thing that kept me reading, and even he was allowed to go so far off the deep end (he deduces the entire murder motive from a piece of horsehair - Come on!) that he lost the endearing characteristics present in the earlier books. Even the attempt to introduce Viola as a love interest for Pendergast failed (they looked into each others eyes for a breathless minute - PUH-lease!). Please guys, no more romance. Stick with what you do best and leave the romance to Danielle Steele.

 This mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny. Considering the comedic caliber of its two stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, I was expecting a laugh riot, but that's not what this is. It's not their fault, it's the scriptwriter's. I guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper, but that humor just didn't translate to the screen, despite the best efforts of Mssrs. Crystal and Williams. They deserve better, and so do we 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I'm disappointed by this album. This is hard to write since I love  Mojave's other CDs.  They established a high standard with their other albums and to me they don't match it on this one. Some melodies are fine. Halstead is a master of tunes, just not full time anymore.  It's a bit too sweet( especially "you said it before"). Or too speedy, or I find the voice too processed. Also too many cliches. Everyone plays well, though. No problem with the new pedal steel guitar player, he's good.  But where's the intimacy and sincerity of Neil's solo album?  Where are the superb arrangments and incredible songs of "out of tune"? Or the nice harmonies and beautiful songs of "ask me..."? On this CD, I like "most days" a lot, I'll be enjoying that one for a long time. Rachel is more present on this song which is good.   I like "big star baby" especially the melody and voice in the verses (he's one of my favorite singers). I also like "breaking the ice" and "running with your eyes closed". "Mutineer"is allright too. "Truck driving man" is OK ( rocks). I hate "to hold your tiny toes" (how can someone with such talent  not realise it's garbage?), don't like "just a boy", don't care for "ghostship waiting" and find "kill the lights" irritating. That's 4 songs I don't care for! For me their peak was "out of tune", one of my favorite albums, period, by the way also kind of uppidy, builing up and maturing from "Ask me tomorrow" which I love too. "Excuses.." had TWO songs I don't listen to, the rest is top notch.  "Spoon and rafter" had THREE songs I listened to twice, and avoid  , in the center (I find "hard to miss you" annoying). I like or love the rest. In the same genre check "trembling blue sars", you may have a good surprise.    
 I had worn out my copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs so I thought I would try something new.  Bad decision.  There are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really don't feel one exercise before you move on to the next.  In addition, you really need to buy the "Firm Sculpting Stick" to make many of the exercises work, which I found insulting and rather marketing-minded.  I am sending this back 
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom.  Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets.  The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees.  When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened.  They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up.  In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand.  Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive! 
 I still search in vain for the version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses that I found at two o'clock in the morning on HBO. This is not it.  Colin Firth and Annette Bening are both very competent, experienced actors, so I must conclude that it's the script that's abysmal. It lacks all the passion and cruelty that this story is theoretically about. Cruel Intentions was a a better retelling.    Meg Tilly, as Madame de Tourvel, can't get comfortable with her lines, never mind trying to hide her very American accent, and is implausible as a love interest because of a stiffness that rivals Keanu Reeves'. Fairuza Balk is just TOO young in appearance; her performance goes beyond naivete into jailbait, and the yuck factor of 30-something Firth and 14 or 15 (in appearance, anyway) year-old Balk destroys any enjoyment of any scene involving the pair of them.  To be succinct, Dangerous Liaisons is predicated on cruelty, passion, and tragedy. This movie fails on all three counts. Neither Firth nor Bening comes off as cunning or manipulative; rather, clumsy and stupid. There is no spark between them. I bought this DVD based on Amazon recommendations and I have to say, Glenn Close and John Malkovich (shocking, considering it's Malkovich) absolutely set the screen on fire in their version of Dangerous Liaisons. Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman were perfect, and Keanu Reeves' appearance was mercifully brief.  If you're looking for Dangerous Liaisons, Valmont is not worth your money or your time. Your money would be better spent on a different version 
 I have read some of her other books and I believe this one was not up to the others. I found the character very "whiney" and not very redeeming. This book seemed more "cookie cutter" and not as funny and/or clever as her others. I was disappointed-especially in the ending and her choices 
 This book is nothing more than speculation and an author reading his own fantasies into what he would like to see Jesus representing. There is not a bit of conclusive evidence throughout this book that substantiates his claims. Also I noticed that there were several other reviews of this book that were very critical of it. It seems they were deleted. How convenient. 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 It is very useful, but it is TOO big. Last week, I was looking on the English section and I discovered that almost half of page 723 is torn. 
 Since Good in Bed and In her Shoes Jennifer's books have continued to get worse.  Her first 2 books were fabulous but Little Earthquakes, Goodnight Nobody and The Guy Not Taken show her progressively becoming more boring.  I dont know if its because her life has changed and she is not having the fun exciting life of a single woman, but her books are not as good as they were.  The Guy Not taken is a compilation of short stories.  There are a couple of high points in the book but they are few and far between.  The problem with these stories is just are you are beginning to relate to the characters the story is over and you are moving onto the next one.  I will continue to read her and give her one more shot, but I am not sure how many one more shots I have in me to give to her.  
 With the experience and access of Dick Couch that is touted on the inside flap, I expected something more than what I got. This is a very "novelly" non-fiction book that is light on new or original information, and heavy on the compliments.  SEALs, some of our best and bravest, have withstood some pretty intense criticism as to thier performance in Afghanistan and Iraq - I was particularly interested in getting some insight on that topic - none to be found.   There have been few quality books written on the conflict - mostly due to the covert nature of many of the units currently involved - but you cannot help but notice the sense of inter-service jockeying in the books that have come out. Roberts Ridge, and Down Range both paint glimmering portraits of the SEALS, while "Not a Good Day to Die" really skewers them. In my review of "Not a Good Day.." I point out that Naylor is a writer for the Army times; and mention that there may be some alterior motives for slamming the DEVGRU/SEAL performance in Anaconda, but after reading this and other books, I think his work is superior, and far less biased.  
 Don't waste your money.  Buy the 8 in pan.  It's a real All-Clad.  As I read these reviews, I keep seeing people rave about how good All-Clad is, not really how an individual pan actually performers.  Yes, I have All-Clad.  Lots of All-Clad.  When the company brings out a new pan, I buy it.  In the small pans that I use the most, I am likely to have 2 of each.  But, I don't recommend the 7-? inch.  All-Clad likes to bring out pans that are almost a `try me'; as was the case with the 7 ? inch and 1 qt pan a few years ago.  They priced them attractively.  To me the pan is handle heavy.  It does not sit properly on my electric stove.  Thus it has poor heat conductivity.  For a few dollars more, buy the 8 inch fry pan.  The 8 inch is US made, and the 7 ? inch is imported.  
 I wish I'd read the Amazon review before buying this book.  Some of the information is useful and I do agree with the bits about the uselessness of store bought junky plastic toys and stupid childrens' music but the following really stood out:  1) the authors just HAD to take the opportunity to drive the message home that bottle feeding babies and pain relief during childbirth is a bad bad thing.  If there is one thing I detest, it is people that think it's their right to tell women how to feed their babies, or not to use pain relief.  I'd like to see if the authors visit their dentist and not get some pain relief.  Absolutely backwards and outright offensive.  2) you can begin to toilet train at 12-15 months.  What a joke!  What the authors describe is oten referred to as "toilet timing".    It is widely advised by numerous child health experts that a child is not reading to be toilet trained until much later as they lack the mental ability to understand the whole toilet thing when they're that young.  And I had to laugh at the statistic of how many children were toilet trained at that young age many years ago, what a joke!  3) the breastfeeding bits are a joke, I'm sure breastfeeding consultants the world over would be horrified at the "advice" here.  4) the low bed.  I understand the theory behind it but get real!  They say that children in cots have fallen and sustained spinal and head injuries.  Gee, and that doesn't happen with kids that fall against a wall or low wooden toyshelf or wooden toys?  What they suggest is extremely unsafe-- using bolsters or cushions around the bed: SIDS RISK #1.  Not tucking a blanket in: SIDS RISK #2.  Actually that second one is so bad it deserves more than one check point.  If you've been living under a rock recently you probably don't know that a loose blanket exponentially increases the risk of suffocation.  5) parts of the authors' philopsophies seem to completely contradict Montessori philosophy.  I will be very interested to know how Montessori teachers feel about this book.  6) Parents are baaaad if they choose to use disposable nappies.  I started off with cloth for my son who unfortunately was a really big wee-er.  I was constantly changing nappies, constantly pailing nappies, constantly washing nappies, constantly flushing poo off liners, constantly hanging out nappies, constantly folding nappies.  Coupled with sleep deprivation and not getting any other work done, as well as my enjoyment of motherhood being reduced, I switched to disposables when I found out I could use a recycling service.  Result?  HOURS more free to spend with my son.  So much for the authors' rubbish about valuable interaction time with your baby being reduced because you're not changing a disposable as much.  I haven't read the bit about no fences around the school and dont know if I will bother reading anymore.  Point number 1 up there made me want to stop altogether.  I wouldn't recommend this book.  I wish I could get my money back.  As lots of other reviewers have said, it's a jumbled mess 
 Without a doubt, Understanding The Bible, 6th Edition, is a "hatchet job" on the Bible and, as a result, will test the faith of Jews and Christians alike.  But fear not!  Those who are even moderately confident in their religion will see through the author's relentlessly atheistic opinions and view it as an untapped gold mine for the Christian apologetics crowd.  When Mr. Harris (in his chapter bibliographies) recommends, among others, the works of those false witnesses over at the "Jesus Seminar", R.Funk, et al, and their New Thought babblings, then I came to understand the real truth about this book and the author's deceptive intentions.  I have only one thought for those unbelievers who think the Bible and Christ's teachings are wrong and pure folly.  If it is so; if Christianity is wrong, then there can be only ONE FOLLY that replaces it:  the folly of trying to pretend that there is some meaningful reason for life on this earth.     I feel truly sorry for Mr. Harris and those frantic souls similarly aligned; they have nothing but death in a void as their final reward.  This is why they are so angry, pessimistic and cynical in their religious criticism.  As Thomas  Kempis said in My Imitation of Christ (early 1400's) , "All carnal joys enter pleasantly, but in the end bring remorse and death."  As a result, "There is no peace in the heart of a carnal man."  May God bless and keep you all.  Amen. 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 When surgical resident Josie is not second guessing her chosen career path or putting herself down, she is either lusting after sexy surgeon Houston, or doing something pretty klutzy. He is hot and bothered by what she considers her "chunky body" so what does he do - he takes her in a broom closet so that they can both get each other out of their systems.   Of course, the best laid plans and all that... Soon they are panting for each other even more, and when an accident leaves Houston without the use of his gifted hands, he's faced with the possibility of a life outside of the operating room and in need of Josie now more than ever.  So many of McCarthy's novels sacrifice plot and story for pushing-the-envelope sex scenes that border on an anatomy lesson. Perhaps in more "gifted hands," the story could have been better (or at the very least, more fleshed out). But the characters lack chemistry - and Josie is so unappealing - we know this because she beats us over the head with all her flaws over and over and over... With the price of trade paperbacks, and the lack of storyline, you'd be smart to get this one from your local library 
 Three things are necessary to make a good translation of the Quran into English: mastery of English, mastery of Arabic and knowledge of islamic history/faith. Arberry's has great command of the English language but unfortunately he comes short in his knowledge of the Arabic language and Islam. This makes his translation a beautiful read, but extremely inaccurate and even plainly wrong in crucial parts. For a much better translation I would recommended Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin. Pickthall's translation also is good, but difficult to read.  
 On this recording Joni Mitchell sounds like she's singing in a bad piano bar. Never thought she'd be a lounge singer. I've listened to this CD only once because I want to remember her as the Joni Mitchell of the sixties and seventies 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 Of all the books which dominated the discussion of analytic philosophy in the 90s, John McDowell's *Mind and World* was actually the one which most nearly brought home the prize of great philosophy without naughty bits: and this most nearly in the form of an inversion of Lukacs, "Reification and the Consciousness of the Professoriat".  His early Oxgaffes having been forgotten, McDowell was here free to offer an "unpolitical" account of contemporary thought drawing heavily from classic works.  But if the result is not quite Robert Brandom's linguistic Leninism, the reader ends up getting a story about "who's to be master" that has a little too much excitement squeezed into McDowell's oscillating queries.  Much as Brandom makes a hash of the relationship between formal semantics and "inferentialism", McDowell's account of Hegel's relationship to *Bildung* does not even crib Gadamer's "historically effective consciousness" as a corrective to his "uncritical" eudaemonism (those interested in Hegel's intellectual relationship to Aristotle would do well to look at Alfredo Ferrarin's book instead) -- and the excitement one is  forever waiting on with respect to Sellars is pressed into service for a thoroughly unserviceable treatment of Hegel's remark "in thinking, I am free, because I am not in an other" -- very much the product of Stoic philosophy, and very much militating against the "therapeutic" story about non-conceptual content directly following (with apologies rendered to Peacocke for his rather more serviceable story).   Is any of this that objectionable?  No, and although McDowell's work was very much "in a vogue" for a while (i.e., served upon you according to his lecture specifications) this (as well as his essays) is fine reading concerning stylistics with respect to thoughts of the form "whereof we cannot speak..."  But none of it is as thoroughly "Wittgensteinian" as presented, and if McDowell can still coherently be accused of rendering a disservice to that philosopher this heavily syncretist work must be counted as one such.  I expect this is not the case, however, and as such cannot in good conscience recommend this book to interested readers: if you are in the grip of a worry, perhaps you should stay there, and if you feel differently perhaps being notified of your pseudo-problems will not help overmuch.  Something of a lecture-stuffer 
 DiLorenzo's poorly-written "history" novel is little more than a regurtitation of Mises' and Hayeck's economic theory, unartfully paired with a selection of historical facts, perverted into poor and nauseatingly repetitive conclusions. DiLorenzo's inability to craft English sentences with a subject and object is not quite as disturbing as his inability to preserve historical integrity. He has presented no "myth busters" to anyone who has read an American historical text in the past decade. I am a capitalist, and for the most part agree with DiLorenzo's standpoint. However, he could have made a legitimate argument without making sensationalist, exaggerated (and often flat out incorrect) claims. Any two-hundred-fifty page novel that could be condensensed into a fifteen page essay isn't worth your $26 bucks. 
 Loved it, the first day.  Hated it ever since.  Right out of the box, it worked like a champ, sounded good, used my wife's skyfi2 in it, no problems.  Used the skyfi2 receiver it came with in the car the next day, again, no problems with the XM receiver, but the boombox is dead.  If you turn the volume UP ALL THE WAY, you get a little pop and crackle, thats it.  sounds like the internal amps are blown.  It does this with CD/FM/XM.  Returned it to place of purchase, I've been waitting two weeks for a replacement to come in.  During that time, I'm reading reviews and understanding why its taking so long.  It does appear to be a MAJOR problem that Delphi should own up to.  I'm not the only one with sound problems.  
 This book is horrible! Repetitive, verbose - a total waste of a busy nursing student's time. 
 A dreadful movie depicting men as macho s#$! and women as tarts.  This was made in an era when people wore revolting tight stretch denims and hung out in pool halls and bars.  It was also made to capitalise on the popularity of Patrick Swayze who had just appeared in the over-rated 80's teen musical "Dirty Dancing".   A very pointless movie is "Roadhouse".  It does not deserve a bare bones DVD release let alone this new special edition.  Is there really a market out there for rubbish like this, or am I the only one with taste in movies 
 The only reason you would need cliff notes for this book is if you are lazy or short on time and theres a test the next day.  Yet the cliff notes arent descriptive enough for you to get the whole book.  I can understand needing cliff notes for the confusing dialect of "tale of two cities", or the background and analysis for "Brave new World", but going through the Catcher in the Rye is a breeze, and the book is enjoyable.  Its one of my favorite books ever.  Dont even bother with these cliff notes 
 I was unaware this "book" is only 4x5 inches.Kind of defeats the purpose of looking at posters.  Man, what a rip off. The type on some of the "posters" is so small,that you will need a magnifying glass to read what band it is for.   Don't waste your mone 
 If this is the generation I am supposed to belong to, I want to disown it.  Ben Stiller's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage, and are now trying to find their way in the world.  The movies messege is that we are a lost generation, but that is not are parent's fault (where this movie tries to lay the blame).  The kids in this movie are just lazy, more or less.  And they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives.  Indeed, Troy (Ethan Hawke) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him.  Winona Ryder plays waify Lelina, who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends.  One day she meets Michael (Ben Stiller) who is their age but has made a good career out of the TV industry.  Ethan hates him for his honest approach to life, and so the battle for Lelina's love begins.  I really wasn't too impressed with this movie, it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool, tortured artist; when they should get off the couch and go get a job 
 The author is well qualified to write this book, but I feel she is writing only for code jockeys. I work in this field and found the book incomprehensible. Clearly some people find the codes very useful, but my one star reflects the books overall value. It is basically uneditied set of personal notes written in a highly esoteric manner. There appears to be no professional editing or formatting. I bought the book because the title makes it look like anyone can create an army of webbots after reading it. If you're not a gifted programmer with specialized knowledge in this field, forget it. I feel bad writing this because I know the author who is a truly fine and brillian person. 
 During Season Three of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, viewers were introduced to Faith, a bold Slayer who loved breaking the rules and testing the limits. A fan favorite, she appeared on the spin-off series Angel on multiple occasions, then came back to BtVS during its final season.   Faith was one of my favorite characters. She was memorably portrayed by actress Eliza Dushku. Many fans wished she had her own spin-off. Those who were loyal readers of the official BtVS/Angel original books also wished for a book that focused solely on Faith.  The book Go Ask Malice is supposed to be Faith's diary, chronicling the time of her callling, and found in the ruins of Sunnydale after the series finale. This means that, from the get-go, the reader is supposed to believe that Faith would 1) keep a diary; and 2) carry it around through multiple moves, from Boston to Sunnydale to Los Angeles, then prison, then out of prison, then back to Sunnydale.  I tried to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story, but I couldn't.  I never stop reading a story once I've started it, but this was really hard to get through. Since it was a diary, it was written in first person, but it didn't sound like Faith's voice to me. I constantly wanted to correct it. It wasn't one hundred percent wrong. Little tidbits were thrown at readers here and there - things and people Faith had said on the show in passing were made into plots and crucial characters - but overall, it never felt right.   For a better taste of Faith fiction, try the short story written by Christopher Golden and Thomas E. Sniegoski in Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. It is brief but powerful, and you'll be wishing Golden and Sniegoski wrote a full Faith novel instead 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 The show is just too fiction unlike X-Men:Evolution, but the actions awesome as well.But was trying to find some romance/drama here but just couldn't. 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 This game is very very hard. The concept sounds cool but i would not recomend to purchas this item. After about the 2nd turn everyone just says this is impossible. Then everyone starts working together, not using the board, not doind the right turn, and looking through all the clue cards. It is not a fun game in my opinio 
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I've been wanting to own this set for some time now and I'm sad to say that I was not impressed at all. The DVD quality for all 3 films is good as far as the picture goes but the sound is mediocre. The first Sabata is OK. Adios Sabata may be a little better but The Return of Sabata was just lame. I like Lee Van Cleef so I guess I had high expectations. I didn't care for many of the same characters making repeated appearances as different people. I watched the 3rd installment last night and I was fighting to stay awake! If you can find it cheap, get it just to say you own it. Otherwise avoid 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, "could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?"  Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.  A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature 
 As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film 
 I thought that this book would be more interactive. Better (and more creative) to draw your own family tree 
 I was present at this open house discussion that this book is based upon because as Assistant to Dr. E. A. Foster, I had requested to be present and was invited by Professor Peter Onuf, one of the authors of this book. Upon arrival I was denied a seat on the panel and told to seat myself in the audience and if I wished to say anything that the "open mike" at the end of the discussion was my conduit. I was immediately opposing this august panel's findings as it applied to the actual DNA findings. In my opinion it was a seemingly overwhelming desire to have the prevailing combined force that DNA had proven Thomas Jefferson guilty of fathering slave children. This book conveys this image for the reader. Many, many statements in this book are absolutely inaccurate and have not been proven by DNA.   The very first page has a Jefferson-Hemings Family Tree that is  outrageous in that it portrays Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings as being the parents of Madison and Eston Hemings (absolutely unproven). A note states that Eston Hemings is "almost" certain  the son of Thomas Jefferson. Are these "authorities" educators or soothsayers?) The notes further state that descendants of Madison Hemings were not tested. This is true, HOWEVER, after deep research I found a deceased son of Madison and suggested to Dr. Foster, the Hemings, Dr. Daniel Jordan, Monticello President, and others that the DNA of William Hemings be tested adainst the Jefferson DNA and also against Eston Hemings DNA. ALL have refused to move forward to test this valuable science......WHY?   Later they suggest that some sort of long term relationship existed between Jefferson and Hemings. How can this otherwise learned group make such an obvious incorrect assertation? This shows their lack of details of the long running controversy. The long believed, by some for obvious reasons , theory that Jefferson fathered Tom (Hemings) Woodson was completely obliteraterd by the DNA test......No Jefferson/Woodson match, thus James Callender was proven a liar. Not only that, it was almost 6 years after Sally returned to Monticello that she had a first recorded child, Harriet I.   An assumption is made that if Jefferson wasn't guilty then some other white man on the plantation was and the Carr brothers are mentioned. This again provides evidence of the very limited knowledge that the authors have of the DNA subject. Thomas Jefferson inherited a mullato named Sandy from his father, Peter. It is not too far removed to see that this man, possibly having Jefferson DNA and sandy or reddish hair, could have fathered "yellow people", as referenced by story tellers. These male offspring, having the Jefferson DNA and physical traits, could have fathered Eston Hemings the ONLY Hemings tested. The original Dr. Foster plan was to "prove or disprove" the Carr brothers implication in this slave parentage. Because Dr. Foster had not given Nature Journal the valuable family genealogy that I had given him, when there was no Carr match with any other of those tested, THEN Nature Journal in the absence of being aware of any other Jefferson, "assumed" and wrote a false and definitive headline that it was Jefferson, yes, just "SOME" Jefferson....but not necessarily Thomas.   It is stated that Jan Lewis, one of the authors, "analyzed" that Jefferson was evading the truth by not denying the rumors. Jefferson DID write his Secretary of the Treasury, Levi Lincoln and Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith that he did admit to seeing a married lady friend when he was young and unmarried BUT that was the only rumor about him that he would admit to and denied the others. Jan lewis is also very anilitical in stating that the white Jeffersons told lies in that they said the Carr brothers implicated themselves as fathers, however DNA told otherwise. It must be remembered that ONLY ONE of Sally's children's DNA was tested. Since the Hemings refuse to test William Hemings (son of Madison), how are we to know that Madison is not one of those referenced by the Carr brothers or one of the others. Annette Gordon-Reed says that Jefferson must be the doting father, described by daughter, Martha, and not the indifferent one described by his son(what proof), Madison. I have no faith at all in what Madison is supposed to have said in the Pike Co., Ohio article. Who could believe that tale about Dolley Madison being present at Monticello when he was born on January 19, 1805.  She was acting as Mr. Jefferson's Hostess and her husband, James Madison was Secretary of State. Are we to believe that she suddenly announces to these two that she has heard that a male slave is to be born at Monticello and she must be present to name him for her husband, James Madison. Never mind that predicting the sex of a child is a fairly late feat. Leaving both men in Washington she heads out in the cold, muddy and frozen roads over rivers and creeks and uphill to Monticello. Never mind also that Monticello was closed and under constuction most of the time when Jefferson was away. The Madison Papers indicate that the Madisons NEVER visited Virginia during the winter from Washington. This book places much glory upon this Pike Co., Ohio article written by Samuel Wetmore, from an abolitionist family.  As for Annette Gordon-Reed......she now states in later versions of her book that DNA does not prove that Jefferson fathered the descendanmt of Eston Hemings. She was also taken to task by the blue ribbon panel of 13 senior scholars known as the Scholars Commission ([...]),for taking and rearranging words and complete meaning of a letter from Ellen Randolph Coolidge (Thomas Jefferson's granddaughter),  to a family member.  This book cites Dr. Foster's statement that the DNA evidence   "neither definitely excludes nor solely impliocates" Jefferson in the paternity of Sally Hemings' children. He has stated this in e-mails to me, in Nature Journal (January 7, 1999), the New York Times article of early 1999 and in other publications. Then HOW and WHY do non-DNA literate "authorities" come rushing forward to assume that since Jefferson owned slaves he "MUST" now to have been found to share Jefferson DNA with a slave descendant. DNA does not honor given names. There are many too many other citations that try to prove anything to substantiate their claims. If the group of contributors to this book wish to do something constructive let them pursue the DNA of another male Hemings, William, and also read what the Scholars Commission Report says. Why don't they challenge those from "the other side of research" to a nationally broadcast debate? So far none of them have come forward for this.    I recommend reading this book to at least learn how a group of people can sway the minds of some people by ignoring the research of the other side. Let us hear BOTH sides of any question.              May I please ask readers to order the new book, "Jefferson Vindicated" with a forward by the distinguished past Director of Monticello. Ordering information may be secured from the cited web pages.             I recognized most of the well recognized names on this panel and knew they were authorities on the slavery issue. Other than Dr. Eugene Foster, none of them knew any of the "nuts and bolts" of the DNA Study that I had participated in advising Dr. Foster in family genealogy and  history and securing sources for DNA study.

 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Leadership depends upon dynamism (action). "Go forward." (p. 53) It means application using past battles as lessons. The author was clear that Patton believed in direct action based on facts. The center of the book stresses Patton's action orientation ad nauseum. The three maxums are speed, simplicity and boldness. In presentation, Patton has the sound of genius and the subtext tells a story of impulsive foolishness, high drama and overcompensation. It is unclear if the author intended to impliy that or if it is misreading in the Paul de Man sense. Pattion was a show and, perhaps, a rebel though that is not clear in the book either. He said "Army regulations are written by those who have never been in battle." (p 248) The author suggests it has something to say about corporate management. What, the author doesn't say. Using polite military terms, the book is S.O.S.(on toast) Go figure. Eric J. Lindblom PhD Harvar 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 If the Clintons were in office during the 1970s, this movie would probably be called ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  And, obviously, the tone would be a lot different.  Every single president who's been in office has had enemies.  The truth is that Bill Clinton came to office and provided his enemies with a target-rich past and present of incompetence and corruption. The guy was in trouble from Day One in office over his serial philandering...and yet foolishly blunders into the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  The mantra that the Friends of Bill foisted upon America and the world--"Everybody does it"--just doesn't hold water.      As far as attacking his "hunters": it wasn't so much a hunt to find dirt on Bill & Hillary, it was more like shooting fish in a barrel.  My question for the most enthusiastic fans of this movie: what would you think of the members of a Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy if they found out that George W. Bush was carrying on an affair in the Oval Office with a 21-year-old girl? Yeah. I thought so 
 My order did not arrive by the expected date of deleivery. It took over one full month from the time i ordered to the time it reached. The protein wasnt sealed and it looked like it was half empty. What basement is this company operating from 
 A PRINCESS AND 8 SAMURAIS BATTLE THE HIKIMA CLAN. THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS 
 Sara Douglass is the kind of writer who really knows how to get your hopes up to the height of Mount Everest and then send you crashing rudely to the ground. This is generally the case with all her books (I tried another series, hoping in vain that she would prove to be a writer I could like), but this one is a great example of everything I don't like about them.  The novel starts with one of the most fun prologues I've ever read. You settle down in your chair/on your bed/wherever you happen to be. You think, "Hey, this is going to be fun!" The book becomes unputdownable, because she's really good at keeping your attention and interest while you're reading it. You finish the book and can't wait to buy the sequel.  If, instead of rushing to the nearest bookstore, you let this book percolate in your mind, you'll realize that, in fact, you've already spent too much money on her. The plot is recycled and given a shiny veneer to trick you into thinking it's original. The characters are flatter than smushed clay. The dialogue - hoo boy, don't get me started on how, halfway through a second reading to try to convince yourself that it's not that bad, you realize that no one in their right minds would ever say the words that Douglass puts in the mouths of her characters. The whole first book was so awkwardly structured that I didn't realize until I (unfortunately) read the second book in this series that the main character is Axis, the hero, not Faraday, the heroine-of-the-moment.   Douglass' real talent is that she can hook a reader in a matter of pages, for which I give her credit - not many writers can do that, and especially not many fantasy writers. But her downfall is that, given some time, her books deteriorate spectacularly. And what's worse is that, after countless earth-shattering, impossible, we'll-never-come-out-alive situations have been effortlessly dealt with (sometimes by the unpardonable cliche of bringing characters - yup, that's plural - back to life), you just stop caring 
 If you can ignore the dated assertions that the Earth is shaped like a top, you still have to swallow 1000+ pages of Fort's inane philosophical musings on subjects that have potential. Rather than explore in detail a specific time when, say, it rained fish, Fort is content to give the reader a list of all such events that occurred and use this as a springboard to prove (or prove-unprove as he would say) that there are magical lands in the sky 
 If this would have been the first James Patterson book I ever read, it would have been the last (and that would have been a shame!).  Too gory (without any real purpose), too many characters (who are very one-dimensional) and too much stuff going.  That being said, I did quit reading this book about 1/3 of the way through (which I hardly ever do).  Maybe I missed out on the good stuff in the last part of the book, but I really doubt it 
 I was very disappointed in this CD.  I like her and have been a fan for years.  I think the piano accompaniment didn't do her justice either.  I listened to half and couldn't be bothered to finish the rest.  I was so disappointed, especially since I had read such good reviews of it 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 The Tarot Deck itself was missing the Death Card it had  two of the The Hanged Man Card. The quality of material used for the cards were very thin. Very disappointed with overall quality of the deck. I'm in the process of returning this purchase and I just recived it this afternoon in the mail.  
 This book sucks, plain and simple.  DO NOT TRY TO LEARN FROM IT.  They don't actually explain how to do anything and give confusing, if any, explanation of the examples.  Then the back of the chapter exercises have retarded questions asking you to do stuff that they never explained how to do even.  For example : "Add, subtract, and multiply the following numbers without converting to decimal."  The most this was explained in the chapter is that it was possible, but never said how the freakin' hell to do it.  Everything, all the fundamental concepts, are left to you, the reader, to figure out what the hell it is on your own.  The most this book tells you is the names of the fundamentals 
 I bought this DVD because I really adore the Strokes.  Good music, good people, good style...not so good documentary.  Whoever made this video should not make anymore at all!  The strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures & 10 second clips of them & the "exclusive interviews" were not that exclusive.  No sound from any of the strokes & no interviews with them...I can go on.  I mean c'mon...a documentary of the Strokes should at least have the Strokes in it, right 
 Bernardi likes to verb his wordage.  This acts to weird his language.  From whence does all this useless anger come?  Reading this and "Race in Space" -an IDENTICAL book- depressed me almost as much as forum  columns in the Daily Northwestern do.  The examples of symbolism forming  the basis for these two books' thesises are,  while of obvious  interpretation to the authors,  mere fluff to each reader possessing  operational neural function 
 This product's write-up says it's both PC and Mac compatible. This is not true in any fashion. On a Mac, it will either freeze your machine on the start up of the app. or it will not install at all. We tried to install it on six different Macs (different ages, laptop, tower, G3, G4). It would not run on any of these extremely well-maintained machines - all of them exceeded the minimum system requirements outlined on the Suze Orman box. We tried every trick we knew to get it to work (restarting, one button/two button mouse, copying to the desktop, etc.) This thing will not run on a Mac. We called Suze's tech support and they offered the obvious solution of "try clicking it again real fast". When, of course, that didn't work their only other solution/brush-off was an offer to refund (if we could supply all the appropriate paperwork). I was prepping for a trip. I didn't need a dozen dollars back. I needed to put my affairs in order before flying. I'd already waited over a week for the thing to arrive. Suze's tech people did admit that there had been some difficulties running the software on "newer Macs". Well, we went back as far as the system requirements allowed. This does not run on a Mac. Buy something else 
 I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!! This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of "A Jolly Corner"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs  male ego driven self-delusion.  "Washington Square" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.  I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form. 
 All of Disneys direct to video follow ups are really starting to get tiresome. They are fast cheap ways to profit off the original and have no reason to excist. Tarzan 2 is no exception. The original Tarzan is a Disney classic. A great story of action, love, and trying to find your place in the world. Afterwords came the Legend of Tarzan series. Which featured inferior animation but decent stories. Tarzan 2 does surprise me by being the first direct to video sequel to have animation on par with the original. Breaking a long sucky tradition of sequels with inferior animation. Unfortunitly the story is below the quality of even most of the television episodes. It takes place sometime in the middle of the original sometime during the "Son of Man" song. It involves Tarzan feeling he is a danger to his family and runing away to find out what he is. The story has no strong villian, no real threats, and a cheesy as hell conflict resolution. All the elements of a kids movie that everyone over puberty will have a problem with. A real shame considering the orginal could be enjoyed equally by kids and adults. It has its cute momments and is better then many of Disneys very poor direct to video but thats not saying much going against garbage like The Lion King 1 1/2. The DVD has superb picture and sound. Why Disney denies DTS on the originls but gives it to its inferior sequels I don't know. An Ok little movie for the kids but Tarzan 2 leaves alot to be desired from adult fans of the original 
 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia. Daryl Hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid. Tom was also perfect for the role. I can't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, though, but it wasn't bad. I can't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie. I let my kids watch it finally together with my niece. We found ourselves teary-eyed in the end. It was just so touching, we couldn't help it. Even the theme song sang by Rita Coolidge was perfect for the ending. For those who wanna know, the title is "Love came for me".  I'm glad I purchased the anniversary edition. I have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what I needed. It would have been better if DTS was used but I'm not complaining. For those who are thinking of getting this, I hope you make the decision to do so. Tom Hanks is a certified great actor. This movie will soon be in line with the classics like "Gone with the wind" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's". It's already a collector's item. You won't regret it! Besides, love stories don't get out of style 
 This is one of the worst textbooks i have ever used. The book uses lame metaphors. The style of writing is also horrible. It is very hard to understand and has a lot of "fluff" information. I do not suggest any AP US history students to read this for the AP exam 
 Compared to the wit and flair I had expected, I found this volume boring and dull. It is largely a compilation (with Suskin providing brief notes) of theatrical reviews. Approach this with care if, as I did, you searched on a star's name and found a mention in this book - it may be only one line.   I had expected great humour, inside knowledge, entertaining stories of the backstage. Frankly, I wish I had kept the receipt - I would have returned it the next day 
 This book is an unresearched, fictional account of a much more complicated business.  Borns can't interview a few people over two months and write something that has anything to do with the comedy business.  Total  rubbish!. It was used as a vehicle for a climber in the business to do just  that.  It was immediatly in the bins at KMart and sat there for a year.   Don't waste your money.  By the way, if she's such a great author, where's  anything else she's written??  She got a ten thousand dollar advance, and  the publisher rues the day they did that 
 I'm sorry that I bought this book.  The grammar is terrible, and the author (or his editor) doesn't even know the difference between principal and principle.  The author cannot settle on one word or phrase for a concept, but generally, and repeatedly uses three.  Save your money 
 For some time I was very interested in raw foods, but disliked all the recipes that relied on fruit and grains as staples.  Upon reading all the positive reviews of this book and hearing about how it de-emphasized the fruit and grains, I was very gung-ho about ordering it.  I now use this book as a paperweight, because it isn't really good for anything else.  The "science" outlined in the beginning of the book is laughable.  I googled high and low to find any substantiating evidence of the claims the author made concerning pleomorphism and came up with no corroborating facts from any respectable source (quacks abounded, however).  "Fine," I thought, "just because he's a lunatic doesn't mean the recipes can't be tasty."  Well let me tell you, everything I have made out of this book has tasted absolutely terrible.  Vile, even.  It turned me off of broccoli for 2 months.  One time I spend a whole free afternoon making a lovely-looking 3-course raw meal for my fiance and myself using the recipes from this book (carrot ginger soup, fake sushi, and a blueberry pie with pecan crust), and the result was so unappetizing that we had to toss it all in the trash and go out to eat.  I am normally a very good cook (or uncook), so I place blame squarely on the recipes and not on my own abilities.  Please, for your own sake, do not buy this book.  Or at least take my copy, because I sure don't want it anymore.  I give it 2 stars only because the book itself is so attractive looking (seriously, the paper it's printed on is really glossy and nice) 
 This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen.  I was expecting it to be bad, but this movie just went beyond that 
 This CD is totally boring, even when "Penny Lane" comes along to "pick things up", 'cause by the time "Penny Lane" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, "Penny Lane" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception.  But what the heck is so great about this CD?  Nothing 
 I find interweaving of religion into every single aspect of societal thinking out-dated and without sense. Religion does not deserve justification or a voice in areas where it causes nothing but trouble - gender, race, etc. Gender "reconciliation," like race "recncilation" is nothing more than a euphemism for "teaching" the oppressed to "forgive and forget;" oh so rewarding and essential in today's society. Obviously, this book angered me 
 This book provides a lot of information for a person not familar with politics and natural resources.  Unfortunately, I do not think that this was the authors' intent.  For a person familar with this subject, the book just repeats ideas you probably are currently familiar with in a choppy fashion.  On top of this, the book seems biased with statements such as "traditional resource managemetn is pragmatic, seeing in nature a collection of resources that can be manipulated and harvested, with humans in control" while ecosystem management "views nature with some reverence and respect for the awsome complexity with which its components are interwoven."  Overall, the book is an easy read, but does not provide the reader with much thought or new ideas 
 It honestly pains me to write a plain review..  as it were, "damning by faint praise" I guess, however, I just felt very let down by Ms. Sutton's "Dancing in the Dark" album.  Though it is not terrible, nor hurtful to the ears, I couldn't help but feel very indifferent after listening to it a few times.  Ms. Sutton certainly has a musical gift, but nothing NEAR the level of Diana Krall or Stacey Kent, just to name a few.  Please excuse the layman's terms, but I will say this:  If you enjoy a very "voicy", drawn-out, sans instrumental style of jazz, then you perhaps would like this album.  If you prefer a jazz sound containing a more balanced mix of vocals and instruments (such as the afore mentioned Krall & Kent), then I would stay away from this album.  It really just boils down to a personal flavor I suppose.  Peace.  :- 
 The authors must certainly be experienced in building and the various trades but this book just didn't help me at all.  A total flop for me, really.  The book to get for the first time Owner-Builder is the Complete Guide to Contracting Your Home, by McGuerty & Lester.  A wonderful step-by-step guide with TONS of useful information 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word "community" is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  "We are all in this together," says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's "It Takes a Village."  The use of "community" is like the use of "opportunity" by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt 
 The Miami Sound Machine originally started out as a band that did their recordings in Spanish.    It would not be until the 1980s when the group would officially "crossover" into English Speaking albums.   Their first attempt at crossover was the 1984 album "Eyes of Innocence" that produced a song called "Dr. Beat" that gained some notoriety in Europe.    It would really be their 1986 follow-up album, "Primitive Love" that would propel the group, and most notably their lead singer Gloria Estefan to superstardom.    I can't say that I am a fan of the Miami Sound Machine or Gloria Estefan - because I'm not.  However, I do like a Latin influence in pop music, so I figured I would go deeper into this album and see if there was anything that would change my mind.   With a couple of exceptions,  there was little that changed my mind.  The overall problem I have with this album is that I really don't get a good sense for the Latin influence on this album.   Perhaps I am being hard on the Miami Sound Machine because it's quite possible that they didn't intend to make an English Speaking album with a Latin influence.    However, even if "Primitive Love" was an album done by a non-crossover artist, I think I would still be quite disappointed with this album.   I found this album to be reminiscent of early 80s pop with plenty of synthetic "early 80s" style music as a major element.  I also must admit that I am not a huge Gloria Estefan fan.   Today the term "Diva" is used to describe a great female vocalist.  While I do think Estefan does an admirable job on vocals, outside of a couple of songs ("Words Get in the Way" and "Surrender Paradise") - there really isn't much that makes me consider Estefan a true "Diva".  And while I'm still not a fan,  I think the argument can certainly be made that Estefan's later work may have put her into the "Diva" category.  It's just that I don't feel that this album contributes to help her elevate to that level.  I must admit, looking at the timeframe of the release of "Primitive Love", the success of this album really surprises me.   It was in the mid-1980s, that the pop music landscape was beginning to move to a more "natural" guitar-laden sound.   Many artists that recorded Synth-Pop songs in the mid 1980s soon began to struggle maintaining commercial success in this timeframe.  Yet, somehow the Miami Sound Machine did manage to succeed and overcome this.    The only reason I can think of is that CBS Records was smart in how they released the singles - they focused on the singles that did not seem to fit the early 1980s mold.  The song that propelled the Miami Sound Machine to pop stars would be the song "Conga".   When this was released as a single, I wasn't too impressed with this song.    Sometimes a song will grow on me the more I listen to it.   Unfortunately this was not the case with "Conga".   Yes this song has a Latin influence, but to me it really doesn't capture me.   I guess the bottom line is I feel that this is an overrated track.  As for the other singles that were released I actually found them much more enjoyable.   "Bad Boy" is probably my favorite of these tracks.   I wouldn't say that "Bad Boy" is a total Latin song.  In this song, I hear Latin elements mixed with some conventional pop elements.   I happen to like the way that the horns are used in this song.   I also think that that there is some creative use of percussion and guitar work in this song.   "Words Get in the Way" is one of the tracks where I do think Gloria Estefan's vocals dominate the song.  This is the one song on the album written by Gloria Estefan - and it's really well-written.  The song deals with a woman singing about the end of a long-term relationship.   This is a soft melody - not much of a Latin influence and it's really carried by the vocals.   Vocals also play a nice role on "Falling in Love".   This song has more of a conventional pop-feel.   On this particular song it isn't really Estefan's vocals, but some of the outstanding background vocal harmonies on the chorus that give this song a good feel.  The two worst songs on the collection happen to be the first two songs.   "Body to Body" is one of those songs that has an early 1980s feel.  However, it's not even a good early 80s song - it is very synthesizer-heavy and way overmixed.  I also didn't hear much of a Latin influence in that song.  While the next song, "Primitive Love" has a slight Latin influence, I still found this another song with an early 80s feel that was overmixed.   The bottom line is that the title-track isn't a very good song either.    There are some other songs with an early 80s feel that are better.  "Mucho Money" is also a song with an early 80s feel.   "Mucho Money" also does a better job at integrating the Latin influence with the 80s sound.  "Movies" is a song that has less of a Latin feel, but still maintains that 80s influence.    The chorus almost reminds me a bit of Dan Hartman's "Instant Replay". Next to "Bad Boy", perhaps the best track on this collection is "Surrender Paradise".   In a way, this song almost has more of a South Pacific feel to it.  Yes there is a Synthesizer element in this slow song, but this is one of the tracks whether Estefan's voice really shines.  I'm surprised this song didn't get more airplay - it is very good.  Overall, the poor early 80s style music and not the depth of the Latin influence were too much for me to overcome.  This album has its moments, but overall is a disappointing 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash 
 If you're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun--FISH! is the one I'd recommend.  In FUN Works, the author presents ELEVEN principles that are supposed to help us "understand the importance of the Fun/Work Fusion."  With eleven principles, this book is all over the place, and somehow misses the mark. I fervently believe that work should be FUN, but I didn't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way 
 I agree with other reviewers about positive points in this book, but what bothers me is the examples given : they all seem to be very special people : trainers, founders of training centers, vice-presidents of companies,.... This confirms obstacle 2 as given by the author : "only a few special people have true purpose in their lives".   I think we have a need for purpose in our lives, even if we are a gardener, a pizza boy, a cleaning lady, a sweatshop youngster sewing T-shirts in Laos, an office clerk doing standard routine work.  It is a pity that we find no such examples in this book.  From the book we get the impression that the only way to find a purpose is to quit our present job and to become a trainer, writer, etc...  but there are also other jobs to fill, I think.  Moreover, if everybody goes into training and/or writing, these jobs will loose their financial attractiveness, I suspect 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then.

 Good book. However,  it can be a lot better.   Pros:  Good recommendation on posing and lighting. He also talks about things you have to look for when shooting a wedding. He provides you a list of all the important shoots you must take for a wedding.   Cons: Today you may find this book out of date. He talks about film photography and shooting Polaroid's to make sure the image is in correct exposure.  There are some pictures that are great samples and other ones that are terrible and embarrassing to show it on a photo book. there are some recommendations that I don't I agree with. For example he recommends using 1000 ISO. if so, pictures will look grainy in film and high color noise in digital. He recommends no to shoot with flash at churches even if they let you use a flash. NO WAY!!.  His sample pictures looks grainy and terrible because he didn't use a flash.    The bottom line is:  Intermediate and professionals may want to avoid this one.  Beginners good to have it for posing recommendations, lighting, and a shooting list 
    Lets be honest, no one really likes this band. Its all bandwagon, afraid of appearing stupid and unadventurous nonsense. If tame punk with Geddy Lee(of Rush great band)meets Diamanda Galas(great singer and composer) vocals is your cup of tea then by all means pick this up. But please there is far too much interesting music out there to waste your time with this. Check out Ash Ra Tempel, Robbie Basho, Scratch Acid, Boris, Dalek, and Borbetomagus instead 
 At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.  While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven."  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.  Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2  
   The book is really old- getting close to a century- but some of the practical advice is sound.  Some of course is bereft of anything but historical value.  If you want a practical guide, you can find better 
 I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort.  I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I.  Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.  Take your time and read through the "cotton candy" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced 
 Teri Hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money.  But for her, and her ample body on ample display, this movie is just not worth the time.  Terrible direction, awful story, miserable music!! 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 I wore these slippers for about one week.  One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted.  I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper!  The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together.  Very disappointed 
 I was quite disappointed in this book. In a very "round about" way Virkler tells his readers that the Bible is to be interpreted personally, that is, no interpretation is wrong, and no interpretation is right, i.e., "to each his own." This type of new hermeneutic, though on the increase, decreases the authoritative nature of God's Word. 
 This is such a condesending book about "Middle America."   The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck 
 The idea of being able to spy on people, and history, via wormholes is an interesting idea. Seeing how people would deal with such an extreme loss of privacy is dealt with somewhat well.  As a whole, however, the book is little more than an interesting idea. The problem is the human element. The authors paid more attention to the way that the technology in the story is portrayed than the characters. As a result, none of the characters really pop out at you or seem very textured.  Also, with the various wormhole excursions into the past, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the authors would've been better off showing us these excursions rather than telling us about them. Those scenes come off with all the charm of a lab report.  If this book were a movie, I would say wait till it's broadcast on network television 
 I was looking forward to reading this book.  Made it almost through Chapter 2 and decided I was done.  This book is more about J.P. Craven than it is about the Cold War and the courageous and commendable service that was provided by the Navy's Silent Service.  If you want to know about how Craven saved the world, this is the book for you otherwise it is a great disappointment.  Recommend reading (or re-reading) Blind Man's Bluff before opening this autobiography 
 If you do buy this book save the receipt so that you can send it back if you are disappointed like I was. No respectable publisher would ever publish this book 
 Kasl does a good job of painting a broad picture which posits the pathway to spiritual enlightenment is broad and that there arwe many roads that can get us there.  Unfortuantely, too often she falls back on that pseudo-intellectual - new agey - warrior princess stuff that died out in the early 90s.  Her critique of AA and 12 step methodology is spot on in places, although she fails to acknowledge the diverse ways the 'program' is practiced by its membership.   Furthermore, issues of dogma, power and control are just as prevelant in feminist organizations as in AA.   One senses she's a bit blinded by her own loyalty to her postion.  Ultimately, its the excess of that 60s-postmodernist-femist tripe that kinda swamps the good parts of her message.  Definiately written for a different era.  Not sure how relevant it is to recovery/spiritual development these days.     
 I will admit that hands down case logic is THE BEST cd wallets you can buy.  They are (usually) constructed with great quality and you actually feel that you get your money's worth.  Even the protection it provides for the cd's that you put it in it is outstanding.  I'm a scratch freak and I've noticed that Case Logic wallets do not put any scratches what-so-ever on your cd's or dvd's.  Not even those little really light ones that you only see in bright light.  Nothing bad to say about them at all, it was pretty much everything a CD wallet should be, at it's finest.  BUT!, new this year is the redesigned version of these wallets and they are TERRIBLE!  The previous models were superior to any other cd wallet out there.  Now they have BROWN STITCHING put against black koskin leather.  The handle looks completely cheap and it comes from inside the wallet.  Letting you know that there is no telling what is holding it in place.  The mesh screen IN the handle is gone, so no more labels can be placed in it.  They are seriously terrible and that's all you can find when you go out shopping for one.  I found this out and quickly rushed to my favorite local electronic store and bought the last (previous model 320 koskin) cd wallet that I was lucky to find in the very back of the shelf.  The rest were the new UGLY and cheaply made ones at the SAME PRICE.  I bought that wallet just in case I needed it within the year and good thing I did, because I needed it, and now need another.  I'm now out of space and in desperate need for a new cd wallet, but I refuse to buy one of these new ones.  It doesn't matter if you get the koskin leather (which is my favorite) or the fabric ones, they are both repulsive in this years model.  So now I sit with old spool casings that used to hold all my blank cd's now holding my real cd's and dvd's until case logic comes back into focus and sells a better quality and improved (this time for real) cd wallet.  This is pretty much everything that the previous 2 reviews say.  I just COMPLETELY agree with everything they say and I'm hoping that somebody from case logic or word gets out to the people and they notice a huge slump in their sales this year.  Please Case Logic, no more brown stitching, poor quality handles and less features in your next model design of these wallets... my fingers are crossed 
 This movie is ridiculously inaccurate. Noah and his family get attacked by water pirates led by Lot who by the way wasn't alive till about 1000 years AFTER the flood. There's a water peddler as well-NOT IN THE BIBLE. Sodom and Gamorrah are destroyed which also doesn't happen for another 1000 years to which Lot has a big part. This "Lot" is a huge sinner, his wife is horrible and he has no daughters. God is portrayed as whimsical. Noah's son's aren't very godly either. It's inaccuracies and toying with the bible makes it worthy of kindling to start a fire. Don't bother watching it if you know the bible and love the Lord you will end up being disgusted too. Hollywood will do anything to ruin biblical movies. Stick to The Ten commandments, The Passion of the Christ, this one isn't worth 10 cents.. 
 Is it possible that Jesus could have been married and conceived children?  This is the question at the center of most of the controversy around The Woman With The Alabaster Jar, which provided the impetus for the Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Entire television documentaries have been devoted to examining the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. I will not spend too much time here trying to refute this outrageous claim, but a few points ought to be considered.  1. Mary Magdalene was not the woman with the alabaster jar! This was Mary of Bethany the sister of Lazarus. Right away, the so-called scholarship of Margaret Starbird is suspect. Has she even read the biblical texts? In the four canonical Gospels, several prominent woman are mentioned among Jesus' disciples. Mary of Bethany, the sister of Lazarus, is more prominent than Mary Magdalene. John chapter 11 tells the story of Lazarus who was raised from the dead by Jesus. In verse five we are told, "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus" (John 11:5). In all of the New Testament, Mary and Martha of Bethany are mentioned as the only women disciples whom Jesus loved. Mary of Bethany is also identified as the woman who "took a pound of  very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair" (John 12:3) in order to prepare Him for the crucifixion. One could just as easily concoct another conspiracy theory involving Mary of Bethany. Yet Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Da Vinci Code rely on a few obscure passages from the Gnostic Gospels to claim that it was Mary Magdalene who was loved by Jesus "more than all the disciples." And therefore, in a quantum leap of logic, Mary Magdalene must have been his wife.  2. Many of Jesus immediate family are mentioned in the New Testament. James and Jude, authors of the two general epistles were both called brothers of the Lord; John the Baptist was his cousin; John's parents were Elizabeth and Zechariah; and several of Jesus' siblings are mentioned as part of the so-called Holy Family. In Matthew 13:55,56, when Jesus teaches in his home country of Galilee, the people hearing him are astonished and ask: "Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?" (Matthew 13:55,56). It is unlikely that if so many immediate family members are mentioned in scripture, that someone as important as a wife would be left out.  3. One might counter that the Catholic Church wanted to cover-up evidence against the celibacy of Jesus, and decided to suppress the fact that Jesus was married. But if so, they also would have suppressed the the fact that Jesus had brothers and sisters since it contradicts the life-long celibacy of Mary, the mother of Jesus - another Roman Catholic teaching - one so universal in the history of the church, by the way, that it was also held by Protestants such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Zwingli and John Wesley. Yet the scripture mentioning Jesus' brothers and sisters was not removed from the text of the New Testament.  4. Eusebius, the fourth century church historian wrote that at the time of Jesus birth in the year 4 B.C.  ... there had been kept in the archives up to that time the genealogies of the Hebrews as well as of those who traced their lineage back to proselytes, such as Achior the Ammonite and Ruth the Moabitess, and to those who were mingled with the Israelites and came out of Egypt with them.  Eusebius goes on to mention that King Herod, and the first king of Judea not of Hebrew descent, had the genealogical records burned. But a few Jews, even in the time of Eusebius writing in the fourth century, had kept careful records of their lineage. He goes on to write that some of these were Christians who claimed lineage from the family of Jesus.  ... among these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni, on account of their connection with the family of the Savior. Coming from Nazara and Cochaba, villages of Judea, into other parts of the world, they drew the aforesaid genealogy from memory, and from the book of daily records as faithfully as possible.  Nowhere in Eusebius or in any other record up until this time, including the Gnostic writings, is there any mention of direct descendants of Jesus.  5. Finally, there is a bride of Christ mentioned in the book of Revelation. One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, came to me and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the Lambs wife (Revelation 21:9). John then sees in a vision the city of Jerusalem, a type of the church, coming down from heaven. While scripture promises that the victorious and risen Christ will one day wed a spotless bride in the form of spiritual Israel, the Church, Margaret Starbird imagines an earthly Jesus joined to a woman in the flesh. While Jesus did live on earth as a flesh and blood man, the marriage supper of the Lamb described in the book of Revelation tells us who the bride of Christ truly is 
 If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie 
 Up to now I haven't received the product that you've sent me for the second time.  Zuleid 
 Send is nothing but a commonplace guide on email that the marketing gurus had the audacity to compare to the "Elements of Style."  Each chapter is filled with obvious information on email: for example, "The Seven Big Reasons to Love Email" and "The Eight Reasons You May not Want to Email" are basic, skillfully written blogs of what we already know.  Another chapter dedicates 24 pages to the difference between "To" and "CC": again, more information that we know.  The most mind boggling chapter is titled, "How to Write [the Perfect] Email": a title that is undeniably deceitful.  This fruitless chapter uses the poor writing style of a preteen as an example. To add insult to injury, the quick overviews on why to incorporate grammar and punctuation, as well as avoid capital letters and odd fonts is so 90s.  Reviewing this book any further is a waste of valuable time and effort.  Congratulations Messrs. Shipley and Schwalbe for formatting a simple editorial into a $19.95 book. 
 I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books). I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you 
 Readers seeking to develop an understanding of the history and complexities of the  middle east conflict, with no investment in advancing the cause of either side, would be much better served by a more balanced presentation. While readable enough for this kind of thumbnail overview the author betrays his pedigree as a US-Israeli PR wonk throughout. The book is rife with unsupported statements casually tossed off as fact. Statements which may well be factually accurate but are so amateurishly presented that the credibility of the author's interpretation of events is done more harm than good. Uncited sources, unattributed facts and unconcealed bias in the language...what passes for scholarly work here is at best a useful timeline couched in a long-form pro-Israeli recruitment brochure. Reviewers claiming that any suggestion of bias is merely so much more anti-Zionist rhetoric should check their own axes for signs of grinding, then check out a better book on the subject. Producing a book that's easily readable needn't mean writing it poorly or without the substantiation and professional detachment that any respectable work of this nature demands. The target readers for this book may be "idiots", but they aren't dumb. The author trivializes the suffering of the Jews whose case he obviously supports and undermines his arguement by failing to give us credit for enough intelligence to draw our own conclusions without his subtle and not so subtle nudging.  Two stars if you simply want to spend half an hour skimming a what-happened-in-what-order sketch, zero if you're looking for substance, depth or well documented historical fact 
 The current vogue in historical fiction has led to an influx of novels such as The Ruby Ring.  Their authors take truly fascinating and moving artifacts and stories (in this case, the apparent affair between Renaissance artist Raphael and baker's daughter Margherita Luti) and then use them as the basis for a novel.  In some cases (such as Philippa Gregory's various novels about English history and Emma Donoghue's Slammerkin and Life Mask) the results are fascinating and inspired.  In other cases, such as The Ruby Ring, the results are dishwater-dull recoutings of what might have happened if everyone in history acted like they were in a romance novel.  I will discuss the plot of this novel, so don't read further if for some reason you fear having this book spoiled for you.  One sure sign you're reading a stinker is if the heroine is immediately presented as a paragon of wit, beauty, bravery and intelligence even though she is a mere girl of humble means. Often a parent (usually the father, in this case the mother) has impressed upon our lass that she is very special and cut out for great things.  And typically she has some kind of unusual eye color, for some reason, though in this case there's an actual painting so the author must lump it with the classic brown hue.  In any case, here's how this love story of the ages goes.  Raphael needs a new model, he seems Margharita, he immediately falls in love, after some ridiculous dillydallying on her part when offered what must have been the equivalent of 10K, easy, to pose for Raphael (I believe to show her feisty independence, even though her family is impoverished, so her hesitation seems to make no sense), she poses, they hit it, they fall in love.   From this point henceforth, which occurs early on, the vast majority of dialog between the two consists of "I love you, bella."  "I love you, mi amor."  (Sex ensues.)  This does not vary over the course of the rest of the book.     There are other characters, of course, particuarly a cardinal obsessed about having Raphael marry his daughter (who is ugly and weird, unlike super!pretty!and smart! and just as noble as the nobility!  Margharita.)  Most of them are pretty interchangeable.  Often they admire Margharita and think she is wonderful, unless one of them wants to marry/do Margharita or Raphael (handy!)    There is also much coverage of the politics of art and artists, none of which will be particularly interesting to most people who has read anything about Renaissance Italy before.  It seemed to me that the author was powering through those parts so she could get to the next "mi amor" scene.   The writing is dull too.  The author has a tendency to inform the reader of things that one could clearly pick up from context.  "Oh, Raphael, you signed the nudie painting of me!"  "Yes, mi amor, I am signing it because I am proud that I painted you in the altogether and you are my lady!"  "Oh, my dearest love, but you rarely sign paintings!"  "Oh yes, but as you can see, I did in this instance!  Now let us off to the bedchamber!"    Bleah.   
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 I liked this novel at the beginning.  The cast of characters was good.  As comic relief I thought Hannah Goldsmith was great -- and, speaking euphemistically, the tension about progress, or lack thereof, in her love life was of considerable interest.    What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.        Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books. I hope so.  But don't choose this one to read unless you are really, really a fan.      Smallchief    
 When will Disney ever learn that people could care less about Pan and Scan any more and that Widscreen editions are outselling 4:3 ratio by large margins. They could have at least provided both versions on one DVD. Top marks for this campy movie, zero stars for Disney 
 Being an engineer in the aerospace industry I was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I was . . .    This book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.   Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. These include:   - Manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.)   - High wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive.   - Americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates.   - There is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. Enron)    A scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book though. Instead you'll get:  A begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish.  A middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section.     A final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for "balance", should be listened to instead.   The worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound:  - A post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your lying eyes?"   - He rips into American post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers.   - The only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. When describing service industries "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs, "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling.   - Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. When the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.    - Gems of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)  - Americans are dumb and the only successful American companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get out of his own way.    - He always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!  - He claims Boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European" Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.   The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page.   All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that I could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American manufacturing in a globalized world. 
 Yes, free enterprise capitalism brings more economic benefits than socialism.  Reagan's tax cuts worked.  There is a great moral truth that people should retain their earnings rather than fork them over to the state bureaucracy.  Yet, the Reagan boom did not lift all boats.  The mediocre and the inept slipped backward in the 80s just as they have during the Clinton boom of the 90s.  The rise of the two wage-earner family, much of it forced on mothers due to economic circumstances (continued high taxes, the collapse of high wage, semi-skilled jobs) is a shame which neither Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative have really attempted to tackle.  The press release, prevelant during the Clinton and Reagan booms, of "We've created ___ million jobs in __ years" is a lazy, stupid, dishonest sort of boast. The families of America would be better off with fewer but better paid jobs rather than a bunch of $8/hr. jobs. The New Class, either conservative or liberal, does not seem to understand it.  Mr. Bartley does not understand 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.  
 Do not even waste your time getting this. First of all it's very diffucult to get it to the proper consistency, not too watery that is slips off the spoon and not too thick or it won't go down her throat. Even my daughter thought it wasn't worth the hassell and said "let's just pretend". If you are lucky enough to get the right consistency and it actually comes out the other end (sitting her on the potty is another story), it takes a long time to all come out and then it's a pain to clean it up. Don't do it, I'm telling you 
 I read some of the reviews about this book present on this site and was somewhat surprised to see mostly positive ones. Maybe it is just my perception or the expectation I had after reading these reviews but before buying the book that lead to my disappointment in the book. What were my expectations...? I did expect Galen to tell me what he thinks and feels before, during, and after taking those great pictures. I did NOT expect a HOW-TO book (which it is definitely not). I expected a book about artistic approach to the outdoor photography. What I found instead was mostly a travel log. The first 2 chapters were as close to my expectation as it ever got. The author talked some about his creative approach and very little about his technical one. The rest of the book doesn't even present his "photographic philosophy". He simply talks about his travels, places he visited, people he met. All that would be great for an illustrated travel book but not for a book that was supposed to tell me about how HE came to those pictures, what (in his opinion) made those pictures great or standing out (there is some of it but so little it almost doesn't exist). The book's title has "inner game" words in it. I wanted to know what that "inner" game was before, during, and after taking EACH picture (or at least most of them). Overall - disappointing and expensive for that 
 I had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample.  It is a lovely magazine, beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about "other coasts" (besides east and west).  But, at least with the most recent issue, in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian.  Even the advertisements had only white people (save for one about vacationing in Mexico that had some cute Mexican children in it).  While I doubt this is intentional, I would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue.  There are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about 
 There is a version available at Amazon translated by Nicola Luckhurst.  It is excellent, although almost any version would be preferable to Strachey's mechanistic translations of Freud's work.  STUDIES IN HYSTERIA is a seminal study for both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.  It was written by Freud and Breuer.  A long-standing but unfounded lie first told by Freud and passed on by Ernest Jones blames Breuer for abandoning "Anna O"--Bertha Pappenheim, the first analytic patient--because he couldn't handle her falling for him, but in truth he treated her long after the supposed cure he reports here.  A case could be made for Breuer and Pappenheim being the actual originators of psychotherapy as a modern healing method 
 *PLOT REVEALED*  An utterly worthless foray into English overbearance and haughtiness, this film marks Hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment' in the pre-War 1930's.  Working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in London to indoctrinate subordinate English audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of Germany, Hitchcock eases the tension by making this a "comedy".    Wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness (the scene at an Austrian Hotel where the boring Brits are talking about Cricket and drinking tea), he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations, the fight scene in the baggage cart for example.    His support for the upper Brit classes is especially drab and tedious, meandering between hero worship and idolatry, not to mention the wooden acting of the actors.  The story concerns a "secretive plot" about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the Austrian Alps, simplistic, innocuous even but Hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn't want to think she imagined it all.  Of course, she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men'.  Immature plot?  Definately.  Banter, insipid and devoid of any vivacity, is exchanged between high brow English snobs in the most elusive way, bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train.  This is nourishment for those who can't think very well.  The story continues until the stuffy, pretentious, oaf-like English on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema, the Brits, debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper English, sit there in front of open windows, with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes.  Also in this scene, the 80 year old woman "spy", jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily, how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate, or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off.  If you can believe in the superiority of British snobs, then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film.    Of course you can guess the ending, the woman falls in love with the English chap who helped her on the train, and England is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact, an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930's but most audiences will take this as merely a "thriller" instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda.  
 Perhaps this collection of sounds might be an interesting experiment in what you can get the public to buy, but it certainly isn't music. Some might call this progressive or some other term to denote a lack of musical ability, which presumes that only those of great artistic sensibility can really appreciate the work; I call it worthless 
 ...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.  But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.  One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!  I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye 
 I am a big Dawn fan, so I miss Dawn.They could've replaced Dawn with someone better than Abby. Abby is an obnoxious eigth grader who thinks she is so funny. Abby shows of that she is so cool. In the book she tries to help her mom and sister ajust to Stoneybrook. Abby should have never joined the club. Kristy is right when she says that Abby is a bad baby-sitter. Abby should have never joined the club 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 If you're looking for a clear, easy to understand work, this is not for you. It seems the author fluctuates between writing for a population that is well versed in statistical understanding, to one that is just learning concepts and terms. The reader ends up being tossed around with too much information at times, and at other times too little information. There are many, many better works on these topics 
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 I have heard many performances of Also Sprach over the years and this '74 Karajan has never impressed me as anything other than a superficial audio demo to test system dynamic range. As a performance the homogenised cushion of string tone that became such a fetish of Karajan serves to rob the music of most inner textural detail rendering a lifeless and flat musical result. Recently I closely compared the two Reiner/Chicago recordings to see how much difference there was, and included Karajan's 1959 Vienna Phil. as well as this recording for comparison. There was not the slightest doubt that the '74 Deutsche version came last. Karajan's earlier Decca recording is markedly superior - so much more of Strauss' orchestration can be heard, giving the music far greater power and vibrancy. Reiner's '54 (stereo) version is slightly better than the later '62, which is on a par with the VPO Karajan - but this '74 BPO is not in the running. Karl Böhm recorded a better version with the same orchestra, not to mention others that also outclass this DG Karajan. 
  I really do not understand all the fuss about this range,  I can only assume that because these rather silly pots and pans have a french name that people somehow equate that with cuisine quality. I received a casserole as a gift, which was lovely, they look good and have a snob value and cache.   But they are truly awful! they dry out food too quickly, they are pure evil to try and clean and they are ridiculously heavy! you could give yourself a hernia hauling one out of the oven.  My advice is forget the hype and stay practical in the kitchen! Incidently, mine is used as heavy and special occassion only, tureen; a lot of money to shell out for a not very practical serving dish 
 I did not order this Item.  My order was for "Shoes of the Fisherman" 
 I also think that this book is too full of academic theory and techniques, and this may be the reason it comes off as so cynical.  It works best in providing factual background that would be difficult to find otherwise.  But when the book shades into critique, the tone becomes dry and pre-occupied, if not positively dispiriting -  particularly when the co-authors subject Tarkovsky to their brand of Freudian analysis.  The result is a disjointed collection of facts and vexing speculations, which on balance does a disservice to the poetry of the films.  I personally much prefer Maya Turovskaya's book, which doesn't have the encyclopedic range of facts one finds in "Fugue" (a friend of mine described "Fugue's" method as "trainspotting") but is a far more inspired and illuminating combination of intelligent insight and love of its subject 
 I seem to be in a minority here, but I disliked this book so much I didn't even finish it. It now resides at the bottom of my trash can.  Don't get me wrong, I'm somewhat of a "born-again Taoist." The Lao-Tzu saved my life, and between that and Thomas Merton's "The Way of Chuang-Tzu," my entire life philosophy and outlook has shifted radically. The hard part is conveying the reasons for my distaste of this book. It may be because the only real redeeming parts are those directly copied from the Lao and Chuang Tzu. It may be because, after reading Merton's explaination of the "three in the morning" analogy, I cannot agree with A.C. Graham's translation, both in feeling and in words. Far, far too literal and intellectual. Taoism is, for me, about not trying to understand things, but rather letting them be.  If you are a scholar and writing papers or such, it might be good for you. For the spiritual seeker, if you need more Taoist thought, I would recommened reading different translations of the Lao-Tzu or Chuang-Tzu. It's really all you need

 With this volume Bryan Ward-Perkins seeks to dispel the myth that the end of the Roman Empire and the subsequent rise to prominence in Western Europe of the Barbarians was a relatively peaceful transition, without a large level of violence, or even major disruption. In this area he is successful, however this does not change my opinion that this is, overall, a weak book.  Ward-Perkins begins by discussing how recent works discussing the Fall of Rome and the Rise of the Barbarian West have dispelled the notion that this transformation was violent, or largely disruptive. IMO this is one of his weakest arguments. I have read dozens of books discussing this era and in none of these have I seen anything to support his claim that this is the current trend in the field. All works I have read speak of death, enslavement, destruction, the sack of cities, the displacement of thousands of people, etc. These works have taken differing views on whether this was a good or bad thing, or whether it was necessary, or, above all, just what it was that caused the end of the Western Empire, but in none of these have I read an argument put forward that the period was relatively painless. One text which he specifically takes exception to is Peter Brown's "The World of Late Antiquity" (1971). While I have not read this, I do have Brown's "The Rise of Western Christendom" (1996). In it, I do not see an argument for a peaceful transformation. While one may argue over his characterization of conflicts as being generally small and localized rather than large-scale in nature, Brown refers to the "end of Roman Peace" p 56 and the "grim glimpse of the human cost" p 78.  In addition, Ward-Perkins is given to over-exaggeration. Nowhere is this more evident than in his assertion that the Post-Roman West had fallen to a level of economic prosperity "back to a standard of living typical of prehistoric times." p 183 or that "It took centuries for people in the former empire to reacquire the skills and the regional networks that would take them back to these pre-Roman levels of sophistication." p 137  I certainly have no argument with anyone who says that overall standards of living, levels of trade, cultural sophistication and complexity, etc., fell and fell radically following the end of the Roman Empire in the West. But to argue that these fell to below pre-Roman levels over anything close to the entire region is beyond belief, particularly when these assertions are not supported. Ward-Perkins appears to ignore the Visigothic taxation system established by Euric in Spain and Southern Gaul immediately following its seccession from the Empire, or that evidence exists for a vigorous (if less extensive) maritime trade continuing throughout the Mediterranean. He himself states that "Once the violence was over, in large parts of the former western empire a great deal of the social structure, and much of the administrative and cultural framework of imperial times, re-emerged and flourished." p 63 I do not see how this statement can be reconciled with an argument for society to have fallen below pre-Roman standards. Certainly this may be argued for small areas, or for brief periods of time, and I would hesitate even to argue against him for the whole of Britain. But overall, this outlook is insupportable.  I will not say that this book is without worth. For much of it, I found myself agreeing with Ward-Perkins, only to revert back to the thought, "Who is arguing anything else?" In particular, his discussion of pottery and what archaeological evidence can reveal is very instructive. To his credit, Ward-Perkins admits to being "conditioned by a very 'Roman' upbringing and early experience" p 169. I believe that while much of what he says is supportable, much is overblown. If there are works extant that argue for a relatively pain-free ending to the Roman Empire (rather than simply utilizing terminology which Ward-Perkins disagrees with), these are certainly misrepresentations of the evidence, however this is no reason to provide a work which misrepresents matters in the opposite direction.  Ultimately, this reads more as a 200-page editorial than a scholarly historical work. I would not argue against someone purchasing it, but if you do, please purchase other companion volume or volumes covering the same period to help provide a more balanced view 
 It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.   Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.   A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.   No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy 
 This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.   If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society

 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 I am very disappointed in this book.  I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks.  Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine.  He said never to use the "V-shape" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book.  The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place.  My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists.  I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines.  It was not.  
      WOW !        This can only be described as Dyke-lit.....Deranged Dyke-lit.       WOW !!!       Mary Daly is nothing short of a feminist version of Louis Farrakhan, only that Daly is far more extreme than that.         This is a 417 page raging screed of man hate. It's unreadable drivel. Daly dissects words, and turns them inside out to form linguistic bludgeons. A little of that can be taken as entertaining, and at least somewhat factual, or at least plausibly factual. 400+ pages of it....???  It leaves me thinking of the kook in front of my local Post Office who keeps trying to run for President. He rants complete nonsense too, he just hasn't written it down, and had it published.        As a man I find this to be not the least bit threatening. You can't even take this stuff seriously. "Gynocide" .... hun???  "Gynocide" ????  This chick has such a gyno-centric view of the world she doesn't have the faintest clue as to what makes men tick.     It's a travesty to give this thing even one star.        
 I am very disappointed with the Peek a Boo Jack in the box.  The blue plastic latch that keeps the Jack in the Box in the Box will not latch.  I would not recommend buying it 
 I was expecting a "kit" based on the title.  It turned out to be a 210 page paper-back book. The main reason I bought the "kit" was to get sample contracts, but none were included.  He does a decent job  of describing the basic process, and good ideas on marketing. Overall, I'd  look for a better source if you're planning to FSBO your home 
 If you think that Eastern style is all about Japanese style and minimalism then this is the book for you.  But if you think Asia includes India, Thailand, Burma, Bali, Korea etc, you will find this book and its aesthetic a huge disappointment.  I did.  Stick with Kelly Hoppen 
 not a good soundtrack at all.   I don't even remember the songs on it cause they weren't good and I only listened to it once.  The best part,  the score,  is not on the soundtrack.   But, I recently tracked that down on a CD by John Taylor called Metafour  (not available on Amazon for some reason).   Get that if you liked the movi 
 "Journey to the Land of No" is a first-person memoir of a Jewish girl growing up in Iran during the Revolution.  The book describes what her life and the life of her family was like before and after this cataclysmic event.  Having developed an unaccountable interest in the Iranian Revolution during the past year, I have read perhaps a dozen books about this subject.  Hakakian's book, while not bad, would have to be toward the bottom of the list of books you should read about this subject.  It just didn't grab me.  And certainly there has been no shortage of books written by women who lived in Iran during the Revolution and have since escaped.  But if you're only going to read one or two, there is much better fare out there.  "Reading Lolita in Tehran" is searing and unforgettable, and the graphic novel "Persepolis" is simply excoriating.  This latter would be at the top of said list.  Yeah, the competition is pretty stiff these days.  The bar for writing an "I'm an Iranian exile and here's why"-type book has been set incredibly high by so much good stuff out there now, and Hakakian's effort doesn't quite measure up.  Anyhow.  Compared to harrowing books like those, Hakakian's story is -- dare I say it? -- ho-hum.  Occasionally it is tenderly written, but I left the book feeling that she had little to say, and because, at least compared to other authors writing about the same subject, little remarkable happened to her.  What is most regrettable about the book, I suppose, is that Hakakian's Jewishness is almost incidental to her tale.  This is sad.  She certainly mentions that she was Jewish, and this does form the cornerstone for a few events in the story, but basically what happens to her and her family could have happened to pretty much any Iranian during that time.  And this is regrettable because the Jewish angle was the one really original thing this book had going for it.  And the author, I must aver, failed to really explore it or make it come alive.  In fact, so forgettable is the whole outing that, a few weeks after having read this book, I am unable to recall a single incident from it 
 I just received this CD in the mail.  It is TERRIBLE!!!  It almost sounds "tinny."  Like it was coming through a $6.00 radio.  There is a lot of background noise like a record has and there is almost no bass.  I gave it 1 star because it is the Blues Brothers and there are some great songs on it.  I also have the original soundtrack ordered.  I certainly hope it sounds better 
 I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then.   He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"  "you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"  In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage 
 They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Jill Clayburgh as Barbara Jane Bookman? haw haw haw OK, that is the only thing that is funny about this prolific disaster from the 70's.  Dan Jenkin's hilarious off-the-wall tribute to the NFL and Billy Clyde's diary of the road to the Super Bowl is replaced by an introspective look at self-improvement fads and Gene Autrey music.  You know, an adaptation of a book is one thing and one shouldn't generally get their hopes up that the film will match the story contained in any novel. However, this thing is not an adaptation, bears no resemblence whatsoever to the novel, and only the title and a few characters however retooled they may be remain. Pitiful. 1 Stetson 
 If you can possibly avoid it, don't buy this book.  If you can't possibly avoid it, remember to use the internet.  The internet is 3000 times better at things than this book is.  Also, realize that even the problems in this book have continuous typos so if your TA grades you as wrong, check to make sure you are doing the same problem their solution book solved.  I wish we could rate this book without a star 
 I wish I could have back the numerous tedious hours slogging through White Noise to the bitter, bitter end.  Not since Jane Smiley's Moo has such a dull tome been written aobut, among other things, Ameican academia.  Little happens of note.  No one cares about the cardboard characters.  Someone gets shot in the belly, for no good reason.  And yet this is fawnedover as a comic masterpiece by, among others, The New York Times.  I ahve been told to read White Noise before I picked up Underworld.  Have no fear.  I'll undergo root canal without Novocain before I try that one on for size.  I've been reading nothing but plumber's trade journals and German magazines just to try to get the taste of this novel out of my mouth for the past few days.  I'm thinking of getting the definitive Curious George collection just so I don't have to read any words.  At least that guy in the big yellow hat knew enough to keep his mouth shut, unlike that noncompoop Jack Gladney and his boring friends.  If people prersist in thinking this is great literature, I suggest giving up reading altogether.  
 It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.  In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point 
 This book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics, etc. To me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.  Admittedly, I could not even finish this book; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky, circumstantial evidence like "all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw, but there are no correction marks, therefore optics must have been used," I could not even stand to keep reading! On the contrary, all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult, after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature, and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction.  That is just one example... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - Hockney claiming "this is too good to have been done without optics" or "this was too difficult to have been done without optics" - and I found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art, if that is indeed what he thinks. And, modern artists must remember this: nowadays, the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists, for many reasons. Superior art education is very hard to find, and there are many distractions in the modern world (TV, computers, having to hold a 'day job', lack of patrons, etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did. Therefore, most will never attain the skill of the old masters. But that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology!  Some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion, perspective, etc. in otherwise masterful work. I am surprised that this author (and those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that throughout history, great artists did NOT necessarily strive for EXACT realism - even nowadays, photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists, because after all we are ARTISTS not cameras! The point of realist art is to ACCENTUATE the reality, not to copy it! Therefore, many inconsistencies in proportion, perspective, etc. evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes', but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition.   All that being said, I think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist, since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. Instead, an art student should be encouraged to build skill, discipline, and self-reliance - because THAT is the true secret of the great masters 
 Mr Gonick set the bar very high with his 'Cartoon History of the Universe'.  This book is terrible by comparison. The art work is primitive at best, and his biased perception of American history borders on the comical. Unfortunately, that is the funniest part of the book 
 only heats the palm of your hand, fingers stay cold. No elements in the fingers of the glove, only heating element is in the palm of your hand.  Not worth the money, 
 ...what happened to this? Wurthering Heights has been my favorite book for a long time and I was really looking forward to seein this. I was really disappointed. It is clear that Bronte's sharp, disturbing novel was dumbed down to be less shocking to the minds of the time. The passion, jelousy and generation spanning revenge is gone from this film adaptation (as is the eventual redemtion of the Ernshaw-Linton families, because the whole second half of the book has been left out!). Passionate and slightly evil Cathy has been reduced to a bratty damsel in distress, and because of the film making techniques of the time the breathtaking Yorkshire countryside isn't utilized. That being said, the movie isn't all bad. Sir Laurance is incrediable here, a redeeming part of the movie. And if you've never read/ don't feel passionately about the book this could be a nice, if slightly ordinary, love story. Basically, this is a good enough adaptation for the time it was made, but it makes a firery book afully bland. For a better (great in my opinion, if a slightly flawed masterpiece) see the 1992 version of this film 
   The story is even less imaginative than the writing. The kind of book you write when you have nothing real to say 
 The "bottom-line" on "Brainless" is that one has to be "brainless" to take time to read Coulter's writings, and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them.    Yes, it is mildly interesting to learn of Coulter contradictions (eg. bashes the elite, then takes on Harriet Miers - partly because she didn't go to an elite law school, and "I believe everything I say," vs. "Most of what I say, I say to amuse myself and amuse my friends."  And then there are the infinite number of brainless "Coulterisms" and unsupported assertions - eg. "public schools have more sex scandals per year than Catholic priests - thirty times more," "Liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos," "I've never seen people enjoying their (9/11) husbands' deaths so much."  On the other hand, Maguire really doesn't have that much to say that IS INTERESTING!  On the other hand, if you hadn't figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with Ann Coulter - this book won't help.  Save your money and your time 
 I am a staunch supporter of young film makers, and love a good "coming-out" story; however, trainwreck as another viewer called this, doesn't even begin to describe how bad this film is.  I've seen better high school and community theater productions! The acting--particulary the mother and step-father sounded as though it was being read for the very first time.  With the right cast, the script might have had half a chance, but even that's questionable with same old tired gay cliches and predictable stereotypes 
 This is the first Moore book I have read. I thought it was ok. The story was pretty original and somewhat entertaining, but I just don't share his sense of humor. I love dark, bizarre humor, and that's what brought me to this book. My favorite author is Chuck Palahniuk, who, as many of you probably know, has an extremely dark and twisted sense of humor. I just didn't think that this book was all that funny. I admit, it did have its moments. There were times that I laughed pretty hard at this book, but these moments were few and far between. I saw many moments where this book was trying to be funny, it just seemed to me like Moore was trying too hard. I would be willing to try reading a Moore book again, but from what I could tell from this book, you need a very specific sense of humor to really enjoy this him. It is dark, but I thought it could be really corny and dumb at times too 
 This was, by far, the most disappointing novel I have read by Bharti Kirchner.  It was contrived, stereotypical and sappy.  Though, the plot idea was intriguing--a seven year old Indian girl is married off to her best friend, is then separated from her groom, her mother is brutally beaten and she ends up adopted by a white, America couple--it didn't hold together.    One of the biggest flaws in the book was the stereotypical depiction of the characters.  The worst is of Carlos, the main character, Meena's, good friend.  Though he is from Mexico, he teaches her samba (from Brazil), Kirchner misspells his hometown of Oaxaca (she spells it Oxaca).  He is macho and womanizing, and seemingly mindless.  Also, Bharti's writing style seems half-baked and almost condescending to her readers.  Kirchner ties up the complications a little too readily and unbelievably.   If you would like to read a far superior novel by Kirchner, my reccomendation is that you read "Sharmila's Book," which is also about a young Indian woman's bicultural sense of self.  Far more interesting, compelling and well written 
 I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days.   I'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money, time and effort. 
 Like a few of the other reviewers, I was going along, enjoying the book when that god-awful epilogue came along and ruined the whole thing.   I can't, for the life of me, figure out what the author was thinking with that?  What was the point?  It seemed so utterly bizarre, I was completely perplexed by it.    I'm a sucker for a character study, and this did a so-so job of that.  I enjoyed the author's language.  The plot was okay.  Altogether, I probably would have given the book 4 stars, but really, that epilogue just blew it.  I'm disappointed that Ms. Patchett had to create a "hollywood ending" for this book.  Somebody just had to live happily ever after, otherwise its not a good story, right?  I'm disappointed that we can't let a tragic story be a tragic story, especially when the story tries to tie itself to opera, which is the epitome of tragic story.  Skip the epilogue.  Really.  Go back to it after a few weeks if you really must read it, but don't read it while you are still feeling a connection to the characters.  The epilogue will completely ruin it for you 
 Mr. Patterson: Please demonstrate more discretion in selecting ghost writers for your pulp fiction publishing machine.  Ms. Paetro: Don't quit your day job.  If you are looking for character development, descriptive scenes, engaging voice and style, believable conflict, romantic or who-done-it suspense, balanced point of view, entertaining pace, and (or) suspension of disbelief, this is not a book deserving of your time or money.  If your idea of pacing is 146 chapters spread across 400 pages, or if the lame pet dog character foil trick works for you, be sure to buy this book at Amazon's used book prices 
 Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10" x 10", that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible. Also, I'm not sure I like the pronunciation of the speaking feature: "pec-tor-AY-lis major"? If you have the cash to spare, it makes a nice toy, but it is not worth the price 
 The non-functioning illuminating speckles on Illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions. If you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing, go for it. If you're paying more, you're wasting your money 
 I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.  
 I agree with a previous reviewer and thank him for recommending La Varenne Pratique by Anne Willan as an alternative to this book. La Varenne is a beautifully photographed, well-organized book that truly is a book of cooking techniques. This book is much more a collection of esoteric recipes for fancy, specialized french cuisine.   The worst thing about this book is that there are no headings on the pages so you can't tell what section you're in as you move through the book and the bottom footer only says "Technique seventy-eight"--how is that helpful? The book almost seems like it was cut off at the top and bottom to make it smaller for printing. It reminds me of the self-published photocopied books from the early days of desk-top publishing. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but compared to La Varenne Pratique by Anne Willan it is inferior....unless you are interested in boning various cuts of meat and fish and then cooking them in aspic or in puff pastry, or turning vegetables into fried potato balls, zucchini puff paste, etc.   If you want to know how to select, prepare, serve and store everything from vegetables and fruits to seafood and meat I recommend La Varenne Pratique instead. If you want to open your own fancy French restaurant then maybe buy this book too! 
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 This book came to me highly recommended, and I really wanted to like it.  I just didn't much, however.  The plot idea, the killing of a twin, and then the other twin taking over her life, sounded like an interesting mystery idea.  But in reality, the characters seemed really 2 dimensional -- totally unbelievable.  This might be a good summer holiday book, however, if you don't expect too much.  I would like to read some other items by this author -- there is potential for a good mystery writer 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.   The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!  There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.  The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst. 
 I absolutely love Oklahoma - one of my all-time favorites! Too bad the display is reduced to a thin 6" wide ribbon, leaving 2/3 of the screen blank. I'd really like to see product descriptions indicate the viewing size, or lack thereof! There's no way I'd purchase a mini-screen marvel if I knew better 
 McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry) 
 I love the Redsox and have since I can remember, but I had trouble finishing this book.  So we get a diary from the perspective of two diehard fans.  All this does is remind me of what I was thinking during the season before/during/after certain games, but it never provided me with an interesting tidbits.  As for the perspective of a true "diehard" fan, O'Nan acts like an imbecile.  I can imagine him out at the game forcing his way past kids to get balls during batting practice.  Wow, that sure is fun to read about!!!!  And his obsession with his fishing net is scary as well.  He comes across as a whiny kid in an adult body that has fun bragging that he had an "in" during the season.  He provided nothing to the enjoyment of this book.  King was better, and because his mind seems to work differently than the average person, it was fun to see his perspective on certain events.  Some of his passages are the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.  I would suggest that if you followed the season closely either through reading the Globe or Herald, or listened to Boston sports radio, you will get nothing out of this book.  If on the other hand you were caught up in the euphoria of the postseason and want to know some of the feelings Redsox fans went through during the season, you might enjoy some of the book.  Now can I direct my book royalties so that O'Nan doesn't get anything 
 I purchased a Cookshack smoker over 5 years ago and have experimented with it off and on.  While I realize that barbeque is more art than science, I have been frustrated by the lack of information on just how much wood to use with particular recipes.  I pre-ordered this book in anticipation of learning some secrets and tricks in the use of the Cookshack smoker.  I waited for more than a month for delivery of the book and upon receipt of it, I eagerly delved into it looking for answers to my many questions.      To my great disappointment, this book offered absolutely no information that I hadn't learned from trial and error.  How much wood should I use?  The book suggests that I consult the Cookshack Operator's Manual.  There are some general guidelines but the guidelines don't tell you what amount of wood works best with what amount of food.  Although I have had some delicious food from the Cookshack, if I am cooking for guests, I use my Brinkmann smoker as I am more confident that the food will be cooked to perfection.  The water smoker takes longer, but is more forgiving than the sealed, dry smoking Cookshack.       People who like to smoke fish will find 48 pages of recipes.  If you prefer beef or pork, the list is much smaller, 16 and 15 pages respectively.  There are also small sections dedicated to sausages, lamb and game.      In short, this is a book that should have been a digest for Cookshack owners and prospective buyers.  At best, it is a generic guide for smoking recipes.  It doesn't promote the product line and it isn't a worthwhile choice for anyone new to smoking foods 
 There has been a lot of fascinating research recently about the biology of transcendence.  But you won't find it in this book.  What you will get is a personal reconciliation of his Christianity.  Not that that's bad--but it is not how the book is represented.  A fundamental problem with this book is one that bedevils (so to speak) many works by authors who write on subjects outside of their field of expertise.  Pearce is a theologian (apparently).  He is not a physician, physiologist, biologist, or anthropologist--and this really shows when he writes about those subjects.  The theology is OK.  The physiology is ho-hum--the same any intro course would give--except that he strays into details that are unfounded or absurd.  As for the anthropology--whew! where does he get this stuff?  Ancient cities from 20,000 years ago?!  Early Americans that were 7 ft tall?!!  This the stuff of fantasy and unfortunately really discredits his attempt to study the phenomenon of transcendence.  
 Just another really expensive textbook with no real information provided. The Better Homes and Garden series has much more how-to information, great photographs, and ten percent  of the cost too 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 Michael Hirsh's "At War With Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World" is a though-provoking argument for increased American involvement in world affairs.  However, rather than pursuing the unilateral policy that the current administration favors, Hirsh insists that America should become more active in what he refers to as "the international community."  He maintains that only through more active participation in the international community can America continue as the "berpower" of the modern world.  Hirsh's primary claim in "At War With Ourselves" seems to be that if America were more involved in the international system, the world would see us as its protector and ally rather than its enemy.  He asserts that America has an obligation to the international community because this community itself is of America's own making.  He also devotes much of the book to the hypocrisy of America's foreign policy: he claims that while we advocate widespread democracy, we shy away from the implementation of this policy if it does not suit our purposes. Hirsh is a good writer, with a style that is easy to read and easy to follow, but he has one flaw-many of his arguments are simply weak and contradictory.  He excels at including data and facts-but only those that suit his purpose, leaving out the other side of the argument.  Or worse: he often seems to be "at war with himself," arguing one side of an issue in one chapter, only contradict himself in a later one 
 The music on this CD was not very good. The renditions of YEA, ALABAMA and BOOMER SOONER were played at too slow of a tempo. The AGGIE WAR HYMN was totally butchered at the end. Another thing wrong with this CD the omission of the MINNESOTA ROUSER and the SEMINOLE WAR CHANT. The renditions of ACROSS THE FIELD, NOTRE DAME VICTORY MARCH and FIGHT ON, USC were the best on this CD 
 This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!! 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I have a slightly older copy and I have found that for the PE exam this is a good reference however, if you are doing something in the real world, the Machinery's Handbook is FAR better.  This book gives good overviews of a huge variety of topics that any Mech Engr might need but not much depth.  It is about as much information as a manager might want to know 
 This review is for Cremaster 4 & 5, although I can't imagine that 3 would be any better...  Cremaster 4 (and 5) might have been tolerable if the running time had been cut in half.  Let's just say that this "film" wore out it's welcome very quickly.  All one has to do is watch the "trailer" on Barney's website to get the point.  There is art, and then there is crap.  Cremaster is pure, unfiltered garbage.  References to human reproduction (genitals, sperm and ovum) aside - this non-feast for the eyes was pompous, annoying, and the intentional grossness is demonstrated through the use of excessive slime, Vaseline, and globs of mucous encased gonads.  Cremaster 5 has a higher production value, but is equally uninteresting, laborious, and tiresome.  I can appreciate the absurdity behind the work of artists such as Damien Hirst - the dark humor and wit, a connection to substance abuse and death - the darker side of life that many can relate to and others can appreciate.  Barney makes a living out of creating "art" that seemingly has no connection to anything of value.  A pretentious load of bull.  But then again, he did go to Yale 
 For Plutarch diehards.  Other than Lycurgus, the few Lives covered are all relatively obscure Spartan kings of the Hellenic period.  Half the book is comprised of Spartan "sayings" which are very tedious 
 The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).  The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....    Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)  As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...  I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments 
 I heard the author on the radio recently, and he came off as a total ignoramus. He subscribes to the belief that seems to be popular amongst conservatives these days that any lame-brained crackpot with an axe to grind should be taken seriously when it comes to science. During his interview, he spent most of his time evading the questions directed at him and distancing himself from the inflammatory BS printed all over the dust jacket of his book (of the "this book is the antidote to the evil liberal conspiracy" variety), prompting one of the other guests on the program to ask him if he was at war with his publisher. He apparently supports every looney conservative-backed pseudoscience you can imagine, including AIDS denial, "intelligent design," global warming skepticism, and a misunderstanding of hormesis that seems to equate it with homeopathy. I was not surprised to find that this book was published by Regnery, well known as a factory for right wing garbage.   We live in a time when proper understanding of scientific issues has never been more important, and yet our political leaders and the people who vote them into office are woefully uninformed and confused when it comes to science. A book like this only compounds the problem. Bethell and Regnery should be ashamed of putting out deliberate misinformation to turn a quick buck 
 This is a hit or miss product. I ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. My extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. I would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. I adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. If you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them. 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 (1) P. Diddy feat. Ginuwine, Loon, Mario Winans & Tammy Ruggieri "I Need A Girl Part II" B+ Good, but I liked part one better.  (2) Nelly "#1" C- Too old and annoying.  (3) Ja Rule, Ashanti, Charli Baltimore & Vita "Down 4 U" B+ Good, but have seen much better from Ashanti.  (4) Cam'ron feat. Juelz Santana "Oh Boy" F I hate this song!  (5) Scarface feat. Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel "Guess Who's Back" F I hate this song too!  (6) Busta Rhymes feat. P. Diddy & Pharrell "Pass Courvoisier" (REMIX) F Annoying! AAAAHHHH!   (7) Beanie Sigel & Freeway "Roc The Mic" F WILL IT EVER END?  (8) Eminem "Without Me" A+ It's about time for a good song! Actually, this one is groundbreaking.  (9) Big Tymers "Still Fly" D+ Very overrated and irritating.  (10) Fat Joe feat. Ja Rule & Ashanti "What's Luv?" A+ Back to the good stuff, and this is another groundbreaking one.  (11) Benzino feat. G. Dep & Fabolous "Bootie" (REMIX) F I hate Benzino when he's rapping.  (12) N.O.R.E "Nothin'" B+ Good, but kinda annoying after time.  (13) Foxy Brown "Stylin'" D+ I don't really like Foxy Brown.  (14) Styles P. "Good Times" F I hate Styles P! He ruined Akon's great song Locked Up!   (15) Jermaine Dupri feat. P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg and Murphy Lee "Welcome To Atlanta" (REMIX) D- This song has no point!   (16) Ludacris "Rollout (My Business) A Great song from Luda!  (17) Ying Yang Twins "Say I Yi Yi" F A rap song with no point that is just irritating.  (18) Clipse feat. N.O.R.E., Baby and Lil' Wayne "Grindin'" (REMIX) B- Good, but didn't like the remix much.  Overall Grade - D- Almost an F, this complication sucks. I'd get a better version of this series, because this is the weakest yet 
 They could have published a book that would have been a tremendous comfort to lay readers. Unfortunately, Hart's academic language is maddening--there are words here that will not be in your dictionary, and you will have to re-read parts several times to understand what the author is saying.  I would guess that most readers will give up before finishing the book. That's too bad, because Hart has important things to say. Some of the other reviewers seem to cherish his obscurity. I don't. It IS possible to present important, even complicated, ideas in an elegant way that can be also be readily understood.  To prospective buyers: skip the book and find the Wall Street Journal column. It's much more to the point. To the author: please read "Simple and Direct" by Jacques Barzun. 
 This book was LOUSY.  The one dimensional characters were horrible, but worse was the CONSTANT references to the volga deutch.  I was considering starting a drinking game taking a drink every time it was referred to, but decided I would get too drunk.  Stupid, stupid book.  Having said that, every so often this book had thoughtful insight into the lives of priests 
 When I was a small girl of six, I saw the film Fern Gully in the theater and it scared me sh...uh...poopless!! It was an OK flick up until the horrific smog monster appeared, killing all nature and singing about acid rain and sucking all living creatures dry and spitting them out like spinach!!! This movie traumatized me and gave me nightmares for at least a year or two!! This movie is a nightmare ride and if you REALLY want to show your kids a movie with a message about preserving the environment and living in harmony with nature, you'd be better off with Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" than with this film. That is, unless you want your kid to be scared for life.. 
 This is a compilation of many different styles;  look Yo-Yo can play bluegrass!  Not really "Classic" Yo-Yo 
 I admire anybody who can put a comic together, although I'm not an avid comics reader (SIN CITY remains my favorite series). That said, recent NPR, boing-boing and Entertainment Weekly reviews have raved about this sereis, prompting me to look into it. Alas, more than halfway thru book one I am at a loss to understand the glittering praise that has been heaped on this work. The premise is intriguing (if a bit far fetched), but the writing is awful. Infantile gimmicks and coincidences abound, and horrible dialog assaults your eyes and insults your intelligence in every panel. The drawnig is generic and un-memorable, but it isn't as bad as the writing. Maybe it gets way better later, but my experience is that the odds are against it. If this is an exceptional contemporary comic, lord protect us from the rest of the lot 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 Considering Groom's talents as a writer, I was disappointed in this book.  I got so bored with it that I practically had to make myself finish it.  The campaign itself is a very interesting one, but the book does not read that way.  That being said, the book does serve as a decent introduction to the Army of Tennessee and the campaign, but just is not in-depth or compelling enough for most buffs, I would think.  This book is useful as a start, but if you find yourself interested in the campaign after this book, move on to Wiley Sword's The Confederacy's Last Hurrah 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 Yeah, that's how I felt when I noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters.  Even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture.  How can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour?    Regardless, it's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery.  The kid is downright annoying but, when I was a kid I liked him!  Suppose it's not time to have kids yet, aye?  Regardless it could have been better.  Flawed  but, if you viewed this before the first one... don't let it stop you from getting the first!  The first one rocked.  I thought the 3rd one was produced much better than this as well... but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 I once again heard were terrible 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 Item was not received. There was a mix up and it was sent to the wrong address. I hope I'm not billed. 
 This title is currently being extensively SPAM-advertised, with particular reference to its availability on Amazon.  My view is that if the author/publisher needs to resort to SPAM to drum up interest then that fact in itself speaks volumes for the work.  On that basis alone I wouldn't touch it with a pole. 
 For the record, let me state that I've been surfing for 20 years and got the bug, along with most others my age, watching The Endless Summer and getting captivated by the energy and beauty of the sport.  This compilation, while very complete, really IS an encyclopedia...page, after page, after page. There are some useful tidbits of information strewn among the lengthy volume but a large majority of the book seems filled with fairly uninteresting, small, black and white photos, and biographies of just about anyone in the world who ever attempted to stand up on a board. Avoid this snore-fest and put your money into a nice hardcover coffee table book filled with glorious color shots of the world's tube riders...and leave all of the trivia to the wannabes 
 The way Brady made this guide is unacceptable! I found better information on the internet than this stupid piece of crap guide. Whoever the author was on this guide, they should be fired! They also made a crappy MK: Deception guide too. 2 bad strategy guides are totally unacceptable for a company that has had a good reputation in the past. I will never buy another Brady Guide again until they straighten up their act and be more accurate with their guides like they used to be. 
 I checked this out of the library & only read about 1/3 of it. That's about all i could take of this mean-spirited, one-sided, repetitive diatribe.  Please read the Pub Weekly review above. It gives a fair picture of this crappy book.  I have no problem w/ criticism of hollywood & celebrity, as long as it's fair & intelligent criticism. This book is neither. It's just a biased, unoriginal rant.  The worst thing i can say about it is that the tone is that of a smug, intolerant, finger-wagging, self-righteous hypocrite of the worst kind. Of course the authors, while condemning these  celebrities, have no problem making money off of them (& their misfortunes). These guys are the worst kind of blood-sucking insects.  If you're really curious, leaf through it at the library & then put it back. Please don't give these narrow-minded idiots your hard-earned money. 
 The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to "The Bourne Identity." He lost his character!  He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in "The Bourne Identity."   This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it.  I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal  There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.    I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish. 
 i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it's release why? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on HD or Blueray or a new 2 disc DVD set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie.. 
 the typical self proclaimed china hand writing books catered to the western audience with typical stories everyone hears if you are in the investing biz.  no added value except to "reveal" to the world what had happened to him or her.  do these writers trully understand china?; same question to be posed to the thousands of current and potential investors into china.  and can they offer insights that are practical, realistic and offers a true fact of what is happening daily on the ground?  i seriously doubt any writer can offer this in respect to china because china is a story of limitless permutations.  there is only one commonality in china, which is its damn hard to get it right, because there is no right or wrong in this environment.  so how does anyone who wants to know how to operate in this environment learn?  i beg to differ, but its not gonna be thru a book written by the gangs of so called "china hands" out there.  these books are like the ones that came out supporting the great hype about the "new ecnomony" when the heat was scorching white.  opportunistic but offers little value.  i'll only buy the soft cover versions of these type of books or reading it as borrowed material. there is absolutely nothing valuable in this type of undertaking other than entertaining one on a slow afternoon. the author doesn't trully understand the reasons why things and events like those that transpired while he was ther in the early 90s, he doesn't understand the deep down psychic of the chinese person that he is dealing with.  chinese as a society is very complicated and extremely difficult to "read", and with the thousands of years of upheavals and sufferings of the masses, a twisted sense of whats right or wrong flows thru to today's society.  understand the meaning of "middle kingdom" and the world will have a starting point on why things are done the way they are today.  understand why "putonghua" has to be implemented  to bring all the different sects of chinese together is also another start.  i have yet to read any of this and a hundred other basic seeds of discontent that creates the china it is of today and why it behaves the way it does.  i doubt that anyone will be able to put it in on paper with  a certain thoroughness as it will create lots of uneasiness and tensions that has been around for 5000 years.  chinese will not accept a book on this and the western reader will have difficulty fathoming the gist and hidden weight behind each nuance.  
 I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better 
 Purchased this box from my daughters Amazon Wish List, so I have no one but myself to blame. It is so small that not much salt can be stored.  She was happy with receiving this item but would not buy again 
 I have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin, leaving burn marks for weeks! Finally, I went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal. Please, check with your doctor FIRST before trying this 
 Cheesey video, bad interface, offers little instruction, tests are too easy to be useful. Save the money and go take a driving lesson from a licensed instructor instead. We purchased this to help with parallel parking.  The topic is mentioned on the video but there is virtually no instruction.  And so it goes with most of the other topics.... 
 When I purchased this, for some reason, I thought that this was historical fiction.  What I found out was that it was history.  Don't get me wrong, history about this group of people and this time frame I often find extremely interesting, but this one wasn't one of them.  Unlike one of the reviewers I found the chapter dedicated to arranging marriages extremely interesting, but unfortunately, that was about the last chapter I found interesting.  I finally gave up and placed this book in my "used book store" box where hopefully someone else will find it more to their liking.  My star ratings:   One star - couldn't finish the book   Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the author   Three stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.   Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.   Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author.  
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 Being an avid Simon Kenton fan, I was really looking forward to this book but found it quite boring. I suppose after reading Allan Eckert's "Frontiersman", any accounting of the life of Simon Kenton pales in comparison 
 I had the oportunity to listen this CD, but I am totally dissapointed, only I save four songs, the other songs are really painful, techno and stuff. I like the son by Bowling for Soup,  Lil' Red Riding Hood, is cool. 
 Do you remember MTV Unplugged? Do you remember watching your favorite bands absolutely embarrass themselves in front of coffee sipping yuppies who could only see these bands in this kind of venue because they know they'd get their tail kicked at a real show? Well, in case you forgot, now you can buy that same atrocity here and relive those magical years.  There's a reason MTV Unplugged isnt around and this CD proves it. Just listen to the samples here first before you give away your hard earned minimum-wage money. 
 I hate to be negative about a book from the German prespective, as they are rare, but I feel I must for others not to waste their money. The book is a general and basic operational overview of the end stages of combat in the Silesia area. If you are only looking for dates, places, and names of units involved this book is for you but, if you are like me, there are ZERO personal accounts included, which are needed to "flesh" out a book like this, to give you a better understanding of the various battles described. 
 This book contains a good color wheel and some useful discussion about material, but that's about it.  The art is extremely idiosyncratic, stylized, and modern, and it is not very appealing.  What's more, it appears that the author only has command of one style/genre, and that won't be of much help people who are trying to learn.  Spend your money on The North Light Book of Acrylic Painting Techniques instead 
 i bought it. didn't work. exchanged it. the new one didn't work. same problem--the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap...that's all. and yes, it does very easily rust.  spend the extra $5 and get something better 
 If you want my review in a nutshell, here it is: Two Defective Rise & Shine Lamps. One Call to Verilux. Verilux Refuses to Help.  If you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass, read on.   My Verilux Product Experience:  I exchanged my first Verilux Rise and Shine Natural Alarm Clock & Bedside Lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker, ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping (if I am to understand the Verilux' company president's response to a similar defect report in these reviews). The good news: The speaker in the second unit now works. And contrary to some of the other reviewers I feel the Mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice (with a line-in jack for CD player or iPod). The bad: Despite the jumbo LCD display that might lead you to assume that the AM/FM tuner is digital, the radio is completely analog. The station IDs are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough that some owners will need their glasses AND a magnifying glass to select a radio station. By contrast, I own an alarm clock by Conair with a similar analog tuner, with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point LCD digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit LCD display. On Verilux' comparatively enormous LCD, I am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option. An analog tuner without a station display is something I expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock, but not from a product of this type, which is otherwise very well thought out.  Unfortunately, due to an apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself, the shade on my replacement lamp -- the lamp I received from the store in exchange -- won't sit straight! One can remove the shade, look at the lamp on a level surface, and see the lamp "shelf" slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted! Making the situation worse, the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered. There are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down (as typical of most lampshades). The ring, in turn, sits on the lamp body (or shelf). The whole assembly is cockeyed, including the socket into which the bulb sets (at a VERY obvious angle)!   Cosmetically speaking, there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type. Whereas the first lamp I purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the LCD panel, the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf, and it, too, must have been obtained in manufacturing.   As for the shade itself, it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish, roughly 3/4", that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen. So while the second lamp did not have a DOA speaker, I apparently traded one problem in for another. Worse, the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room (and would probably appear that way from down the street if I were to set it on the curb). In short, the Verilux Rise & Shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price/warranty suggests. And in case you are wondering if this might have been "gray market" merchandise, it wasn't. I purchased my Rise & Shine lamp straight out of a high-end, authorized retail store, new-in-box.   The AM/FM clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light, finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5" wide at the base and 20" tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept. For this reason, I hope Verilux will continue to refine the Rise and Shine model, particularly where quality control is concerned.   Given that I am a gadget fan, and someone who has rated products 1/5th the price of this lamp very highly, it should be understood that I really wanted to give this a positive review. But two duds in a row?  IRONY  The Rise & Shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact Verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer. Given that my replacement lamp is also defective, I followed these instructions. But in reality, Verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers' problem, not theirs (as per the instruction I received to make a THIRD 40-mile trip back to the store where I purchased it). Conclusion?  VERILUX DOESN'T BACK THEIR WARRANTY (in my experience/opinion).  Nor, apparently, does Verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers. So if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong, consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience. And believe me, there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of Verilux' customer service department, either.  What Verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the Internet. As it so happens, I supplement my income writing product reviews for Websites. In fact, I am a writer by training/trade. Translation: Verilux chose the wrong customer to let down. I have no intention of smearing Verilux' reputation -- unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such.  Would I recommend this product to a friend? Yesterday I might have said yes, chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke. Today, coupled with the fact that Verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy, my answer is a resounding NO.  Should anyone at Verilux read my review, I wish to close with this thought: I could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems I noted, but a ~$5 lampshade, to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box -- and doesn't sit straight, to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy?  
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 I think the Melvins' career can be broken into a few clearly separate "acts":  Prelude- 1983 to 1985   Hardcore. Loud, fast, snotty. (see: Deep Six compilation album, EDIT- and the soon-to-be-released Mangled Demos)    Act 1- 1986 to 1989  Buzz (founder, guitarist, songwriter) was heavily inspired (no pun intended) by Black Flag's 'My War' album, particularly side 2, which was composed of three very long droning dirges. The Melvins' songs became a bit heavier and often slower. Some of their earlier songs might have been considered speed metal, but at this point you could hear a definite '70s "regular" heavy metal element in some songs. A very original sound at the time, many other local bands followed suit; the Melvins' change in direction is arguably single-handedly responsible for starting the "grunge" thing in Seattle, for better or worse. (see: debut EP, Gluey Porch Treatments, Ozma)  Act 2- 1990 to 1992  Their sound became, for lack of a less lame cliche, extreme. They were no longer "kinda heavy," they were extremely heavy. The song writing and live performances became confrontational. Riffs and rhythms were often so drawn out and plodding that they were scarcely recognizable. In other instances there were no riffs at all, a storm of white noise taking their place. Listening to the Melvins sometimes made you feel like you were a mastodon slowly sinking into a tar pit. I personally consider this to be the Melvins' at their peak. One of my personal highlights was seeing them play in Costa Mesa CA in 1991; in the middle of their set, Buzz began spewing atonal noise from his amp while Dale pretended to hit his drums. This went on for several minutes. Some fratboy types, at the behest of their girlfriends, approached the stage to make them stop. Their demands and pleas fell on deaf ears. Glorious.(see: Bullhead, Eggnog, Lysol [a.k.a. "Melvins"/self titled])   Act 3- 1993 to present  Houdini marks the beginning of this era. The Melvins suddenly abandoned the heavy approach. They completely lost focus and embarked on journey of discovery that usually involved ho-hum "hard rock" song writing and dabbling in experimental weirdness. Unfortunately, the experiments almost always fail. Or at least fail to be enjoyable listening. (see: Houdini, Stoner Witch, Stag, and whatever else they've put out in the last 10 years)  As far as I'm concerned, they do still squirt out the occasional great song, but by and large they probably could have called it quits in 1994 and left the music world a beautiful corpse to admire forever and ever. It happens all the time. A band spends all of their creative juices until nothing's left, but they keep going. Not that I blame them. What else are they supposed to do? Sell insurance?   EDIT- "to dismiss 'what ever they have done in the last ten years' without even bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant."  I agree, that IS ignorant. You'll be happy to know that I own and have listened to every single record the Melvins have ever released, including Never Breathe, with the one exception of Roman Empire. (EDIT- I now own Roman Empire) I would have listed them all by name, but there are a lot of them, and their titles weren't readily jumping into my mind anyway. And I'll continue to buy their records, always in the hope that they somehow get the fire back and do something worthwhile again. I'll let you know as soon as that happens.   EDIT- "The truth is, the Melvins, while most worthy of the played out "grunge" title, are not responsible for it at all. They are in fact "dirge metal". They are not Northwest, rather Bay Area."  Incorrect, sir. The Melvins formed in WA circa 1983. According to Kim Thayil, the "Seattle scene" was your average hardcore punk scene at the time, but after the Melvins slowed down and took on a more metallic sound, a lot of the bands in the area followed suit. That was how the "grunge" thing began. They didn't move to San Francisco CA until 1988 or '89. 
 I bought a paperback that included both "Of Mice and Men"(OMM) and "Cannery Row."  For me, "Cannery Row" seemed like it was not written by the same author. Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, "Cannery Row" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?    I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), "Cannery Row" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study.  And therein lied the problem for me-too many characters I had no interest in.   I have to side with the other reviewers who suggest Steinbeck's other work in order to absorb the full wonder of this man.            
 While this biography of a fine, mysterious player is adequate, Casway's assertion that  19th Century baseball was an "Emerald Age," due to Irish dominance is ludicrous. Almost all the top ball players were of English ancestry at the time, which reflected the U.S. immigrant population. With the exclusion of Negroes, Latins etc. Irish did stand out as a "colorful" minority 
 THIS BOOK JUST SEEMS LIKE A JOKE BOOK & IT'S NOT FUNNY. I WAS EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED, ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THE GLOWING REVIEWS. 'THE TIGER WHO CAME TO TEA' OR 'I AM NOT SLEEPY & WILL NOT GO TO BED' ARE SO MUCH BETTER- TRY ONE OF THEM INSTEAD. 
 As one reviewer so eloquently pointed out, Anne Marie Oliver and Paul Steinberg show a complete disregard for political and social factors in their extremely superficial and biased analysis of suicide terrorism. In order to describe the true motives behind suicide attacks, one must look into the root causes of suicide terrorism. Contrary to popular belief, a typical suicide bomber is not a religious zealot seeking to destroy the West because he abhors our liberal values. In point of fact, most suicide bombers are secular individuals, as corroborated by the fact that the group responsible for most suicide attacks in the world the Tamil Tigers are adamantly opposed to religion. Admittedly, religion is often used as a tool to recruit new suicide bombers by promising them eternal life in paradise. Nonetheless, religion is by no means a primary motive behind suicide terrorism. While its importance should not be downplayed or denied, it only plays a secondary role.   Robert Pape has in my opinion conducted the most meticulous and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism. What makes Pape's study so superior to every other book on suicide terrorism is that it refuses to make simplistic and unsubstantiated claims. It delves deep into the root causes of suicide terrorism and is not afraid to ask the dangerous questions. Pape's study demonstrates without a doubt that most suicide bombers are driven primarily by political motives. According to Pape, the principal motive of suicide bombers is to obliterate the presence of foreign powers from the areas that suicide bombers consider to be their homelands. Therefore, simply labeling a Palestinian suicide bomber as a religious fanatic driven solely by religious motives is a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification. Most Palestinian suicide bombers have divulged that their primary motive is to fight the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and to relieve the suffering of their people. They believe that the only way to fight a much more powerful adversary is to resort to suicide missions. In the view of the Palestinian suicide bombers all targets are legitimate since they are at war with Israel. They also believe that they have the right to retaliate against the Israeli killing of the Palestinian children and women which Israel by the way conveniently labels as the "collateral damage".   Understanding suicide terrorism does not suggest in any way that it is morally justifiable. But if we really wish to understand its root causes then we must tell the truth and refrain from making sensationalistic albeit incorrect and misleading conclusions. People who live under the Israeli occupation are subjected daily to humiliation and derogatory comments. They live in abject poverty where desperation, despair and hopelessness are omnipresent. It is out of these gruesome conditions that suicide terrorism emerges. Imagine being humiliated and mistreated every day in your own country by an extremely powerful bully. What would you do?   All these factors are somehow overlooked or at best downplayed in this book. Subsequently, the conclusions are erroneous, inaccurate and biased. I recommend Robert Pape's brilliant book Dying to Win The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism and John Esposito's Unholy War Terror in the Name of Islam. In addition to these books, I recommend an extremely powerful and disturbing movie Paradise Now.     
 The 24 show is twisted into an unrecognizable pretzel in this middling thriller. I completely agree with the other bad reviews and warnings for 24 fans on this book. It's a fairly pedestrian, generic thriller as thrillers go but what's awful is it isn't 24. Whatever you think about Jack's worrying and agonizing in this book, "Kelly Sharpton" is the hero, hands down, not Jack Bauer. Was this guy a minor walk-on character from somewhere in season's past or did the author make him up? Whatever. I didn't sign up to read about that dude. I cracked the book open because of Jack.  It's sad to see Jack relegated to a boob for a lot of this book. Yeah, sure, he wins in the end, proves Ryan wrong, etc...but it's a heck of a long time to wait and a heck of a lot of pages to read to get there. Not like the show at all that let's you see Jack being a badass and heroic in every episode. And...(again, you have to be a fan to understand) that's the defining characteristic of the show.  There's an awful lot of "snarling" and eyes "popping open" and hearts beating against chests for what's being characterized as a well-written book. I also thought the evil ex-military white supremacist racist villains were...uh, cliche? (in concept and execution, yes). And also a missed opportunity to deal with more interesting threats in a geo-politically complicated world (Marc Cerasini's books are far superior to this one on all points--better written, better plotted, better villains, better grasp of the threats facing the U.S. and the world today. He's got Jack locked down, and is on target with what 24 should be. Vince Flynn's books are closer to the spirit of 24 than Veto Power--Flynn is consulting with the 24 writers this season.)  But back to Veto Power. It's interesting to see the Patriot Act characterized as some sort of time bomb that's a bigger threat to the U.S. than the enemies that have killed 3,000 of its citizens and wish to kill the rest. But forget the politics of whether you agree with the author's strident, constant, and less than subtle handling of his anti-Patriot Act theme. My question is: does that strike you as 24? Does 24 strike you as a show that lectures us all on how we need to worry about men like Jack Bauer and his threat to our freedoms? Do you think maybe this author thought he was writing a West Wing novel? There are certainly enough jarring and obvious (borderline juvenile) caricatures for Bush and Rove and Ashcroft (more of the author's agenda being shoved down my throat so awkwardly and obviously I had trouble getting through this book).  In sum: what I love about the 24 show is that Jack Bauer is heroic. As Joel Surnow said in an interview (Cigar Aficionado mag., check it out)--this is the only show on TV that deals with the war on terrorism in a heroic manner. I'm sorry to warn 24 fans that Jack is not heroic in this book. He's not Jack to me. It's a letdown to keep expecting Jack to take control and be the man he is in the show...but it just doesn't happen. I also miss Tony (a missed opportunity to really use him in this book) and the less said about this author's ridiculous depiction of the excellent character Nina, the better (but she isn't in it much, anyway. Most of the book features made up characters never seen in 24). Too bad. This book is a missed opportunity for a good 24 read.   
 this book was not well thought out. it was just an attempt to sound intelligent, but failed. the purpose of a book the should be to enlighten your readers not with big sounding words but with good ones that best describe the situation you are trying to get across. to me the book had nothing to do with tupac, it dealt with the author's lack of ability to put words together to form a sentence that could capture his audience. he just used the icon's name to sell his book, and true we fell for it, the true fans of tupac. we try so hard to grasp hold on anything and anyone that can give us more facts than we already have, so it pains me when people do things like this book which was so so so poorly written. i would hate to have a face to face conversation with him. PAC will always be in our hearts, thoughts and thanks to the real Gs he will be on our radios, TVs, VCRs & DVDs. as PAC would say, "NEVER IGNORANT GETTING GOALS ACCOMPLISHED. 
 after owning a number of thermos' and other insulated bottles, this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break!  parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner ($3.90 and $8.60, respectively), cheaper to get another carafe.  after buying 5 total during the past year, i'm down to my last one.  thats it, going to another manufacturer.  I did prechill the carafe before filling with ice-water and ice.  i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour.  Followed carefully with ice.  Upon putting the 1st cube in the bottle, the glass liner loudly shattered.  I have never seen liners break so easily.  I did notice on the last bottle i have left, before using it, the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe.  i took it apart, and hand tightened everything.  so far okay. this is the last carafe i'll buy that is zorirushi made 
 I was really looking forward to starting this book based on the positive reviews.  But I was very disapointed.  I had a very difficult time reading this book.  It is slow to develop and filled with many unnecessary details 
 At first glance this is a good CD set, though what you won't find out until you buy the CD and listen to it is that some tracks are "radio freindly" edits while other songs remain true to the "Explicit Lyric" stickers designed back in the day especially for artists like NWA.  To me it's an injustice to NWA to put censored versions of their songs on a compilation CD labeled as their legacy.  If you're going to come, come correct and put the real versions of EVERY NWA song on the CD, don't mix and match Radio Edits and Explicit content, NWA was not, and is not a radio friendly band.  If you want to put out an all clean version of the CD that's fine, but then put out an all explicit version of the CD as well to truely show those too young to remember exactly what the legacy of NWA is.  It was groups like NWA and 2 Live Crew that prompted the record industry to create explicit lyric stickers as the profanity spewed on albums such as "Straight out of Compton" was unheard of at the time.  To make a long story short you can't do the legacy of the first gangsta rap band justice by censoring the raw emotions invoked by the profanity in their lyrics.  There were also a lot of tracks I'd have liked to see on this two disc set that didn't make it.  "Automobile" and "100 Miles & Runnin'" form the CD with the aforementioned name would have been welcome additions.  Would have been nice too to throw on "Panic Zone" or anything from "NWA and the Posse" which featured The Arabian Prince when he was still a member of NWA.  This 2 CD set left me with a sour taste in my mouth, mostly due to the censorship of some of the songs included.  Case in point: the remix of "It was a good day", I loved the disco beat in the background but it was completely ruined the second I heard Ice Cube swerve off to the clean version of the song.  Avoid this set, and buy NWAs released CDs, then you can relive their legacy as it was meant to be remembered 
 I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
 Charles Upton, I am sad to say, is no Rene Guenon. While Guenon eschewed apologetics, marking his writings as the work of a real sage, Upton cannot resist making the arguments that Guenon made earlier and better. In fact, due to his long history as a beatnik, hippy, New Ager, and mainstream liberal, Upton has a hard time shedding many of the problematic baggage he has accumulated over the years. He praises Noam Chomsky and still seems constantly susceptible to egalitarian, moralistic thinking at nearly every turn. In short, Upton has decided to write a book on a subject he is not yet qualified to pontificate about. While reading his book, I wondered whether he will migrate, at some future point, away from "Traditionalism" in the same way he moved on from the New Age and his other interests. The saddest, and yet at the same time most fascinating aspect of his book, is how he manages to unintentionally render Tradition appear to be yet another facet of the New Age. He mixes up Hindu, Christian, and Islamic ideas while complaining about New Age syncretism. He claims to have "transcended dogma" but does not "deny it." This is the same trick many New Age people assert they can do too. At no point does Upton see that there are problems and legitimate objections to some of his assertions, and he avoids venturing into any area that deals frankly with possible holes in either his approach or his argument. I would heartily recommend this book to people to watch a soi disant Traditionalist fall flat on his face. I am disappointed that SP, a publishing house that usually has high standards, went for this mess of a book. 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 I bought this CD thinking it was the 2 CD set I saw in the commercial, and I was wrong.  It is a single CD with only half of what the TV version has 
 Larry the Cable is the most overrated comedian out there. I love when people make fun of white trash like in the classic movie Joe Dirt, but Larry the Cable Guy isn't remotely funny. Even on the rare occasion he has a decent joke. everytime he will say 'thats funny right there, thats funny' or 'git-r-done'  Larry the Cable Guy is overrated, I dont care who you are he's overrated 
 As an extended story on film, Stephen King popcorn entertainment doesn't get better. Julian Sands, Kevin Tighe, Nancy Travis and the rest of the cast do their best. But the story of a parapsychologist assembling a team of psychic athletes to investigate a long-haunted house with a history of inexplicable deaths is the legacy of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House," made into a genuinely frightening classic film by Robert Wise, "The Haunting." Do yourself a favor ... get the Wise film. This TV fare is creepy and entertaining, but by no means memorable 
 I was amazed by this book because of its lack of actual information that related to drawing storyboards! There are many chapters telling you how to dress for your interview and pages dedicated to checking you attitude for  working in the industry. Subjects of various aspects of the fields inner  workings. Sadly the number of pages used to teach storyboard techniques  from methods of describing camera tracks and pans and all the other  essential descriptions are bascially nonexistent. There may have been 2  pages in which the author attempted to poorly describe a pan or zoom in. I  was very angry and confused that the title had been so misleading, if this  book is used in classes as I have read in other posts, then that is the  class to avoid! Mark Simon is a very poor artist also and relys often on  other storyboards to illustrate the few examples in this silly waste of  paper. Among them Alex Savik, who was once a artist for Marvel comics. I  had often wonder where he had gone to? Aside from that, there was nothing  of value within these pages that could not be gotten from viewing better  artists boards. This seems to be an attempt by an artist that doesnt make  money doing boards to bring in extra cash without giving out any additional  information on storyboarding so as to not enable any others to take work  from him, if he should get so lucky. This is not a scathing review merely  obvious 
 Written by the fellow who gave the world "Monkeybone" (Sam Hamm) and directed by the gentleman responsible for "Loony Tunes: Back in Action" (Joe Dante ... okay, okay, he also did "Gremlins"), "Homecoming" is yet another "Masters of Horror" misfire.  This time around, the story concerns a world where right-wing political pundits inadvertantly cause dead American soldiers to come back to life.  David Murch (Jon Tenney) and Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill doing her best Anne Coulter imitation) offer up the typical Republican soundbites in defense of the (tactfully unnamed) President's ill-advised War in Iraq.  One of those soundbites?  "I wish those soldiers COULD come back, because I'm sure they'd tell America how proud they were to serve and give their life for this great country of ours."  Or something to that effect.  What do you know?  The Republicans get their wish.  Of course, the zombie soldiers AREN'T glad that they're dead.  And what is their idea of vengeance?  They demand the right to vote against the President.  That's right.  As soon as their dissenting ballots are cast, they drop lifelessly to the floor, their point having been made.  This little vignette makes ITS point in the first seven minutes of filming, and then it just keeps on making it over and over again.  Some have said that your enjoyment of the show will depend on your political bent, but I think any clear-headed individual can see that no matter your governmental ideologies, this is just one long, slow, poorly-written joke.  There IS some dark humor here, but it's also unintelligent, hateful, and obvious.  Ah well.  Propaganda isn't known for its tact.  "Homecoming" has a vendetta, and that's all it has.  I'm all for exposing corruption and deceit, but even if there are those who agree with this film's message (and many, many do), I fail to see how those same people can also agree with the film's self-righteous moralizing, its hate, its presumption.  After all, this little "screw you" to the current administration props up its high horse on the idea that the conservatives are only promoting their own selfish agendas by claiming to speak for America's fallen men and women.  But "Homecoming" is guilty of the exact same offense.  By the last frame, it's obvious that no one in the show is aware of the self-defeating irony of their proselytizing, which is really the only horrific thing about this turkey 
 If you think this book is about creating geometric solids from sheet metal, or how to mark out a cone and fold it to shape, or the basic principles of sheet metal work, then think again. It is about one man's  project of recreating an old car from sheet metal and the tools and methods  he used to achieve this goal. There is nothing in this book that would  assist the beginner metal worker to build even a simple tool box. I  purchased this book in the belief (silly me) that it would contain  information that would assist me fold,bend and shape sheet metal into basic  everyday things like tool boxes, box trailers,pipe bending etc. This book  is more for the advanced automotive body builder who specialises in the  restoration of old cars,hot rods and customising autos.A more suitable  title for this book would be "Automotive Sheet Metal  Fabrication", which would not be so misleading to the web browser.  This book was purchased on title alone as there were no prior book reviews  to assist identify its contents and assist in the selection. If I was into  auto restoration this would be a handy book to have and would rate it a 3  for content,but I understood this book to be a manual to assist the  everyday metal worker in his/her work. No references to using a pan brake  folder when bending,no projects to test the newly acquired skills and  nothing on developing and making various geometric shapes from sheet metal.  Well, we live and learn from our mistakes and if I knew the real content of  this book I would not have bought it. Kind regards Uncle Bob 
 Three composers worked on this album, one of which is the infamous Nobuo Uematsu, and it still turned out pretty flat. I feel ashamed to say that, too, because I've been such a fan of Final Fantasy music, but there just wasn't a whole lot to this soundtrack. A few songs stood out to me, but I really had to stretch my taste to accept them. Nothing on here is bad, though. It's just... not epic, not revolutionary. Doesn't make you cry or want to sing. It's just THERE. Good background music, but you can always find plenty of that. -- One of the composers, Kumi Tanioka, did the entire Crystal Chronicles soundtrack herself. That actually turned out really good, and is much better than this collection of mediocrity 
 Mike Evens has done a good job of describing the very real and existing threat posed by Iran and radical Islam that is hell-bent on world domination. We do well to give careful heed to his warning. If we somehow doubt the content of this book we need only look at the news coming out almost daily, in the proclaimations and threats spoken by Ahmadbinejad himself. The contents of Mikes book are no secret. I strongly recomend this book to all who love the truth. I have bought several copies and am giving them away. Yes sir Mike, you have hit the nail on the head with this book and it could not be coming out at a better time. 
 If you have paid much attention to Christian music publications from the last decade or so you have already read a large portion of this book.  It's not that it simply says the same thing, rather some of the artists sections are the exact same interviews that I had previously read in HM or the like 
 It's TM for golfers with a Scotish accent.  Can't believe this book has a following 
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 The title could be misleading...don't be confused. This book is great for discussing skills needed by presenters.  It is not a how-to book for designing or promoting  seminars 
 Such a simple concept which is in essence -  "Make a list of things to do"  "Decide when and how to do them"   Explained in such away as to make anyone dizzy, the book is the most poorly organised I think I have ever seen. The author never wanting to use a sentence to describe something when a page of words will do.  If you really treasure your time please do not waste any of it with this book 
 'Post Modernism' often just sounds like an excuse to ramble incessant contradictory bs to justify the meaning behind why things are the way they are.  It's some stupid alternative term for the cycle of evolution.  The fact that the world is growing and ideas are changing. It's an interesting, yet very puzzling and irritating topic.  The bottomline is - Post Modernism is open to personal interpretation and it's meaning is based on your own understanding and perceptions in response to it.  You don't have to influenced by college textbooks or the typical cocky college-educated smart-@$$.  Anyone who truly appeciates 'art' (I believe) should be open-minded and accepting towards different ideas and responses, and not constantly bitching and whining, trying to reinforce their own presumedly educated understanding of the ideals and aesthetics behind Post-modernism or whatever.  As far as I am concerned, 'Post-bloody-Modernism' is over (if it ever existed) and we should all just enjoy art for what it is and not what it must be

 Ok I have to tell you, about a year ago I was looking forward to playing a show with this supposedly garage rock group from Denmark, who had been hyped continually.  The album may be good, don't know as I haven't heard it, but they put on one of the most boring live shows I've ever seen, the only standout being a cover song.   Big let down and basically a hipster joke, best part was watching four guys in beatle boots trying to carry a 3oo pound hammond down a set of stairs into the room where the club held their shows.  Honestly I wasn't impressed at all....  
 Once again QuickBooks dangles promises to us Mac folk that just don't add up. If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point?  Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07. 
 Is it just me, or is Steve Morse simultaneously the most boring and most annoying guitar player on the planet? (I knew something was up a few years back when I went into the used CD store and it had numerous Steve Morse solo CDs and a few Dixie Dregs CDs. I listened to this stuff for hours and it was the most excruciatingly dull stuff I had heard in some time). With Purple, too much of his playing is what I call "junk" - no imagination or creativity, no catchy sequence of notes that stick in your head, but instead a repetitive pattern of playing a few notes fast, interspersed with what sounds like his hand slipping off the strings, interspersed with lots of awful groaning sounds. This is great guitar playing? It is not my cup of tea. I read in an interview that Ian Gillan said that Deep Purple doesn't rehearse very often and from what Morse plays, that is evident. It sounds like he is just making it up as he goes along or that it took about 10 seconds to come up with this same repetitive junk. I get the feeling that Mr. Morse is more a technician than a guitar PLAYER. His repetitive patterns of fast notes and groaning sounds are more noisy than musical. There is rarely any feeling in his playing and no sense of melody. Don't get me wrong. I am not saying Mr. Morse is a lousy guitar player, I am just saying he is annoying and boring and his style just does not fit the Deep Purple sound at all. Throughout the 70s and 80s Purple was known for its simple, catchy riffs that stuck in your head. In stark contrast, Steve Morse could not come up with a catchy riff if his life depended on it, but then again, when you are schooled in jazz-rock fusion, catchiness is not going to be your forte. It has become painfully clear from Abandon and especially Bananas and now with Rapture that Steve Morse's jazz-rock fusion guitar style is totally inappropriate for a riff-rock band like Deep Purple. A much better choice would have been Steve Hillage, whose psychedelic rock style would have been an interesting addition to the Purple arsenal or even Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree. Instead we are left to suffer through one lifeless, melody-starved herky-jerky mid-tempo plodder after another. It has become painfully evident that Ritchie Blackmore was the creative driving force behind this band and without him, this once great band has become a mere shell of its former self. It doesn't help that Ian Gillan's voice, while not completely shot, is only capable of hitting notes in a much more limited range than in years past. That said, Rapture has a few songs on it which I like (they are by no means great songs or classics, but they range from not bad to pretty good) and is an improvement over its coaster-prototype predecessor Bananas. The title track, Before Time Began and the witty, clever Clearly Quite Absurd show that indeed, Mr. Gillan still does have something to say lyrically. And as long as Steve Morse stays away from the awful groaning sounds and plays notes straight, his playing is actually tolerable. I like what Morse does with Highway Star - he adds different notes but the song is still recognizable as the classic that it is and The Well Dressed Guitar (Studio Version) is a pleasant, upbeat classically-influenced instrumental.  Things I Never Said is not bad and features the by-now familiar trademark of guitar and organ tradeoffs lifted from the Blackmore days. I wouldn't recommend this to the non-Purple fan or even casual Purple fan, but if you are so much of a Purple fan that you MUST buy this, I would strongly recommend that you get the Special Edition with Bonus CD as the second (bonus) CD is better than the first CD and only for a dollar more in price. The first CD is so mediocre I don't listen to it at all but I do listen to the aforementioned songs from the second CD 
 Similarities: The cover looks exactly the same, the main character goes by "Lang" (Lang Reilly - Robert Langdon!!), it takes place all over Europe, the storyline also has to do with the Knights Templar, people die, etc. (Seems as if the author doesn't have very many original ideas...)  Differences: The main charachter is not likeable, many many spelling mistakes (??), the last page is uneccesary (in my opinion), and it seemed like important parts didn't get the attention to detail that they deserved.  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it held my interest enough for me to finish it, but it's not something I would read again 
 The unique screen chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of "The African Queen." Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to "True Grit" wouldn't pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project -- he might have improved upon Martha Hyer's routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a blaze of glory with "The Shootist" (1976) 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way. Anyway, some ideas are good to be kept aside,  but amount of such ideas don't justify the book size 
 I am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival, and I have to agree with anybody that says this movie is [...]. The whole cast is wasted in this movie, and most of which I have seen in movies that I liked better. Like pretty much the leads in this movies, I have seen thier movies and liked htem better in, but this one, they might as well. If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs. Here are 99 minuts of my life, that I won't see again, and I am trying to make sure that you don't waste your time on this dud. Who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog, in some scenes in the movie, ore pretty much the whole thing. I haven't seen Monster House or Cars, but I hope that these will be 2 better movies, or maybe a season dvd of Home Improvement will be pretty then this. Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant & Strictland. And he doesn't much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh's PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.         
 While I was tempted to give Out for a Kill 1 star, I gave it 2 stars for a couple of reasons. At least Seagal's character was something other than an ex-CIA/special forces guy...OK he was Chi Kung master, but at least he was something else! Another reason for the upgrade to 2 stars is the plot. Yes. There was nothing special with this plot, but at least it is one that can be followed. Unlike most of Seagal's most recent storyline, this one makes some sense. Again, it's certainly no Academy Award winner, but it's much better than some of Seagal's most recent efforts. Perhaps the biggest reason for giving this two stars is that 1 Star should be saved for his truly atrocious films such as The Patriot or Submerged. The fight scenes were decent but I'd love to see Seagal get back to more of the Aikido that he used in earlier films.  As was the case with the last Seagal film that I watched, the sound quality was awful. Rather than raising and lowering the volume to hear the dialogue, I simply turned on the subtitles. I'm more a fan (or simply a glutton for punishment) than my wife. She stopped watching after 15 minutes 
 Remember when Garth Brooks changed his identity, appearance and song writing and put out a lite-rock album under the name of Chris Gaines? 'Set This Circus Down' is McGraw's Chris Gaines album. But where Garth Brooks failed miserably, McGraw does an okay job. The rock songs on 'Set This Circus Down' are the best parts of the album. 'Angel Boy' is a really good tune, and if it would have come out in the mid 80's would have been a cross-over hit for sure. 'Things Change' is basically McGraw excusing himself for leaving his country roots, and pay homage to several other cross-over artists like Elvis and Hank Williams. But outside of those songs, the rest of the album is formulaic. Tim McGraw fans will like it, but it won't win over anyone new. Most of the other songs follow the usual McGraw pattern, of him being jilted or dumped and pining for lost love along the lines of his previous hits 'Don't Take The Girl', 'Just to See You Smile'. I think 'Set This Circus Down' was testing the waters to see if there would be cross-over appeal for Tim like there is for his wife, but it seems people are willing to accept female country vocalist in Top 40 like Shania and Faith Hill, but they are not ready for country male vocalists yet 
 I bought this one in Bed, Bath & Beyond.  The cotton cover is so thin that it tore within a month of use and the thin, cheap foam pad moves around and bunches up.  To make matters worse, you cannot get a cover for it anywhere, including Polder!!  I told BB&B that they are selling an ironing board that they do not sell a cover for and that you cannot get a cover for.  There are Polder covers, but they are either too long or the pull cord is on the wide end and does not fit between the board and the iron holder on the end.  After spending a lot of time looking and so much frustration, I returned it for a Rowenta model 
 This book is a notorious piece of total junk: junk logic, junk scholarship, junk law. Huber popularized the inspired neologism "junk science" to denigrate views and outcomes he didn't like. Since publication this book has been praised by those who don't want any  interference with corporate behavior, no matter how reprehensible, and  vilified by those on the other side. In the middle are a broad range of  scholars who have pointed out the sloppy scholarship, nonexistent  historiography, and misleading choice of examples. Real junk. Get it from  the library. Huber is already rich enough charging huge lecture fees from  his corporate clack. An excellent and balanced book on this subject is  Sheila Jasanoff's, Science at the Bar 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 Out of all of the first season MOH episodes this was the one (besides the unaired Takashi Miike episode) that I had the highest hopes for, but in traditional MOH fashion I was disappointed yet again.  You think somebody would at least accidentally make a good episode.  Angela Bettis giving a performance so stiff it's painful to watch - think the robot from "Small Wonder" with the voice of Ted Levine - is Ida, an entomologist, who receives a strange insect in the mail.  Unknowing to her the bug bites her hot girlfriend's ear and the ear swells up super fugly and squirts puss.  Ida never notices this mutation even after days of off screen (boo!!!) lovemaking.  What I just described took 40 minutes of screen time.  [Spoilers]  The last 20 minutes with its grand total body count of two (boo!!!) isn't much better, Ida discovers that her hot girlfriend has been taken over by the insect and has murdered the landlady.  The hot girlfriend then kills a friend of Ida's and distracts her while the bug sticks his icky thing in Ida's ear.  How exciting.    Here are just a few of my problems with this story: Why waste so much time with Ida and her hot girlfriend hooking up?  Why not just have them together from the beginning?  Why make such a huge deal out of them being lesbians?  Do entomologists really have bugs crawling out of their clothes at all times?  The body count is two.  Why waste time with the pointless revenge subplot?  Ida doesn't notice her hot girlfriend shooting pus out of her ear 
 I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas.  The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play.  But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back.  In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form.  A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn.  A good abs and waist workout as well.  There are alot of twisting moves.  The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one.  Michael only performs half of the exercises himself.  He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention.  I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.     He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout.  But its easy to manage without them.  
 Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, "could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?"  Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.  A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature 
 The vendors never sent me the CD...I am very disappointed with the service this time through amazon.  
 If you want a historical perspective on the H2O2 studies conducted during the past century, this is the book.  I should have saved my money.  I recommend "Flood Your Body With Oxygen: Therapy For Our Poluted World" by Ed McCabe.  McCabe explains it so that the information is understandable and usefull.    
 The diagrams are a little too schematic, showing some muscle bellies well displaced from their actual positions.  What's worse is that the software doesn't have any pictures available for many of the muscles listed.  There was also at least one difference from Gray's Anatomy that I think Gray got right and this book didn't.  If I'd been able to try this before buying, I wouldn't have bought it 
 Between sending our country to war over false pretenses (ie; Bush's personal greed), terrible response to Hurricane Katrina, this whole anti-gay thing, and the failure that was No Child Left Behind, I'd have to say that Bush is not a very good leader. That and the guy can't seem to acknowledge  BTW, I myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it. If you can see it in no other way, the gays might strike back, the way the blacks reacted to whites (and believe me, they had a good reason to) when they were being treated like crap in the '60's. So unless you want riots through your city, you'll at least try to be tolerant. This goes out to all you anti-gay people. And remember; Don't hate people without logical reason! (See, I have good reasons to hate Bush! 
 The purpose of this book is to teach the ability to hear in your mind what you see on paper. There isn't a single exercise in which you actually listen to music, intervals, chords, etc. -- unless it's the music you sight sing yourself. In other words, Mr. Prosser teaches movable-Do sight singing, not what most people would consider ear training in which you use your real ears, not your mind's ear. Now, sight singing is indeed one route to ear training as the two are both complementary and overlapping. But this is completely unclear from the book's title, and the picture of headphones on the cover doesn't exactly help either. The lack of an accompanying CD should have been a clue. I give the book four stars as a sight singing manual and subtract two stars for the surprise I got when I looked inside 
 Kenneth Alfred Ham knows everything about dinosaurs.  Absolutely amazing things about dinosaurs.  Things that no other living man or woman knows.  And he wants to share all of it with you.  His very special gift to children everywhere is the book "D is for Dinosaur."  Here are some other letters you need to keep in mind before purchasing this flight of fancy or reading it to your children:  A is for Absurdities more than a few.  B is for Beliefs that are cruelly abused.  C is for Charlatans that prey on the young.  D is for Delusions from which you should run.  E is for Evidence which must be supplied.  F is for facts quickly denied.  G is for Glaring mistakes and omissions.  H is for simply Hysterical opinions.  I is for Intellect left behind.  J is for Juvenile when in a factual bind.  K is for Knowledge never used.  L is for Legitimacy so sadly abused.  M is for Manic hand waving and tantrums.  N is for Never happened as stated here.  P is for Pandering to prejudice and fear.  Q is for Queries the author doesn't want to hear.  R is for Reality left unrepresented.  S is for Science silenced and undefended.  T is for Truth for which you must look elsewhere.  U is for Unsupported assertions everywhere.  V is for Veracity sadly lacking.  W is for Whopper with smirking satisfaction.  X is for Xanex or whatever the author was on.  Y is for Young Earth Creationism a notorious yarn.  Finally Z is for Zilch, the value of this book.  Don't waste your time, don't give it a look.   "D is for Dinosaur" is little more than creationist propaganda and histrionics aimed at children.  The cynicism of this ploy is standard operating procedure for Ken Ham author.  All of his published works singularly fail to distinguish fact from fancy.  Do your children a favor - instead of serving up some half-baked Ham how about the Dr. Suess classic "Green Eggs and Ham."  They will be forever grateful. 
 I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings "If I had Possession Over Judgement Day" are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest 
 This book was my first choice since we are trying to conceive our first child, but upon reading this book I feel like we must change every habit and completely re-design our bodies in order to get pregnant!!! Now, it's a given you quit smoking (we're non-smokers) and cut back on the alcohol but some of the information is far-fetched. It makes you wonder what IS safe to eat, which over-the-counter medications are safe even if not trying to conceive! My wife and I wish we would have read Amazon's reviews BEFORE buying this book, we would have saved our money and had a little more self-confidence. The sad part is, even though this author is a convicted felon he will still make money off this book!! 
 I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a  man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture.  Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around  children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back  cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the  inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's  cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption 
 This book tries to cover so many topics that it only provides snippets on each subject.  The typical topic is two paragraphs long and is mostly anecdotal 
 Hurrah for "sustainability" and "biodiversity"! Down with the human race 
 This movie held truth in it then the rest of them and some people says that its better then the first. Its an 80's movie people! It was bound to look poor, but this movie is another matter. The gore scenes were alright, but once again the people who made the series screwed up. They are so into killing in all of these sequals that they never acually have the chance to make it better. Another King classic shutting down, thats what. But lets go back to the movie. What the hell happened at the end? And that POTATO was He Who Walks Behind The Rows? Damn it to hell! The one chance of a good COTC movie and all of us beg for one, RIGHT? But no. I'm sorry, but it will never happen and I think it never will. The movie didn't work for me at all 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 This item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 Huntington's notorious observations about Mexicans are only one component of how insidious this book is, and they need to be taken in the context of the larger, generally chauvinistic vision that the book promotes.  This book, packaged as a scholarly work, is actually a piece of populism and of zealotry.  It is populism because it argues for a plain truth that "the people," "the patriotic public," can see, which the "denationalized elites" (a term he uses frequently) are trying to subvert.  It is zealotry because he cannot see past the glories of "Anglo-Protestant culture," and the only concerns that he expresses about America's future are over factors which might threaten to contaminate "Anglo-Protestant culture."    He shows that he is aware of the persistence of American racism, but there is not one sentence in the book which expresses concern for the importance of reducing or eliminating racism in the future (though yes, the book does have numerous disclaimers to racism and numerous expressions of approval of the civil rights movement and a multiracial population).  In his discussion of immigrants, there is not one sentence in the book which expresses concern for the importance of immigrants receiving fair treatment in the United States.  When it comes to treatment of immigrants, the only concern that he shows is over the difference between permissiveness for nonassimilation versus insistence that immigrants assimilate.  He writes of the binary between assimilation and non-assimilation in simplistic terms which show complete contempt for those historians and sociologists who have written volumes on the complexity of the issues of cultural adaptation.  He also writes of nationalism, not as something that is healthy in moderate doses tempered with other considerations, but as something which cannot possibly come in excess or have its dangers, and which should not be tempered with any other considerations whatsoever.  He actually seems to want those who do not share his vision to be second-class citizens.  Let me point out two spots where the fanaticism of this book is evident.  First, open to 310, where he defines nativism and suggest that one has to be a "denationalized elite" to oppose nativism and then invokes the late historian John Higham.  Look at how Huntington himself characterizes nativism on that page, and see what you think of the implication that anybody who isn't a "denationalized elite" must think nativism is a wonderful thing.  As a bonus, get Higham's actual book, "Strangers in the Land," thumb through it quickly, and get a sense of what tone he actually took about nativism back in 1955.  Second, go back to 270.  Read the sentence referring to historian Cecilia O'Leary and take close notice of the context of the overall paragraph.  Then, get your hands on the piece of hers to which Huntington refers.  It's the chapter she contributed to John Bodnar, ed., "Bonds of Affection."  Read her chapter, reread Huntington's characterization of it, and it should dispel any notions that Huntington makes any serious effort to understand the writings of scholars who don't share his zealotry.  To give a little preview, Huntington gives the impression that O'Leary offers a stridently negative personal attitude about patriotism.  Her piece is actually a historical study of the form that patriotism took in the years from 1865 to 1920.  Huntington is suggesting that she must be unpatriotic to say such things.  Please read her chapter and see if this holds water.  Huntington has been a distinguished scholar longer than I've even been alive.  He has lofty titles at Harvard coming out of his ears, and he has a seemingly daunting list of books and journal articles to his name over the years.  That just makes this book all the more appalling:  his zealotry won out over his intelligence.  He has utterly disgraced himself by writing this book.    If you're reading this, Prof. Huntington, be assured:  you haven't seen the last of my name.  This is just the prelude; I'm working on a much longer critique of your manifesto of intolerance.   
  Fix-it and Forget-It: 5-Ingredient Favorites/ Comforting Slow-Cooker Recipes  By Phyllis Pellman Good  Reviewed by:  Marty Martindale  This is an interesting collection of more than 700 recipes gathered by Good from home cooks all over the country, said to be, "flexible, forgiving and absolutelyt scrumptious." It's a great book for busy young people who've never really learned to cook and need to stick to a budget.   Good has set herself up with firm ground rules for the use of the term, "5 ingredients." First water doesn't count as an ingredient, salt and pepper count for only one, optional ingredients do not count against the 5. Also things "served with" do not count, as well.  She hastens to offer the fuller the slow cooker, the longer the cook time, so also is it this way with densely-packed contents and large chunks.   Each recipe has a heading which includes home cook's name, number of servings, preparation time, cooking time and ideal slow cooker size for amounts given.   *	Mountain Bike Soup:  Chicken broth, V/8, barley, pepperoni and green beans  *	Chili-Taco Soup:  Stew meat, stewed tomatoes, taco seasoning mix, pinto beans and whole-kernel corn  *	Greek Chicken Pita Filling:  Chopped onion, chicken thighs, lemon pepper, oregano and yogurt  *	No-Peeking Beef Tips:  Stew meat, onion soup mix, lemon-lime soda and cream of mushroom soup  *	Reuben Casseroled:  Corned beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, Thousand Island dressing and stuffing mix  *	Fruity Meatballs:  Frozen meatballs, brown sugar and crushed pineapple with its juice  *	Pork and Sweet Potatoes:  Loin chops, Salt and pepper, sweet potatoes, onions and apple cider  *	Tangy Port Tenderloin:  Add honey, Dijon mustard chili powder and salt  *	Creamy Cooker Dinner:  Shredded cheese, uncooked macaroni, milk mushroom soup and cooked meat  *	Corn Pudding:  sugar, cornstarch, beaten eggs, evaporated milk and cream-style corn  *	Flavorful Fruited Rice:  Onion, long-grain rice, chicken broth, dried cranberries and dried apricots  *	Mushrooms in Red Wine:  Garlic, onion, olive oil and red wine.  *	Hot Ground Beef Dip:  Beef, Velveeta, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce and diced green pepper  *	Mexican Cheese Dip:  Velveeta, taco seasoning and canned tomatoes with green chilies  *	Revved-Up Chili Dip:  Salsa, canned chili with beans, ripe olives and American cheese  *	Peanut Butter Cake:  Yellow cake mix, crunchy peanut butter and water  *	Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding:  skim milk, long-grain rice, sugar, salt, melted butter and raisins     
 Worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed.  I'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it's impossible to make a waffle that doesn't stick completely to the waffle iron.  A complete waste of money 
 I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.  This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's "One Bullet Away."  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.  You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a "human side" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in "One Bullet."  There is no connection between author and reader in "Shooter."  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In "One Bullet" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.  To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.  The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.  Overall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them 
 I couldn't tell if I liked the book while I was reading it, so I decided to finish it. I'm still not sure. I think the only reason I liked it at all, was because I wanted to. It's a topic I like, but it didn't really  deliver.  With all the books out there, and only so much time to live, I am  -sure- there are better to choose from 
 Too many pretty pictures and not enough information to really understand the essence of San Francisco. I didn't think this book was worth the money 
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 Man you know this duo is bad when the paperback book costs more than the DVD. They tried to make me read this pile of trash but i couldn''t even get passed the first page without falling asleep and wating to burn myself alive 
 This diet makes you feel weak, it makes you feel light headed, and it makes you hate fruit with a PASSION. Why don't you try eating only watermelon or grapes for a day and tell me how YOU feel...along with all of the other days being mostly acidic fruits that cause ulcers and the corners of your mouth to be raw from the juice. It makes you have diarrhea and stomach pains, and I'm sorry but NO AMOUNT of weight makes that ok. It's the diet of a compulsive eater and a bulimic, and I can't believe I bought into this diet. Ask any health expert, and they will tell you to stay away. You might as well fast like an anerexic , binge like a compulsive eater, and purge yourself of the food through taking exlax...it will have the same effect.. I am SO GROSSED OUT BY THIS DIET!PLEASE don't do this to yourself..I know you may see this and think...she just screwed up the diet and is mad at herself for it and is taking it out on the diet...I am not doing that, and I just don't want anyone to do this to themselves..I was reading a blog from someone who said that she got a severe condition because of this diet that has stayed with her for over a year now...Don't do this to yourself..I don't care how good fruit is for you...its not good in HUGE amounts and you can't live off of it...find another diet and be healthy 
 I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge.  It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life.  Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all.  Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning.  I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time 
 Ross Gregory Douthat often tells a good story, but ultimately runs into trouble when his assertions, which are nearly never supported with data, turn out to be wrong, as shown by the course of history. Especially noteworthy is the apparent bottom line for the book in which he claims that the gulf between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton was, "far less significant than the angry voices at either end of the spectrum would have one believe." With the murder of at least 200,000 Iraqi citizens, the rejection of Clinton's participation in the Kyoto environmental accords, his focus on intelligent design, his attempts to privatize social security, his corruption in the awarding of no-bid war contracts and Katrina cleanup contracts, and his desire to have the government intrude on all aspects of our personal lives, Bush has proven himself to be as far apart from Clinton as possible, with deadly results. Clinton was a compromiser who worked with people., Bush never compromises, and listens to no one. Douthat further cuts on the "liberal" Harvardians who protested for a living wage for janitors on the campus, then after poking fun at their hair and presumed bathing habits, admits that they were correct to fight the good fight. He goes through college largely consumed with partying, booze, girls, frats (Harvard equivalent), and avoiding classwork, then rails against those who go to college to party, drink, chase girls (or boys) and join frats. IN SUMMARY, Douthat gets angry with the world that he eagerly embraces, blaming everyone but himself for the world condition and the condition at Harvard. He can dish it out, but he takes no personal responsibility for helping anyone else. "Me First" should have been the title of the book. In that sense, the book is a perfect reflection of his stated political views. Funny thing is, he writes wonderful articles in  The Atlantic, to which I have subscribed for many years 
 You don't need Theomatics to prove GOD exists,just get on your knees and experience Him!That you can't do with Theomatics.Like the man before the great white throne judgement,Who says, "I'm sorry GOD I cant go to HELL Your theomatic numbers are wrong" The time frame in which we live was made very clear by Paul,in the book of Ephesians 1:1-14 The Father is calling out His sons whom He predestinated before the destruction of the world (foundation)in Christ Jesus to be like His only begotten Son Jesus,Who will be called home before the rapture of the church Phil 3:14. because they are not of this world,Jn 8:23.and theirs more much more but because of space I cant go into it here 
 I'm sorry to those who apparently loved this book, but I didn't! I thought it was awful how he strung sentences together, using commas, so that 7  sentences would become 1, making a paragraph!  He was not a good author,  and I definitly didn't need to hear about "The Time In the Life Of A  Hormonally Charged Boy"!  All in all it was a complete waste of time,  so don't read it! = 
 I just wanted to point out that I own this book too; and that I share the sentiments of the other reviewer 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 I recently read a book, In the Middle, by Nancie Atwell. In her book, Mrs. Atwell highly suggested having The Beans of Egypt, Maine as part of one's classroom library. Being a junior high English teacher as well, I looked forward to the possibility of having another book to present to my students. I have never been so mortified. I could never present such a book to my students with a clear conscience. The language is appalling and the adult situations are not suitable for their impressionable minds. Thinking of my students as I read, I was disgusted and in disbelief that this was considered excellent literature for 12-14-year-olds 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I didn't find the book justified its cover price as I didn't feel the author wrote this to help franchisees although he had some sage advice. Instead, the author has worked for Franchisors and he has that mindset. The reader should know that up front and take what he has to say with a grain of salt.   Teixeira dangerously explains how to negotiate less significant areas of the franchise agreement such as renewal terms while justifying the franchisor's position not to negotiate other CRITICAL aspects such as termination clauses. This can trap unsuspecting franchisees in a system of indentured servitude for the term of the contract even though the franchisor breaches the contract! Amazingly, to top this off, the author admits never taking a franchisee's house through litigation while implying he was justified to take everything else of value.   He also fleetingly mentions that franchisees should expect to accrue equity in their franchise operation from the many years of building the business but it is well known that franchisors often won't allow that to happen. In fact, the author devotes some pages explaining how the franchisor may buy the business for below market value and is justified in doing so.   In addition, he doesn't differentiate business format franchises from product franchises (e.g. distribution franchises for Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, Budweiser, etc). He discusses how franchisees should expect the franchisor provide what they are obligated to provide in return for 5-7% royalty payments. This makes it sound like the franchisee receives a recurring tangible product or service from the franchisor when they do not. In fact, the majority of franchisors merely provide trademark licensing and a process of closing a sale. As can be expected, many franchisees of these business format franchise systems become disillusioned very quickly.   In order to fairly balance the decision making process, any prospective franchisee owes it to themselves to buy the Purvin book called Franchise Fraud. You won't get that balance from the Teixeira book alone. 
 I bought these things because I really hate silverfish in my apartment. Before I used them I only found silverfish in my bathroom. At first I put a big one (for large room) in the living room and one week later I found a silverfish on the wall just 1 foot distance from this repeller. After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom.  Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen. But I still found silverfish in my bedroom and bathroom, and living room, but no one in the kitchen until now. Hmm, now I think these stupid things are just night lights. 
 The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.  Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one 
 I was so disappointed with the language in this book.  I had heard about it on the NPR "Splendid Table" show and looked forward to reading it.  What a waste of good money.  I can't get past the first 30 pages because of the filthy language.  I was insulted to have squandered money on filth.  If Mario Batali can't open his mouth with every other word beginning with "f", I certainly wouldn't want to eat his food as it must be as filthy as his language.  Wish I could get a refund 
 I'm embarrassed that I own this book.  This book will actually lower your IQ.  Along the way it will also teach you to hate Communists, Catholics, and basically anyone else in the world who does not share in his overly opinionated perspective (on an issue that should be left open to interpretation to begin with).  Please, do not help Lahaye make any more money off of this.  He has already made a mockery out of scholarly end times study with his whole Left Behind farce 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  It was sorely lacking in content, mostly it was like reading a big ad for a single model of DCC equipment.  I was looking for something which would give more than a general overview of the DCC system.  Coverage on the accessory DCC capable options would have been nice.  After getting this book I had to still go to the internet and research; this book should have been my reference.   I would suggest that you wait until version 2 or maybe 3 of this book before buying it, maybe then they might even add a table for the CV values and what they mean for a decoder 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 This is the most ugly thing I've ever seen in my life. Feels like plastic. I hate it. My boyfriend bought it for his friend, he will probably be returning it. WAY too expensive for the quality of this thing 
 As a profesional investment writer and editor myself, maybe I am fussy, but I couldn't believe how badly put together this book was.  Nice idea for a book though:  in the words of John Templeton, "There's always a bull market SOMEWHERE."   The authors' thesis in Bull Hunter is that, for the next decade or so at least, that bull market won't be in US stocks.  Maybe so. And, some good alternatives are offered for consideration.  However, I found the book badly written and repetitve.  It could have benefitted tremendously from being properly edited.  Then I might not have become dizzy from going round in circles as I read.    All in all, a disappointment 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
 Bridget FOnda at her best performance? Guy, this is a lousy picture, where everything is wrong: the director seems to don't know what to do with the weak script he had in its hands; Sutherland and Ann-Miller seems to be  working to pay their bills, only; and Bridget confused the order to act  like a deaf woman and acted as a sleepy girl all movie long !  Every minute  watching this pocture was wasted, but I rented it because of the cast. Sad  mistake.. 
 Good if you've already familiar with Control Systems.  It skips some parts as detailing in Mathematical Foundation and goes straight to the subject that you want to know. Comes with a CD with a very handy Mathlab program to solve Transfer Functions,etc. However, you have to download the Appendixes from the internet, because contrary to what it says, there are no appendixes on the included CD, only the Mathlab program. But it is a good book for post-graduate students and engineers 
 A dance mix that begins with a slow groove by Cat Stevens? This is not a best of Danny Tenaglia mixes, it's a best of Danny Tenaglia's favorite dance tracks, from over 3 decades. He mixes and segues the varying style quite well, but this stuff just isn't a great house party.Some scratching and popping is noticed on a few of the records he spins as well (after all, some of the records are probably nearly 20 years old) It does include some big names in dance music-Mr. Lee, Nomad, Two Tons o Fun, Adeva, Frankie Knuckles, Jomanda, but do expect for the styles to be over the map. Track times are:  CD1:   1) was dog a doughnut (4:13) 2) changes (6:51) 3) shine (7:01) 4) as one (4:55) 5) love me forever or love me not (6:25) 6) I believe (7:20) 7) not gonna do it (7:59) 8) I can't forget (5:05) 9) I Wanna Give you Devotion (6:27) 10) Make it Right (5:03) 11) elevation (7:03) 12) just us (4:54)  CD2:  1) outta limits (4:29) 2) on the floor 7:40) 3) don't go lose it baby (7:39) 4) give me your love (6:44) 5) independent woman (5:58) 6) rushin (7:42) 7) the whistle song (8:15) 8) I want to thank you (4:31) 9) por favor (1:16) 10) make my body rock (6:27 
 I Love Trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions. It is effectively a vehicle for everyone's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s, Julia Roberts, to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by Nick Nolte.  Nolte plays Peter Brackett, a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected Chicago Chronicle.  Ever the ladies man, Brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts, his loyal readers, and even his grumpy editor. He manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time, every time (even if it does mean plagiarising himself!). Having just released a novel, Brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit, and life is looking good for this charming, yet slightly sleazy bachelor. This is of course until journalistic competition, in the form of the lovely Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), comes along with her quick wit, sharpened pencil, keen nose for a story, and obligatory short skirt. In the end, this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably 30 minutes too late in arriving. The actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads, which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clichéd one-liners. There are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story, some wide enough to fit Julia Roberts' smile through sideways, and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios. If it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s, it failed miserably.  
 The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to "The Bourne Identity." He lost his character!  He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in "The Bourne Identity."   This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it.  I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal  There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.    I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish. 
 I am currently in an ethics class and this book was required for the course. This is by far the most repetitive and useless book you will ever use in your entire life. NO JOKE. It offers no insight into things that you dont already know. It simply takes what you already know, puts it into fancier words, and spits it right back at you. If this book is not a requirement for a class then dont waste your money. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go throw this peice of crap in a volcano and forget I was ever plagued by its stupidity and uselessness 
 I consider myself a pretty hardcore Disney fan. As an adult with no children I usually buy this sort of thing for myself and I enjoy it tremendously.  I'll be honest here, while I do purchase almost all of the music I own, I will sample music via "shared" MP3s online from time to time. Especially with Disney now a days, the Princess franchise hits all kinds of highs and lows. There is no guarantee anymore that Disney automatically equals quality. I found a webpage online that enabled me to sample the first 8 tracks of this album in their entirety. I dodged a bullet here. Obviously some of the original princess voices actors are no longer living, and that's not to beheld against this album. In past sequel films they've made some decent replacement choices. However I didn't think they did a good job here.    Snow White's singing is horribly grating and Cinderella's isn't much better. In many songs they try and include all the background characters, like the 7 dwarfs and Cinderella's mice but they aren't the original voices either. I don't see why they chose to put in sub-par replacements of secondary characters when they didn't really have to. You might not notice Snow White isn't the original, and that won't detract from the album,  but you're going to notice the 7 dwarfs are way off the mark once they join in. Etc. This album would have been MUCH better if they had just gone with a more classical one character approach, rather then try and cram handfuls of what is unnecessary poor voice work into each song.    They couldn't even get some of the living princess voice actors to sign on which I feel says something about the product. Paige O'Hara, who was the voice of Belle in the original Disney film, is ~not~ on this album. She was replaced by Susan Egan who played the original Belle on Broadway. Egan does have an excellent voice and makes an excellent Belle anyway, but she is not the original. (Coincidentally Susan Egan was the voice of "Meg" in Disney's original animated film Hercules and it may further confuse the kiddies about which princess is actually singing in my opinion)    A few tracks with Broadway's "Belle" and "Pocahontas" are really quite good by themselves, but I'm not willing to pay $10 for ~a few tracks~. From my point of view not many adult Disney fans will find this up to par, and not many parents are going to want to be subjected to Snow White's voice via the listening habits of a toddler who might think this is just great and listen to it over and over.     As far as the celebrities....I seriously doubt a toddler knows or cares who Wayne Brady & Jim Brick man are.     I think you're better off mixing Disney movies and old Christmas favorites like The Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer, or the Grins soundtrack if you're in a Disney/Christmas mood. Or hey, ...break out Mickey's Christmas carol. If you're hell bent on dipping into the Princess franchise pick up one of those "Greatest Hits" Cds Disney has which has a mix of all the popular princess songs from the original films. If you're feeling really frisky many of the voice actors of the contemporary princesses have made their own non-Disney solo albums covering all sorts of kid friendly songs. 
 FALSEHOODS. Spong's most important falsehood is the book's nominal premise--its title. Christianity won't die if it doesn't change. Religions can remain static, or change minimally, and remain viable for millennia. Islam in particular comes to mind.  Relatedly, the theistic God has not been "cast aside" because human beings have "evolved" (p 54). Positing that humans can/do/will evolve either physically or mentally in the space of a few years is an error made by many, including Marx, Lenin, Lysenko and Hegel. Theism developed due to human nature (pp 51-52), and Spong shows no evidence that the mere acquisition of knowledge changes our nature.  INTOLERANCE. For a guy who seeking to "love wastefully and abundantly," (p 68) Spong has a hell of a long way to go. He commits an unpardonable hypocrisy when he calls his critics peddlers of "premodern literalizations that so frequently masquerade as Christianity" (p xvi). Besides being intolerance bordering on bigotry, wouldn't you agree that Spong calling others' Christian credentials into question is a little ironic?  SOPHISTRY. Why does Spong resist being called a pantheist or even a "panentheist" (p 62)? Is there really any difference between "God is in, but not necessarily the sum of, all things" (panenetheism) and "God is the inescapable depth and center of all that is" (Spongism) (p 70)?  And...Christianity without Christ. Think about that. Sam Kinison would have correctly pointed out that Christianity without Christ is like rock 'n roll without drugs. Spong's Jesus is not Christ. He is a "spirit person" (ch 7). He doesn't save (pp 179-180). He didn't atone (p 84). He will not resurrect us (p 116). I could believe an oak tree is Christ; does that make me a Christian?   CASUISTRY. Spong's phony reasoning is obvious when contrasting his religious and political views. Take a look at his view of Jesus and his favorable view of abortion (p 6). In chapter 8 Spong sets forth Jesus as the alpha-exemplar of selflessness and defender of the defenseless and excluded (pp 128-9). Contrast that ideal with abortion. Abortion is almost always selfish; actually, it's difficult to think of something more selfish. It also is an act that by definition rejects (kills) the defenseless.  TRUTH. Let's be honest. Spong breaks wide open some of Christianity's most glaring problems and fallacies. Among the best explained are: how the Enlightenment and modern science attack God (pp 31-40); how the need for religion comes from our nature instead of an external source (pp 51-52); the illogic of "religious truth" (p 52); the function of guilt as part of religious control (p 95); the inherent injustice of prayer (p 142); the immorality of the law of Moses (p 153); and the contemporary selective obedience to biblical laws (pp 156-158) 
 Here's my sincere take on Savage: I think it's mostly an act. Savage understands Biology as a discipline and decided to carve out a niche for himself as the most vitriolic and angry of political commentators. There's just no way a guy could be that angry without having a blood pressure problem so extreme that the pressure he thinks he's under would violate Boyle's Law.  Having said that, how does singling out a section of the population genuinely advance the political debate in this country?  If a person wants to marginalize the political extremes the USA should then go to a parliamentary system of govt., which seems to be what the founding fathers envisioned anyway, before Alexander Hamilton got involved.  For those who doubt my veracity, please read the Articles of Confederation and articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. Our Constitution's major flaw, IMO, is making the prez commander-in-chief, which has allowed our past and current presidents to use the military as their own private police force. Just look at that ginned-up Iraq war were stuck in now. I will say as a former Republican that I'm aghast at the Orwellian nature of the current administration, which seems to be hostile to civil liberties taken for granted in the English speaking world for 900 years. I certainly hope the Supreme Court doesn't uphold a law which makes possible the suspension of Habeas Corpus, especially at the discretion of this president.  We may never get this right back. We didn't seem to need these laws when we fought terrorists in the past.   I'm aware that the book's title is taken from a quote by a Roman senator. But Savage doesn't have a monopoly on Roman quotes. Here's 1 from the Roman historian Tacitus worth considering:   "You have made a desert, and call it Peace." 
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 This would have been an interesting and original view of the problem of persistent poverty in the U.S. had it been published, oh, about thirty or thirty-five years ago.  As it is, it grossly oversimplifies a complex problem, and worse, plays to the cherished superstitions of neoconservative intellectuals and their `lumpen' readers alike.  It will probably come as a great surprise to the author, but I doubt poor black, Hispanic, and hell, even poor white kids have ever even heard of Norman Mailer, much less studied his essays in school.  It may also have escaped the author's attention that inflation whittled the value of payments from programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children down to a fraction of 1960's levels, even factoring in occasional cost-of-living increases-which had all but ceased starting in the 1980's.  Finally, under the impetus of a conservative Congress, the Clinton administration undertook reform of "welfare" in 1996 which included drastically tightening eligibility requirements, placing strict time limits on receipt of benefits, and actively directing recipients into jobs.  Yet poverty seems to persist despite the implementation of conservative nostrums and even more amazingly, despite a near-full employment economy at the end of the 1990's.  In other words, trying to blame everything on kids who grew their hair long in the 1960's, and vapid socialites hobnobbing with Bobby Seale at Leonard Bernstein's soirees forty years ago is not only not right-it isn't even wrong    Meanwhile, since the Nixon administration we have conducted a "War on Drugs" that has stuffed prisons full to bursting with (mostly low level) drug dealers and users-nearly all of them minorities--but accomplished very little else. Although crime rates have in fact dropped to historically low levels, this seems to have little if any correlation with incarceration rates, which have been relentlessly rising since the 1970's.  This decrease in crime, by the way, confounded neoconservative predictions at the beginning of the 1990's that crime-allegedly inspired by our evil culture-would continue spiraling upwards without letup.  Similar decreases occurred in out-of-wedlock births, but as an old saying goes, "A lady's reputation seldom improves."  Especially when she is a member of a racial minority, I might add.  It would seem that the underclass owes very little to the 1960's counterculture, although Encounter Books-once a source of urbane and intelligent works-would probably not have taken Mr. Magnet's manuscript had he concluded as much.  Neoconservatives, it turns out, are as rigidly locked into a mindless party line as the 1960's leftists they criticize.  For example, black social scientists such as Glen Loury and William Julius Wilson were clutched to neoconservative bosoms when their research found that blacks suffered relatively little racial discrimination in hiring compared to past decades.  They were dropped like hot potatoes however when their continued investigations showed that minority unemployment had a lot more to do with factors such as the virtual disappearance of even low-skilled work from most urban areas, and the lack of transportation to exurban areas where most job growth was.  Kind of makes blaming the 1969 Woodstock festival look silly, to say the least.  There is no doubt that there is something that was once called "the culture of poverty" that inculcates some of the poor with self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  This was already old hat by the time "London Labor and London Poor" was published during the Victorian age.  Presumably, the Victorian poor did not become or remain so because of Janet Jackson displaying her bosom on television a century later.  There are innumerable other criticisms to be made of this book starting with its confusion of drug-taking behavior among the poor (which tends to seek oblivion from hopelessness) with middle-class drug taking behavior (which is usually risk-seeking or thrill-seeking), but a complete enumeration of its mistakes, misconceptions, and half-truths would take an essay nearly as long as the book itself.  Suffice it to say that instead of being random, the errors all seem to point in a certain political direction.  Readers may conclude what they will about the author's presumed good faith from this.  Those looking for `just-so-stories' to confirm their darkest prejudices towards racial minorities and justify doing nothing will certainly find what they seek in this book.  Those looking for nuanced discussions aimed at trying to solve problems instead of finding scapegoats will have to look elsewhere 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 A fascinating yarn woven around the idea that Babbage's "difference engine," the precursor to the computer, was put together despite the actual limitations of the time. Using real historical figures-- many of whom are forgotten--Gibson and Sterling depict a London of the 1800s which is heavily polluted and corrupted by "thinking engines." Gibson's style and prose are surprisingly dulled in this collaboration, whereas Sterling's ecological and sociological ideas abound. The work is not for everyone, but whenever you are starved for some original Gibson or Sterling, then give this book a whirl. 
 This book is tired and out of date.  It is time to retire this textbook 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 I thought this was a film about Caouette's mother and her struggles. I thought it was about how she was subjected to electric shocks and maltreatment. I thought I would see a documentary about her life. And what did I see? An extraordinarily self-centered and self-obsessed young man forcing his ego on me. It's all about him, him, him. It seemed more like an exercise in self-display than a film about a serious topic. Stay away from this film 
 For optimal being. one must overcome greed, illusions, and hate, and one must strive to achieve love and compassion.  Sounds interesting but unfortunately this one sentence is virtually all Fromm has to say on the subject.  After stating this, he then warns the reader that he has no intention of discussing the matter any further.  Instead the book is comprised of a series of random thoughts, all very brief, that are only marginally related to the art of being.  When he does elaborate, he merely goes off on a tangent with a quote from Freud or a reference to Marx (his gods).  I found this all rather loathsome.  I can only conclude that people who enjoy reading this drivel must be psychology majors.   This is one of the few books that I threw into the garbage upon reading it.  
 The seller listed a cheap, used library book in place of the book I ordered under the ISBN. A BIG LIE! I was refunded but make sure you are getting what you order!!! 
 I guaranteed that if this were the first James Patterson book I had ever read, I never would have read another.  It feels like it was written by a middle school kid at best - shallow characters, choppy plotline with huge gaping holes, stunted linguistic style.  I couldn't really like or dislike any of the characters, because there was simply nothing to them.  I cannot believe Patterson would put his name on this, or that a publisher would publish it. 
 This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing "scientific" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations.   
 This is a horribly written book, flawed by numerous instruction errors and miserable Quality Control and editing by the publisher. The premise and idea of this series is commendable, but as someone who teaches After Effects and Premiere, this was a sad experiment. I much prefer Adobe's Classroom in a Book, and I generally find much better third party titles than Adobe's. If possible, wait for more titles for the new version 6.5 to come out... authors will have had more time to catch up to the program than this particular volume 
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different.   I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free.  I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe. 
 I wasn't thrilled with the CD, and when I lent it to someone at work the review I got back was "it has no soul". I think that explains it perfectly. It does not, in fact, swing. Set this side by side with the music it was based on, or some of Bireli Lagrene's Gypsy jazz, and it comes up short all the way around. I might have given it two stars, but I feel that the 5-star rating needs to be corrected 
 Is it really worth it? I mean sacrifice your reputation which you worked for 30 years for another million bucks 
  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead. 
 The ones I received wouldn't lock anbd were bent. I need an address to return them and get a refund.  I don't have the receipt. 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 I was very excited about receiving this book, by the way big upps to lupo997 for getting my book to me in a timely fashion.  After reviewing the book further I realized it was like Touched by an Angel, and I don't like that show at all, but I decided to read it anyway cause it looked good.  That was a mistake, the character's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable.  In the first story - Rainmaker - The Professor was sooo in love with Hailey he didn't care about getting killed or putting his own child's life in danger - come on now.  He would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows.  I didn't even read the second story, maybe I'll come back to that.  The third story was totally ridiculous as well.  Paris is so sick of Russell - he doesn't have a job, money and no ambition, yet she stays with him.  He cheats on her, she has the broads up in her house and sells them Mary Kay!!  Yet she stays with him.  He has given her an STD!!!  She stays with him!!!  She doesn't even like making love to him.  During all of this nonsense her fi-one boss is pushing up on her, and she resists.  She won't cheat on her man.  What!!!!  If you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you.  For everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! 
 I have had the Lexar sport drive for 2 years and loved it.  easy to use and worked like a charm until a few months ago, when I began to get messages that told me the drive was full.  Deleting files didn't help and I finally realized that instead of 256 MB of memory, I had about 32 KB.  So something happened along the way and the drive is now useless.  I would not recommend this product 
 the author starts writing about herself.  There were parts of this book that were an absolute joy to read...but eventually, they were marred by the author's relentless self-promotion and conceit.  Reading this, one would  get the idea that Fran Gage single-handedly created the California cuisine  movement.  She mentions landmarks such as Chez Panisse or famous chefs only  to imply that they were influenced by her.  However, when she sets aside  her bias to describe food and cooking, her writing truly comes alive.  An  uneven book, and certainly an exasperating one to get through 
 I have nothing more to say than I've already said in my headline. Lou Dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me.  
 As an English Lit. major in college a MLA Handbook is indispensible, but I was disappointed with this one.  I found it difficult to locate the information I needed, often having to comb several pages to find what I was looking for.  It is just not convenient to use.  I much prefer Diana Hacker's "A Writer's Reference."  The layout of her book is much simpler to navigate, and the spiral binding is always a plus, because it lays open on your desk nicely.   
 This item did not work when I got it.  I returned it to Zelco, who informed me that it was my error, they did not do refunds, and returned it to me.  I had a previous model Zelco that worked great for 10-15 years.  It had a switch.  This new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off.  Gr 
 A very badly written book.  If it wasn't self-published no editor would allow it to be presented in this form. The man has a very poor grasp of our language.  As a man of the sea he shows himself to be the greatest WIMP of all times.  I'm very sorry I spent money and time on this "magazine" 
 I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.  For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.    
 I have had this textbook now for 3 years.  Sure it contains the basics, but it is now rather out of date, with a bad lay-out.  As a university student I have found it the most useless of all of the 12 marketing textbooks that I own 
 Sorry but I hated this movie, and before someone assumes I'm just some little mambie pambie wimp who doesn't like horror movies, I like them a lot but I just didn't like this movie, and that is because I think it is one of the stinkiest horror movies I ever watched, it is a stupid movie and Jamie Lee Curtis can and has done much better! 
 Despite my high hopes for this book and the fact that Mr. Epharums is a talented photographer and print maker, and I trust had the best of intentions, this book is just not very good. The approach the author takes is inconsistent and confusing: at times he's rambling when you want simplicity and clarity; at other times he's sparse when you're hoping for detail.   For starters, the sections covering how to work with Photoshop are not very clear. And the figures and much of the text are so painfully small that they're almost useless. This is especially obvious when he covers duotones. I like what he's achieved, but he doesn't give much to learn from.   In another part of the book he offers his "guiding principles," a series of one-liners that I assume are supposed to convey a Zen-like teaching about his approach. Instead they left me baffled. Consider the phrase "A precision of feeling." It sounds nice, but what does it mean, (speaking of precision)? Or the phrase "Let the accident participate" which is accompanied by photos of boats beached at low tide. Again I was baffled: does he mean an accident in something he did in taking the photo or in working on it in Photoshop, or did he mean the "accident" of the beached boats (which were beached on purpose)? Again, a nice Zen-like sentiment (and believe me, I can get down and cosmic with the best of them), but not useful in learning about photography or about digital black and white image-making.   This touches on the essence of what's wrong with this book. It is trying to be both a guide to digital black and white printmaking and at the same time, a book about Mr. Epharums' approach and philosophy to image-making. Not that this can't be pulled off, only that he doesn't do it in this book.   I think that this book could have worked, if the author had partnered with a good Photoshop teacher, and if he had worked with a compassionate but ruthless editor, to keep the book on track and the ramblings at bay, and if he was committed to clear examples of how to make these types of images. But that's a lot of if-ing on my part.   What redeems this book somewhat are the images: they are wonderful, and do give one inspiration as to what is possible with digital image-making; just don't look to this book to show you how.   Regards, Davi 
 As a student starting law school I thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class, boy was  wrong... The book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student. It is however, very basic in its approach and gives you a good start, so it is not a total waste.., The subtitle says that the book is for "non-lawyers", as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun. my recomendation is, that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book, but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer, trust me it is well worth the fees. Among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list, in the case of Lexis-Nexis and West Law require very expensive memberships and that most Law Schools restrict the use of their Law Library to students in their Law School and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the Law Library, as the Law Students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the Library and Legal Librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome.    
 DJ, Producer, Musician, Writer, artist, and Filmmaker(ha) is often called a Renaissance man.  Well Mr. Spooky just because you own final cut pro doesn't make you a filmmaker and just because you own protools does not make you a musician.  This is the worst of Spooky's many failures!  Time to pick a career and devout your life to it instead of all this haphazard look I do everything just not very well nonsense.  If you want to be a musician, be a musician. You can still do those other things, They're called hobbies.  
 This book could have had half the number of pages. The focus is on the spiritual (indian?) side of Larry. It does paint an interesting picture of what he was like, but I found the comments of other builders in Art of the Chopper II more relevant. The recurring theme of life's mysteries and how they influenced Larry went on and on. It became a bit much. Nearly ruined a reasonable read 
 there is only one asimov.. and only one douglas adams (who in my opinion is not really all that funny and definitely not in the same league as asimov)  but terry pratchet is neither and he is trying just too hard to be funny.  or my tolerance for fiction has gone down over the year.. 
 I thought this book was about the rivers themselves--perhaps she had floated these rivers and was writing about the sights and scenes.  My mistake.  The essays are very well done and I appreciate her sincerity and insights. Although there is not a description of the Brazos River in the essay about the Brazos. I enjoyed the human interest but was left wondering how the daughter's relationship turned out! 
 I have all of her previous books and I have to admit that I am getting a little tired of her cookbooks. I have used her first two books numerous times and the recipes are no fail. However, with the more recent ones and especially this last one, I am beginning to fill that her repertoire needs some refreshing. There is nothing new and exciting here and I have encountered and excecuted extremely close version of these recipes from a number of other chefs/cookbook writers. Let us hope for something better in the future 
 this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America! 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 The author makes some very good points in this book, but after a while it becomes difficult to separate fact from fiction.  I wasn't aware, for instance that "...the venom of all other poisonous snakes attacks the blood whereas the venom of the puff adder attacks the nervous system..." (page 302 paperback edition).  Really?  I thought there were many species of snakes that had neurotoxin venom, but what do I know?  I'm just a scientist.  But he doesn't stop there.  He goes on to tell a tear-jerking tale about an incident with General George Patton wherein he describes Patton's voice as "low and rasping".  Sorry, but that was George C. Scott.  As a matter of actual fact, General Patton was very self-conscious of his rather high-pitched reedy voice.  And where in the world did this man who claims to have made multiple visits to Italy come up with the idea that there are no protestant churches (or any other religions for that matter) in that country?  Unfortunately, this work is rife with  such fabrications and delusions.  And then there are the quotes -- either he has an unparalled power of recall or he greatly embellishes many lengthly quotes.  After a while, this work begins to take on the characterists of a quasi-religious "Forrest Gump".  Perhaps some day a good biography of John Paul I will be written, but this one is definitely not it. 
 My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well 
 Miller rates a par for the book (if that's damning by faint praise, so be it) but the ghost writer, editor, and publisher should get a DQ (disqualified) for the effort. The misprints, factual errors, bad grammar, and typos detract to the point of cancelling out anything good Miller says. I wanted to like this book because Miller himself is so likeable and his TV commentary is so good,but thanks to the poor production value it's as hard to enjoy as a triple bogey. For instance,two questions: did Seve win three times on the PGA tour(pg 202)or six times(pg 203)? And how do you hit a ball with the clubshaft perpendicular to the ground? To do that, it would have to be dangling from your hands like a plumb bob. Maybe Johnny can demonstrate that during the rain delay at the British Open 
 The sound is nice, but I prefer many tracks on a CD rather than one long sound. I find it gets monotonous...not sleepy, but tedious....too long 
 Waller, why are you writing this stuff?  You're an elderly gent, retired I assume, who made a bundle off the sugary-sweet and sappy BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.  Take the big money you made  and run brother--quit demonstrating your literary nincompoopismo! 
 Roger MacDonald's book as published in the United States is entitled The Man in the Iron Mask.  He traces the history of the real D'Artagnan who arrived in Paris in 1640 to enter history.  MacDonald shows that not only did D'Artagnan really exist but so did Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  And some of the material in the novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas actually happened under different circumstances.  MacDonald, despite his claims to be the first researcher to find this, joins a line of authors who have traced this story before.  MacDonald's major difference is that he uses information in the pseudo-memoirs of D'Artagnan to guide his research.  These pseudo-memoirs, which Dumas claims as his source for the novel, were actually written by Gatien Courtilz de Sandras and published in 1700 or 27 years after everyone believe D'Artagnan had died.  Courtilz de Sandras served in the French army in the 1660s and may even have been a musketeer.  In any case, he knew D'Artagnan whose reputation was kingdom-wide.  MacDonald claims, without one shred of evidence, that D'Artagnan did not die from his wounds at the siege of Maastrich in June 1673.  Instead his wounded body was taken into custody and his enemies at court and in the musketeers plotted to hide this fact from the king.  D'Artagnan, says MacDonald, was really the man in the iron mask.  This would make a great movie, even though it is completely false history.  The effort to identify the man in the iron mask has produced more than 1000 articles and books since that unfortunate prisoner excited the interest of Voltaire in the eighteenth century.  Yes, Virginia, there was a masked prisoner whose fate inspired so many authors.  His mask was not made of iron, but he existed according to some evidence that cannot be discounted.  He accompanied Benigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars in September 1698 when the latter arrived to take his post as governor of the Bastille.  The journal of Saint-Mars' second-in-command records his arrival saying that he had been Saint-Mars' prisoner since the latter was at Pignerol but no one was allowed to know his name.  The same journal reports that the prisoner who wore a black velvet mask died on 19 November 1703.  Researchers have probed the correspondence between Saint-Mars and his boss, the war minister Louvois, to try to identify this masked prisoner.  Books proliferate in French but MacDonald has added his guesstimation to the shorter list of books in English.  MacDonald is the first author to identify D'Artagnan as the masked prisoner.  Unfortunately, MacDonald surmises without proof, discounts or ignores evidence that is inconvenient to his thesis, and plays on the willful gullibility of his reader.  For example, although MacDonald tells us that Saint-Mars had orders to kill the masked prisoner should he talk to anyone or attempt to communicate, he guesses that the former soldier and musketeer Courtilz de Sandras who was imprisoned in the Bastille from 1693 to 1699, probably had conversations with the masked prisoner.  These conversations inspired Courtilz to compose his pseudo-memoirs in 1700.  The pseudo-memoirs talk about things that happened in D'Artagnan's youth and his years in the musketeers but fail to mention that he has spent 27 years as a prisoner wearing a mask.  While Courtilz might have been afraid to mention that fact in print, there is no proof that he ever talked about it to anybody.  Unfortunately, MacDonald conveniently omits the probability that Saint-Mars, who was also a former musketeer and companion of D'Artagnan's, might have spoken with Courtilz de Sandras about things that happened while they were both serving in the French army, i.e., with D'Artagnan.  Saint-Mars was known to entertain his prisoners, especially those with connections.  The Bastille was a prison that specialized in prisoners from the uppercrust of French society.  MacDonald spurns using footnotes saying that footnoting is an art that discounts the value of the evidence.  Instead, he has a whole chapter discussing the general sources he used in each chapter of the book.  This is a convenient way to prevent anyone from following his research.  The best book on this subject is in French by Jean-Christian Petitfils entitled Le Masque de fer.  The best book in English is by John Noone entitled The Man Behind the Iron Mask.  I hesitate to mention good books in a review of such a shoddy piece of work as MacDonald's.  I gave him two stars because it was a fun read, but I got bored with him at the end because he was piling one guess on top of another with little to prove anything.  He even goes so far as to say that the masked prisoner did not die on 19 November 1703 as so many believe but lived on until 1711.  Again, he provides no proof for any of this. 
 I don't like the stones. they are overrated and don't make good music. I only like their 2 good songs in start me up, and shattered and that's it. other than that, don't buy any other rolling stones cd who are terrible. Thanks 
 I bought this in November and used it a couple times. It worked on one disk and not the other. I went to use it again and it stopped working. I then called Maxell and it only has a 90 warranty. So I am feeling ripped off and angry. Oh well, that'll teach me to buy Maxell anything 
 This is truly an execrable book, and Barron's should be ashamed to have published it. Not only is it poorly written and misleading in some of its conclusions, it is riddled with factual errors. Some of these errors may be blamed on the confusing charts (ex: the chart on page 22 seems to indicate that the Hopi and Navajo lived in New England while the Chinook inhabited Texas and the Pequot, Mohegan, and Naragansett hung out in Florida), while others are relatively minor (ex: page 44, the lawyer in the John Peter Zenger trial was Andrew Hamilton, not Alexander Hamilton).  Other "errors" can be described more accurately as "glaring misunderstandings and lapses of historical fact." My favorite of these occurs on pages 120 and 121, when the author goes on at length about how John Brown's experiences "as a slave" led him to organize the attack on the federal armory at Harper's Ferry. There is a little box with a quote from the memoirs of a Georgia slave named John Brown talking about the harsh conditions of his life before his escape. This is immediately followed by this paragraph:  "John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry proved to be a catlyst for war. He was arrested, tried and hanged. When you look at the diary entry, you will see the agony that Brown went through as a slave. It is not surprising that when he escaped, he decided to lead the attack. You must take this suffering into account in deciding what you would have done if you were John Brown."  Of course, John Brown was not a slave. He was a white abolitionist/violent revolutionary. Amazingly enough, there must have been more than one person named John Brown living in America in the 1850s!  It really is amazing to me that Barron's, which I have generally found to be a reputable company, would let such a book carry the Barron's name into the market. I have the 1999 edition, and it is my fervent hope that there are no subsequent editions. If there are, I hope that someone has gotten around to editing the thing.   The only way I could possibly recommend this book is if it were to a bored history teacher who wanted to exercise his or her red pen a little.   
 This 1971 offering stars Giancarlo Giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison-dipped needle before eviscerating them.    The production is above average slick and the performances are fine, especially from Giannini, but I just didn't find it involving, suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward.  It's not bad, just average.  The climax and the killer's unmasking is particularly weak and anti-climactic.  Fans of the genre seem to really like this one, but I suggest a rental before a purchase 
 Arthur Seldon uses Abraham Lincoln as an example of a leader who believed in limited government, "of the people, by the people, and for the people".  In actuality, Lincoln lead a failed government attempt at state railroad building when he was in the Illinois legislature.  He instituted the first conscription in the United States, and the first income tax.  He lead the charge of an unconstitutional export tax on Southern cotton and then an actual blockade.  He intimidated the Supreme Court and executed Union soldiers for sleeping on duty.  Seldon should do a bit of reading about Lincoln before he uses him as an icon for small government.  I, personally, was so turned off by the introduction that I couldn't bring myself to read the book 
 This is a presentation of the possible events that will usher in the reign of the Antichrist.  Key event is a worldwide financial crisis and desperate people in need of a solution.  The solution will be offered by a group of  conspirators, or "money masters."  Countries will no longer have  individual currencies, but a one-world currency will be initiated.       Some of the theories presented involve timelines which have about expired,  there is repetition in thought and ideas, and some of the ideas presented  seem extreme.  Still, it is not possible to dismiss all of the book as  lunacy, and a few of the ideas stick in the mind and raise questions about  what is happening in the world of today and in the United States 
 All too often when consumers run across an interesting movie that they have never heard of before, they make the decision to buy or rent it based on the packaging instead of writing down the name of the show and then looking up reviews for it. This approach makes consumers the playthings of unscrupulous marketers. One such company is Anchor Bay Entertainment that this summer released a 1988 flick called "The Dead Next Door" on DVD. The packaging for this DVD touted this movie as being a lost horror classic that has now resurfaced. In fact, its labelled a "Collector's Edition" and a "Making Of" documentary is added to the DVD. Such are the lengths that Anchor Bay has gone to in order to deceive uninformed customers.  The marketing claims are only partly right. The Dead Next Door really is a "lost" horror flick that has been out of sight (not even on cable television) since it was originally released in 1988. However, it is not a classic, unless you consider poorly made features to be "classics" in their own right. Think of a latter day Ed Wood type production made with even less talent than found in Ed Wood's movies.   The Dead Next Door was the brainchild of an Akron, Ohio teenager named J.R. Bookwalter who somehow persuaded Hollywood movie maker Sam Raimi to put up the financing for a flick to be shot on Super 8. In gratitude, Bookwalter named the lead role "Raimi" and one of the lesser roles "Dr. Savini" after Sam Raimi associate Tom Savini. The name of the evil cult leader is named Rev. Jones in honor of the real life Rev. Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown mass suicide in 1978. How original.  The Dead Next Door is a good example of what happens when a teenager with no real movie making experience is given a miniscule budget to make a feature length flick. Abandoned houses, and a high school serve unconvincingly as high tech labs, government offices and as a headquarters for a zombie cult. The plot is completely unimaginative, the acting is just plain awful, and the original actors voices have been clumsily dubbed back in and sound completely wooden. While watching this, you will find yourself frequently looking at your watch even though the flick is only 84 minutes long.  As with the case of so many of today's Shot on Video (SoV) horror flicks, The Dead Next Door comes off looking really cheap and gives the impression of having been just thrown together over the weekend in hopes of cashing in on cool box art, an intriguing title and gullible movie fans. And with good reason since The Dead Next Door was shot in just a few days and comes across as a cheapjack production that was made in haste and with but little talent.  The Dead Next Door is a horror flick that is so bad that it is bad. In both this flick and in subsequent productions, J.R. Bookwalter shows the lack of an eye for detail and total unoriginality that has resulted in his name being mud among knowledgeable horror flick fans.  In any event, The Dead Next Door is a waste of both your time and money no matter how low a price you can  get it for 
 I just could not wait to get my hands on this book, which made the read all the more disappointing.  Basically, Technical Diving in Depth is a poorly organized mishmash of Dr. Wienke's ground breaking published scientific work pulled together with a smattering of useful diving information to make a book.  It also includes a lot of material almost completely irrelevant to diving such as a chapter on "Gravitation and Solar Radiation"; there is even a section on rotational precession, but the real gem is the section on stellar evolution.  Yeah, I always ponder stellar evolution 80 feet down on a steep coral wall.  Much of the material in the latter part of the book is a grab-bag of the basic knowledge one would acquire in the course of a obtaining a bachelors degree the physical sciences presented in Reader's Digest form.  Is Dr. Wienke trying to impress us with equations, does he think he is writing a comprehensive physics book?  He accomplishes neither.  Several previous reviewers have conjectured that they could not understand the material because it is too hard and Dr. Wieke is so much smarter than they are.  No - the material is just presented badly.  A good scientist can communicate complex ideas to any reasonably intelligent person if they try (e.g. Henry Bent's `The Second Law' and anything written by Richard Feynman).  That is what a teacher does.  One of the most striking examples of the complete lack of organization of this book occurs right off the bat.  There is a section on the First and Second Law of Thermodynamics but it comes after the presentation of the Ideal Gas Laws.  WHAT?  How could a physicist do this?  Well easy, Dr. Wienke makes no effort to establish the relationship between the laws of thermodynamics and the gas laws which he should know are quite sequitur.  He is just regurgitating material helter-skelter out of his old first year physics books.  If the good reader wishes to learn basic physics, my old copy of Halliday and Resnick is a much better resource.  And please do not try to learn any chemistry from this book, a couple of the equations are just plain wrong.  But the sin of sins is that little of the technical material is ever related to practical aspects of scuba diving - there are few examples and no effort is spent on providing anyone who does not already know the science any sense of relevance.  Gas Laws and indeed any of the concepts in this book would be easy to teach in the context of diving (even the equations) because all the available examples are practical, visual and relate directly to diving safety; you will find none of that here.   Dr. Wienke is responsible for much of the research leading to the algorithms used in dive computers to estimate the extent of tissue saturation of breathable gasses under pressure - extremely admirable and useful work.  His work has changed diving much for the better.  I bought the book looking for just this work (only to later find it all on the web).  But even here, he does not come out and clearly explain the physical and biological problems or the mathematical approximations.  The equations ramble about almost oblivious to each other and the reader.  It made me wonder if the obfuscation was just careless writing or intentional.  It also made me wonder if some of the previous reviewers were afraid to say that the emperor wears no cloths.  In any event, I concluded that the book's editor had to be just too intimidated by the material to make any useful contribution to the final work.  No one around Dr. Wienke knew enough about what he was trying to say to be able to tell him the book was a mess.    It appears that Dr. Wienke wrote this book as a text for a course in advanced technical diving.  I suppose the book could serve that purpose but only to a very select group of students and much of the material would waste their time.  So this book has no real audience.  The technical material is beyond anyone without the background in physics, chemistry or engineering that would give them access to the math and such technical folk will find much of the material a poor reflection of that which they are already familiar.  Scientists should look for Dr. Wienke valuable contributions to diving science on the web and in the scientific literature.  Non-technical folk should continue toward more advanced diving certification through approved courses.  And I'm out 58 bucks plus shipping. 
 The Incredibles is a totally stupid animated film.  The story is stupid, the voiceover stupid, the whole thing stupid 
 I love Dr. Rosenfield, but this is a useless book. Sorry, doc 
 This magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year, meaning most reviews prior to April 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine.  I was a subscriber since the early 90's and have recently cancelled.  This magazine had a mid (end of life?) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity.  And cars!  Why would I pick up PC Magazine to read a car review?  Their "improved" layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and "cool" sayings to replace actual review content.  What is their market here?  12 year old geeks with an extra $80k laying around to drop on an SUV?  Get real.  Until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic, it is best avoided 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 The A1A Album includes "God's Own Drunk" and this is not included on the CD with the same title.  How did this happen?  We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here 
 I found this item to be equal to the Conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money 
 There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut "I'll Be There" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.  Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.  The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.  "I'll Be There" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because "I'll Be There" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.  With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills.   The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.  Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. "I'll Be There," but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can 
 If you wish to remain in that happy blissful world of suspended disbelief, where fairy stories continue to charm and inspire, and heroes are held sacred, then by all means never read this book.  "He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes, and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing." Gospel of John: 9: 6-7.  The intended audience of this work: the permanently cynical (me), writers, and English Literature undergraduates. For undergrads: after mentioning Foucault you quote Polti's structural plot diagnostic in some obfuscated sentence in about your third paragraph of any lit paper and you're on your way to graduating with honors. Heck, you professor won't even read any further and just slap an "A" on the darn thing. For writers: if you are stuck, reading this will send you screaming back to your alphanumeric clavichord faster than a Mustang with a tank full of white lightening and jet fuel.  One of the horrible things about reviewing is you start to think about what you've seen and read. Given man's continued Aristotelian imperative to classify, we also begin to classify written and visual literature. Soon this is distilled to an essence, and soon you read the essence instead of the story. Or the familiar story is re-written in a disguised way, and with such excellent selection of language, you don't care.  Georges Polti made things even worse than Aristotle did, and now there are no new stories under the sun. Instead of a Novel-O-Matic or "Mad-Lib: The Novel" we have Polti's "The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations." Read this and you need never read again, but will always just flip to this most essential of the "Master Plots."  Why 36? Why not. Nice factoring on that handy number, sounds plausible, and didn't Jesus die at 36 years old? Or was it 33? Aren't there "Form Critics" and deconstructionists who hold the Gospels out to be the first novels? Polti hesitates not 
 I researched what is available on the market, and this router had all the features I wanted - MAC filtering, WPA password protection,  54 Mbps, can be used as a switch, works with PC and Mac. Trendware offered a nice rebate too. All this is great but when there is a wall between my PowerBook and the router, the reception drops a lot, and sometimes completely. It only works well when they are in the same room. This could be due to the fact that there are other wireless networks around which interfere with mine. I don't know. I thought I would give heads up for those looking for a reliable router. 
 When I saw this show in my local store I jumped right in and bought it. I expected an intelligent and entertaining show. I loved the movie Rounders and I thought this show might live up to it's potential, sadly that it not the case. This really could have been a great show, but it's just chewing gum for the brain. If you liked Rounders and like poker don't buy this as you'll be disapointed.  
 I was disappointed in several aspects of this DVD. First of all, if you are an avid Martha-on-TV watcher, you have probably seen most of these segments. Secondly, the cake on the case front is not shown or demonstrated on the DVD. Thirdly, the wedding gown segments are virtually repeats of one another--showing the typical silhouettes of wedding gowns and recommendations of figure types for each. 
 I agree with a couple of posts that say this is a very basic book, and that most of the information could be found for free on the internet.  I would go as far as to say that some information would be better if read on the internet.    The examples about pivots (the key part of the book), one chart after another were not easy to follow.  The section on TA was woefully lacking.  The author has a section on Gann theory, and more or less advises to go buy the book that Gann wrote.  As it turns out, there is some pretty rich information about Gann on the web.  My biggest pet peeve about this book were the continual subliminal references (advertisements) to the author's subscription based website.  Besides that, I did not like the blatent plugging of the people who praised his book on the back cover.  It's okay for an author to put their website on the back of the book.  If the information stands on it's own then I can go to the website to learn more.  What's not cool is to give vauge trading strategies, then give some glowing account of how your subscription newsletter called the shots.  I did give the book two stars, which means I wasn't totally dissapointed.  He does stress a couple of good points regarding pivots, but it's all pretty basic beginner stuff 
 This is a religious book, Long on opinion Short on science 
 I just didn't like this book. I loved so many of Irving's earlier books, but I never believed this story nor cared for any of the characters. If you want to read a great book set in India, try Mistry's A Fine Balance. Infinitely better 
 I got this book mainly because the second edition was published in 2004 so I thought it would have the most up-to-date information on cover letter writing.  Out of this whole book, only essentially the first 15 pages address how to write a cover letter--and this they do poorly.  The main advice they give repeatedly is to include in your cover letter those skills and experience that match what your potential employer is looking for.  Good advice, but they don't really tell you how to do this without making your cover letter merely a smaller version of your resume.  I was really dissappointed with this book and would recommend other sources, even if they are perhaps a bit older 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc.  However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue 
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 ...I read a chapter of the book at a bookstore and my opinion is it is good if you want more practice questions to add to other resources you are already using. (I know it is kind of funny the way review question and answers are numbered 
 First of all  A. Packs are idiots disguised for money. B. this is no goody, the two movies are bad.  The cat says "Son of b*****" in this movie. something everyone should know is this is bad 
 With the awesomeness of the Project Polaroid album fresh in my mind I started uploading my old Kool Keith albums to the iPod today. Well, this disk keeps getting spit back out my computer... If this isn't a hint I don't know what is.  Definitely pick up the Polaroid disk and even if you are trying to complete a Kool Keith collection, consider leaving Undertakerz out 
 I'll admit the band is heavy and they have a decent groove but thats it!! What kind of name is Skweetis?? Stoner Witch?? Sweet Willyrollbar?? LOL!!! I mean you people can't take this crap seriously right?? But I guess meaningless songs turn you on....like Ziggy Stardust....another stupid name from the king of all buttlovers...Are the Melvins buttlovers too?? Must be if you idiots like it 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 Thankfully, I was able to browse at this in my public library before buying it. The title doesn't reflect on the actual book. While the illustrations were clear and quiet a few were lovely the book failed to explain how the artists used anatomy and how they determined how to compose their figures. for an anatomy book, this falls horrible short. There about a handful (literally one handfull) of pages with live models. The images are of various sizes and almost on top of each other. More annoyingly for what few live model poses we are given the best are put inbetween two pages. You'll have an annoyign crease righti n the middle of the picture. It's not that hard to fill in the gaps, but certain details are lost from this type of placement.  Also when going into skeletal structures he might have used a real model skeleton instead of sketches. You don't get an adequate understanding of dimension with a pencil depiction alone. Also, most of the book is dedicated to the common characters of comics (e.g. the barabarian, the female robot, Muu the fatman, Brutus the hulk). All these characters really show are sketches at different angles with bullets with brief  common sense info.   Plus the anatomy of most of the characters arenot really explored. It would have been nicer had they compared the exagerated features with realistic features.  Overall , despite some talented artists' contributions, this book fails in teaching anything abotu anatomy 
 This is a sad book. History was very unkkind to this woman. Just when she thought she completed here masterpiece, a book that was supposed to ensure her tenure and fame and all the things that a sociologist may want, everything blew up in her face.   Her theory in the original version went like this; Why oh why are there huge concentration of functions in Tokyo, London, New York, when so much IT allows easier communication and remote office and all that? Why do these cities grow, when all the production and other functions gets shipped off to backwater countries?  Well, she said, IT allowed the separation of production and management/development. That's why managers remain in cities with their high pay, while actual sweat work goes to third world child labor under measly wages.  But why did the cities grow bigger? Well, because cities are the new production centers. Management and stuff requires a lot of legal services and accountants and other services etc that are much easily available in the cities. That's why all those management stuff accumulated in the city.  But aren't those activites just leeches to the actual job? They don't create any new value, do they? Aha, she says. But they do! Look at all those financial innovations, like hedge funds and derivatives and stuff! Look how much money they are making! They are not leeches, they are creating new values. You gotta throw away your old ideas about the economy! Only cities can produce that sort of new financial products, and that's why London, NY, Tokyo are growing!  There was another brownie point. Her theory went very well with shallow anti-globalism arguments. Managers stay in NY/London with high pays, while at the factories half way around the globe, workers suffer forever under low wage.  But exactly when the first edition came out, everything changed.   First was the collapse of the Japanese economy, that took down Tokyo with it. Her theory had nothing to prepare or explain this. What happened to the new production? What happened to all those financial innovation? Why didn't that work in Tokyo? In the book, Sassen tries to answer this using various ad-hoc excuses, but the more she does it, the less convincing the original proposition becomes. So it wasn't THAT important, after all? All those theories of yours were only subordinate to those other stuff that you never mentioned before?  And yes, what about those innovations? Collapse of LTCM and huge hedge funds etc. since the first edition made finance less glamorous. Arbitrage does increase some efficiency of the market, which does create some value. But they were not the major new "product" to sustain the world.  Her theory about the separation of production and management wasn't so hot afterall. Look at Asia, look at China! Concentration of production functions REQUIRED many management and design / development functions to go along with them. Also, the factories did make the workers richer, and as a result, much of Asia and China really became better off. There are dicrepancies, and differences in earnings, but its nothing like what Sassen had described.  It's amazing that NOTHING of here original theory remained. In this second version, she tries to pick up the pieces, but they are too completely destroyed to be picked up, and the effort is almost painful to read. I wonder why she even bothered with the second edition. It's not a book worth salvaging in 2001, and it's hardly worth reading, except as a sad but amusing look back at the strange ideas of the past 
 Please do not waste your time reading this book. It is soon obvious that the authors have done very little research into their topic. Some of the obvious errors are: Ian Fleming did not write the screenplay for "A View to a Kill" as the authors claim, the wristwatch garrote appeared in the film "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" which the authors fail to mention, and the authors must have gone into the kitchen for a snack while watching "Goldeneye" since they seemed to have missed a Russian fighter crashing into the Russian facility. Since the authors base some of their reasoning on some of these errors, their final conclusions fall a bit flat.   My other complaint is how often the authors plug another one of their books. Several times in "The Science of James Bond," when the authors have introduced a field of science, they drop the topic, explaining that the reader will have to find more information on the particular field by referencing another title by the authors. To me, this reeks of laziness and commercialism 
 I was so excited about this book.  I absolutely adored Alice in Bed, I figured, 'Great, the saga continues'!  But, no it didn't continue, it stopped dead.  What happened to Schine's entertaining sarcasm and wit?  It's replaced with a sloppy writing style and silly pages containing lists of birds!  I could barely read this book.  I kept wondering where the Alice that I fell in love with went.  Louis was an annoying yet endearing character in the first installment, but now he seems to be bordering on some benign lunacy!  I didn't like anyone anymore!  A very big disappointment 
 Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book.  The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting.  I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through.  So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice 
 This movie contained alot of nice visual effects and the sound effects were pretty impressive. However, for some reason Gong Li who is Chinese played the role a Cuban woman who was the lead actress in the movie.  It says alot about the Hollywood studios that they can't cast qualified Hispanics for leading roles even in movies that take place in or are about Latin America. This was a major setback to the film, it lacked believability, it was not genuine to me at all 
 Your book, to me, conveys false conclusions:  if our country's forefathers/founders could overcome such biases in their media to create our country, then our current complaints of biased media are either unfounded or overblown since either 1)current media is less bias than in the past or 2)we will overcome the media bias as our forefathers did to do or create something as  positive as they did when they created our country.  1) The majority of our forefathers were directly or probably one generation away from the oppression, either political, religious, or social [class], which drove them here in the first place despite the difficult journey.  Their first-hand or recent knowledge of their oppression, and their reactions to it, trumped the old media's propaganda!  They knew too much first-hand to be hornswoggled by media, only newspapers and pamphlets then.  In essence, they KNEW what they would NOT stand for regardless of what the media stated, for they had LIVED it, barely, or parents had!  I would submit to you we would NOT have bought the administration's nor biased media's false assertions regarding Saddam had we had war on our soil in recent memory.  We would have ALL known what war was first-hand and would NOT have made this "decision" so readily or cavalierly.  2) How many of the colonists could read?  Yes, obviously, the founders could, but the average colonist had to depend on the educated founders, or that class of folks, to tell them the news and its ramifications, which were translated through the founders' own biases.  Today, folks get their "facts" from many "news" sources other than newspapers or the almost extinct pamphlet, i.e. tv, internet, books, etc. The selection of which source is often a result of their ideology, rather than in the past, when they took what was available as far as source.  I would submit the lack of recent knowledge of oppression or lack of freedoms, the lack of civic education - heck, ignorance, no knowledge of history, apathy, and trust, albeit, misplaced - contribute, in my opinion, to the increased harm the current biased media does to We, The People and OUR Country!  Let's face it, the majority of us are used to Walter Cronkite, NOT Bill O'Reilly, (of course, depending upon one's generation) and their inherent credibility or not. Which of these people is more credible, or stated another way, which of these people has been caught in lies or scandals?  So, NO, I do NOT agree with what I think are your false conclusions or dismissal of harm done by current biased media.  I believe the harm is immeasurable.  I believe it is MORE than unfortunate given it DIRECTLY lead to an invasion based on LIES.  ALL these years have passed since our country was founded, and the press, collectively, has NOT improved or evolved in a positive way with any depth, ergo, the ease the current press slipped into bias mode.  Rather, the media has digressed into lies and obfuscation.  To the degree they have committed these acts, the current media is TOTALLY complicit with the results - a war, which the majority feel we never should have embarked upon, just to mention one glaring example, AD NAUSEAM!  I am MORE than DISGUSTED over the media's active participation through their blatant bias in all the negative things which have happened to our country in the last five years!  I am just as DISGUSTED with ANY who would apologize for it, minimize it, or dismiss it.  ALL WE, THE PEOPLE, EVER WANT or DESERVE in this country is the pure FACTS, untarnished by the prism of bias! 
  As has been stated in the other reviews, no real substance to this book. I just wanted to add that this is the worst proof-read ever done. My six year old could have done a better job proof-reading. There are even entire passages that appear to be in French. WTF? You would think that as the person typing this out you could go back over your own text. Obviosly didn't happen.  See? It's not even that difficult. I just corrected two errors in my review. Before it was even posted. What a novel concept... 
 I have read several books by Nelson DeMille and have enjoyed them.  Night Fall was a good story, but had an absolutely terrible ending.  The ending ruined the book for me.  I love the character John Corey 
 WARNING! Do not waste your money or your time.  Sandra Bullock is not in this movie enough to warrent the packaging headling her as the star. [...]  The sound quality is really bad, as well as the lighting and if they used a script that too.  Run from this movie 
 Packaged with four left legs (requires two left, two right)   One briquette grate is smaller than the other and falls to bottom as a result.   Had to drill / elongate hole to install grate support bracket   Paint on handles started to run when I handled them with wet hands. I tried to rinse off the remaining paint or ink under running water so that it will not continue to bleed off. What paint do you know of that rinses off under plain water?   Right cast iron grate cracked when it came in contact with heat.    The design and construction of this product shows clear disregard for the consumer and is absolutely unacceptable at any price. I have to question at this point weather or not the paint used on the grill and grates is toxic or lead based. I've come across my share of junk but this is really bad!    
 As my friend (who was a childhood friend of Eddie Kendricks) and I listen to this, we just shook our heads.  Unfortuately, this remixing takes the life out of these brilliant recordings.  We broke out one of the original "Temptations" albums for comparison.  There is no comparison.  A lot is lost in this remix 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 King of run-on sentences, that is.  The problem with Benford's books isn't the story.  This book, along with the first in the series, In the Ocean of Night, presents an absolutely fabulous story.  Benford has come up with a really excellent idea for a series of books.  The problem is Benford's writing.  For some reason, Benford forgets that "science fiction" consists of two words.  He places much emphasis on the first word, but doesn't realize that it's fiction.  Mr. Benford, this is not a science textbook!!!!!!!  Getting the science right in a fictional book is all well and good, but if one can use the book to teach a physics class, then the writer's priorities are a wee bit skewed.  If you wish to write a textbook, then write a textbook, and leave the fiction to fiction authors.  In addition to putting waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis on the science, the structure of his writing leaves much to be desired.  As previously mentioned, he seems to have an ongoing love affair with the run-on sentence.  There are literally whole paragraphs in the book which are nothing but one huge sentence.  And you can forget trying to follow a conversation via the use of properly placed quotation marks.  A quotation mark is to Benford what holy water and crosses are to vampires.  I give this book 2 stars simply because the writing is so horribly bad.  The idea behind the story rates a stellar 5 stars, but I had to subtract at least 3 for Benford's pitiful excuse for prose.  I actually feel that giving it 2 stars is a generous showing on my part, as I was sorely tempted to give it 1.  A word of advice to the prospective reader of this series:  Read it after having a couple of glasses of wine.  It helps.  (Seriously. 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 This is a soap opera that either wants to be literature, or was marketed as literature. It's a romance novel. Many people over a period of many years fall in love, get married, have affairs, grow up, grow old, and have children of their own. Though the characters are scientists, their crushes and affairs are no different from any others' (the book jacket says it's about "inner lives of smart people"). Regrets are a large part of their lives, though only one or two characters are well-drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy, and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to. Large editing problems render this clearly a first novel, though I give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it 
 Flavor is just passable. The cracker is too thick,& have not found a topping that will soften it.. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 While there are many positive aspects to this diet (namely, increased fruit and vegetable consumption), I did NOT find it effective for weight loss. My sister and I both followed the menu plan for phase one...my sister stayed the same weight and I actually gained 1 pound! I believe that the foods were not filling/fibrous enough for the calories, since you use fruit juices and concentrates and some other relatively empty foods. I will say that I felt healthy otherwise and had less headaches than usual. This may be a good general way of eating for some, but it was ineffective for weight loss as it promises.  I would recommend "Eat to Live" by Dr. Joel Fuhrman instead of this book. Dr. Fuhrman uses medical evidence to back up his beliefs, and I truly believe that his medical background makes it trustworthy and revolutionary 
 This book, which won the 1926 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, is a collection of stories about the Chinese told as if they were folk tales (however, I have later discovered  that they may not be true folktales but Chrisman's original stories). I  didn't really care for them and I wouldn't recommend them strongly for  children today. But, I'm probably in the minority with that viewpoint 
 Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one 
 I am writing this primarily to warn people from wasting their time with this book.  I would write an exhaustive explanation of why this book is so bad, but I don't want to waste any more of my own time with this book.  For  an excellent book, read either THE FOUNTAINHEAD by Ayn Rand or ATLAS  SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand.  Actually, read *both* of them 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 It's a big stretch to call this music.  A more descriptive title would be Ambient Sounds.  It's more like variable white noise, or a low, almost inaudible base monotone with hissing.   It may work if you want background sounds all night, but I prefer to listen, relax, and then turn it off when I'm sleepy.     I bought Peaceful Music for Sleep for our daughter's naps.  It's also by Jeffrey Thompson, and it is music-like a gentle flute and piano duet.  It certainly seems to help our daughter sleep, and puts me in a restful and peaceful mood too.     I expected Ambient Music to be similar, so I was very disappointed.  I can't listen to this CD long enough to find out if it works.  I suggest you listen to the sample if you can. (I didn't.)   On my computer it sounds like very quiet, almost inaudible hissing.  That's what this CD is like.  Obviously it works for some, but if you want relaxing music, try Peaceful Music for Sleep instead.   
 Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch.  So what?  This book is about bad science at its worst 
 Noonan has lost all of her credibility. I had hoped to read a thoughtful and well-written piece of work. Unfortunately, this book reeks of hate and partisan politics run a muck. No one admires cheap shots--not even a conservative 
 In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate 
 I tried and tried to convince myself that this sounded good, or even acceptable.  Alas, the sound was so muddy, no matter what I did.  I set the EQ on treble boost, and I pressed the "3D" button on the unit.  Still as muddy and muffled as could be.  Besides that, there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a CD player searching for the next track.  Amazingly, I never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones.   I am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set 
 This book is meant for a pop audience.  Its completely out of date and does not take into account the vast research at major computer-human interaction conferences such as ACM SIG-CH 
 This book is not what it appears. It is a defense of Woodwards assesment of Nixon and watergate and attempts to imply that this is what brought down Clinton. THAT IS NOT THE CASE as Clinton was not only a lier but clearly immoral. There is no way Mr. Woodward can cover his Political leaning with this type of story. When you read this book it clearly is 50% Clinton and defending his and Hilary's actions under Whitewater and the Clintons' misconduct in the Whitehouse as President. In all fairness to Mr. Woodward this book is far below his standard of fair and honest reporting. Let admit it, this is no more than a defense of his reporting on Clinton and Nixon 
 Made very cheaply. The slider won't even hold the batteries in with a good enough contact to charge the batteries once. I tried every available slot and they all give a poor contact.  Avoid this charger at all costs 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Sadly, James Spader's voice couldn't save "Strange Highways."  The story is a good idea that just went wrong and the writing isn't that good either.  The similes are clich-ish, and bits of vocabulary are dropped into the story which just don't fit.  The protagonist is so slow on the up-take, when faced with repeated evidence of supernatural experiences, that he should've been killed just to end his rampant stupidity. 
 Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album 
  I would not recommend this book. I found this book a real disappointment.  I do not wish to spend an hour figuring out what the calories in every meal are.  There is a lot of information, but it is spread at random all over the book and the index is almost completely useless.  It also recommended calorie intake levels that I believe would be appropriate for a roofer or a dockworker, but for most people with sedentary jobs, she was very far off.  
 Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get 
 When I read the reviews I thought the book would talk about foreplay. I can't tell the story, but I bought it for my husband. After a week he told me he had read some,-but I wasn't getting any good response, so I asked him for the book-. I read it in less than an hour, and I was so disappointed my heart sank... the book mostly encourages on being a closed union to take care of everyday chores equally. We have that already, we're like perfect roomates, get along great, everyday chores get happily distributed by themselves between the both or us. But he keeps thinking that if he's a good husband, meaning all that it's in this book, then he only needs to be "in the mood" may be once a month, and just go silently and finish within a minute. I'm sorry this book didn't help my pathetic life.  Ray Romano Inawomansbody 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
  I read on page 56--      "But while there is life, not everything is lost. The darkest hour is just before the dawn. To repent and feel remorse for a life wasted is to go into mourning for a past that has not been lived. Temporary depression is the condition of spiritual growth - it's hibernation of a life that retires into itself and prepares to return renewed. From the extreme limits of pain, as in childbirth,, there bursts forth indescribable happiness, a flood of love."  There's something seriously wrong here 
 The documentary on Larry Hoover was pretty good and detail. I thought it would have more interviews with Hoover, but the ones that was illustrated was good. The information of the Gangster Disciple Organization being 4th on Fortune 500, blew my mind. I'm hurt that our brothers' and sister are being caught up in the game with gangs and drugs. This is a good DVD on the history of Chicago's most empowered gang in our history. Sincere prayers to Larry Hoover's entire family 
 Interesting footage, flag waving patriotism, pick the future star movie of Marine landing on Japanese held island, but little suspense. 
 I bought the book thinking it would be a practical introduction on how to apply CMMI to your company hence I was very disappointed to find out the authors have limited themselves only to summarize the CMMI models. Few real explication is given about concepts within the CMMI models, neither any real life experience is shared that could help you implement CMMI 
 All Volumes Reviewed: Is this the work of Michel Foucault, the author of "Order of Things," "Discipline and Punish," and "Archeology of Knowledge?" Surely, this must be a hoax. Foucault is notoriously provocative, keenly insightful, and always virulent. So what happened here? Hardly much of a history, anything but provocative, entirely pedestrian, already outdated, and woefully incomplete. Accessibility is not a problem, unlike "Archeology of Knowledge," but truly lacking in information, perspective, and relevance. Compare, for example, this trite and superficial reading with Compton's expansive and exhaustive "Homosexuality and Civilization." After all, Foucault was gay and into sado-masochism. The two are incomparable. A complete waste of time (since I was sure Foucault had something quixotic to write over three volumes), but hope never materialized into reality. PASS 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 I recently purchased a copy of this edition, having loaned a niece with children my copy from a couple of years ago (which I may not get back...but that's okay) last Christmas.  It's a let-down from the other version; the interview with Arthur Rankin (informative) is missing, the scene where Yukon finds his dream as Rudolph and Santa are leaving Christmastown is cut out (one of the key scenes deleted from the TV airings to make room for ads) again, yet the question on the trivia game on it is there.  The Destiny's Child video is okay for the younger audiences but..me, I have an idea; why not a little info and maybe footage of who first popularized the song in the first place: Gene Autry?  I just ordered another copy of the older edition from 2000. 
 This book is ok if you are after the theory of Home networking protocols and hardware. But there is too little practical information. eg. it doesnt tell you how to configure wireless connection in windows xp, nor does it tell you how DSL networking works in practice 
 Last Minute Knitted Gifts is one of my favorite knitting books, so I bought this book hoping to find lots of inspiration for cute sewing projects.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with it.  Many of the patterns (scarves, blankets, dishtowels, a sarong) involve not much more than buying a large piece of fabric and hemming it. Some projects are not sewing projects per se, but rather involve felting (felted rocks?  Seriously?), or simply using fusible interfacing to attach fabric to things.  While the results of all of these types of projects aren't unattractive, I'd rather use my limited crafting time to create, rather than embellish, and I certainly don't need a book to tell me that if you hem a piece of fabric, you can call it a blanket.  As for the actual sewing projects--well, some are cute, but if you can't find versions of them for free on Craftster or the crafty blogs, you're not looking very hard.  There are some cute projects here--a darling felt bunny, a patchwork pillow, a hooded towel that would make a great baby gift--but overall, I think anyone who is interested in more than basic beginner-level fabric projects would be better served by Amy Butler's In Stitches or Denyse Schmit Quilts. At the very least, I'd look at this book in a store before you spend the money 
 I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote of the guilt trip that this book gives to working mothers.  I am an Australian who is residing in the USA, and I am shocked and appalled at the American attitude towards working mothers.  In Australia it is the norm for women to pursue careers and work in fulltime jobs, whether they are single, married, de facto, mothers, young, old, whatever.  Childcare is a policy issue for government, is often subsidised, and considered imperative for the growth of the economy and the wellbeing of the community.  What assistance does the American government give to working mothers?!  How does the American media portray mothers of Generation X?!  The attitude here is so far behind it is laughable.  For American authors to claim authority over subjects such as Generation X and its place on the world stage, they will need to update their ideas and look to other societies as well as their own.  
 Recently I read about the revival of "A Chorus Line" on Broadway. I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek.  Well, somewhat disappointed here.  I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film.  It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable.  Even songs which I had heard before, like "What I Did For Love", were reduced to barely a mention in the film.  The film seemed to lack any real point.  A bit of a yawner. 
 I tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when I couldn't get a consistent reading.  The temperatures were so varied it was completely useless!!  Very disappointed!! I returned it without even the box 
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 I agree with everyone, the soundtrack has got nothing to do with the movie.  but if you were like me, looking for that tune from the bar, its called Everybody Look the Same by Groove Armada, and you can get it off the soundtrack for the Movie the Next Best Thing, with Madonna and Rupert Everett.  Or you can do like I did, and download it....you know where from 
 In "The Great Divergence", Kenneth Pomeranz presents an exhaustive investigation of the minutest differences and similarities in development of China and Western Europe. His claim, and stated objective, is to show that Europe's emergence as a preeminent power was the result of privileged access to overseas colonies, exploitation of non-Europeans, and a fortunate `geographic accident' of the location of coal in England. However, considering China's significant, and much earlier, developments in science, technology, and shipping, not to mention their huge deposits of coal, and its use some 600 years before the Europeans to make iron, it's difficult to understand Pomeranz's rationalization of those claims and ultimately the whole point of his book.  His specialty and interests clearly lie in China. In this book he attempts to shed a somewhat biased benevolent light on China by explaining the violent circumstances that led to the industrial revolution in Europe, and why it didn't happen in China. He presents a comparative analysis in such close, tortuous, detail that he becomes myopic in drawing his conclusions. His joy and skill clearly lie in analysis, rather than synthesis, and in the process, and among the ensuing debris, he loses a view of the whole as processes of nation building rather than competing sets of historical data. The outcome notwithstanding, he consistently paints each step in the process of growth in Europe and its colonies as a violent and ugly stepsister to a more sophisticated, benign version taking place in China. All of which may be true, but he discounts the effects of institutions, capital markets, capital accumulation, and regulatory competition in Europe as having marginal effect on the difference in outcome between the two areas because in his opinion what was happening in Europe was so similar to what was going on in China. He states that "European science, technology, and philosophical inclinations alone do not seem an adequate explanation, and alleged differences in economic institutions seem largely irrelevant".   Regulatory competition in Europe, for Pomeranz, equates to military competition. Although it could be argued from a more objective perspective that military research and development regularly spins off technological advances applicable in commercial areas, Pomeranz claims that in Europe `the net effect of warfare on technological innovation is likely to have been negative'. Clearly not true, but his argument about it possibly killing off other inventors was kind of funny. The development of institutions and property rights arising from this competition for him equals only the purchases of position, interference of guild control, and the granting monopoly privileges. He claims that all served to keep prices high, limit the extent of markets, and restrict output. The most positive function of `military' competition seen by Pomeranz is in the overseas projection of power. This lies in contrast to his claim that China was engaged in competitive trade with low margins, unprivileged by the state, that couldn't generate enough profits to finance a European style military capitalism. Here he ignores the Chinese obsession with intensive land use to feed its armies. The vast differences between the European states and the diversity of politics, social constructs, and institutions therein will show that had any single one of them been dominant the story of Europe, and the world, would have been very much different. Had the Chinese the benefit of this fracture, the voyages of Zheng He would have been continued, but when he died, the Confucians were regaining power and There was no political or spiritual will to continue. They felt that other nations had nothing to offer the already prosperous Chinese and they had no need to conquer their souls. Their voyages were ended, their fleets were dismantled and they turned inward. It became a crime to set sail from China in a multi-masted ship. This was their choice. One nation, one choice. Had there been competition among states in China, someone, somewhere would have chosen to continue.  As far as ethical systems and ideology are concerned, Pomeranz doesn't consider the consequences of differing motivation but only writes that philosophical inclinations do not seem an adequate explanation of divergent paths. Lost in analysis of the details of the similarities, here he misses the significance of the differences. Arguing that they were too small to create the large disparities in outcomes, he fails to ask whether those differences were what led to different choices. The differences in the ethical systems of Christian Western Europe and Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist China are enormous. The differences in the choices made within the context of those systems, especially within the protestant reformation and the creation of the Church of England, are significant. Pomeranz claims that ideology, or `philosophical inclinations', can't explain the different outcomes in the fortunes of China and Europe, but it was ideology and philosophy that led to the divergence in their development paths. Western Europe's history of fighting Muslims to keep them at bay and out of Europe established their crusading zeal to protect themselves by trying to convert everyone they could find. They embodied this fear and hegemonic drive and made Christian solipsism an imperative part of their culture. Vasco Da Gama said that the objectives of his voyages were "Christians and Spices". This dogmatic drive of the Europeans and their churches' implicit consent of their conquests and colonialism lent a higher power to their expansion. The Chinese chose not to continue their voyages. The Europeans were on a mission from God.  In this book, great tenaciousness in presenting historical data meets an astounding lack of insight into behavior and economics, and leaves the reader (at least me anyway) wondering why it was written in the first place. 
 Everyone I know in physics, like myself says "I don't know about the Taoism, but he doesn't have the physics quite right." Everyone I know from an Eastern Philosophy background says "I don't know about the physics, but he doesn't have the Taoism quite right."  
 This book's tongue-in-cheek title led me to expect an entertaining and informative history of one of the world's great foods. I discovered, rather, an informative but tediously boring history of the rural peasantry  of Ireland, England and France in the 18th and 19th centuries. I can only  recommend the book as a potent soporific capable of curing the most  pernicious case of insomnia. If your sleep habits provide sufficient rest,  don't bother 
 This is a very weak book.  It contains nothing but disjoint, pointless tidbits of info.  There is little logical flow. Because of this it isn't suitable for beginners. Because of its basic nature, it isn't suited for non-beginners.  If you're a beginner looking to learn to play, look elsewhere.  If your an advanced beginner and you want something to doink with, this may be ok for you.  "Blues You Can Use" is a *far* better guide for the advanced beginner who wants to be able to play something 
 Album Covers kept on the Right path for the Players but the Music just kept taken a Beaten.Billy Beck is cool on certain songs&there are some moments here&there but Compared to there Hey Day this is like a Watered Down Version of the Band.some of the music is alright but there isn't any stand-out material 
 I tried to cancel the order, but they said it has been shipped.  I was cancelling on October 13, 2006, but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17, 2006. How can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped 
 Kathy may have been doing dog training for 20+ years but she isn't staying current with what's happening in dog training. Sure she implies that she is using positive training because she's using food, but she's also telling people how to correctly leash pop their dog. Even with the food training she's using 'okay' as a release word which means that anytime that your dog hears this word in a conversation around it, it is ok for it to break from whatever behavior it was currently doing.   If you want a New Jersey dog trainer check out Pamela Dennison and her great books - The Complete Idiot's Guide to Positive Dog Training, How to Right a Dog Gone Wrong, Bringing Light to Shadow: A Dog Trainer's Diary. I would also highly recommend Pat Miller's Positive Perspectives: Love Your Dog, Train Your Dog, or The Power of Positive Dog Training. 
 This is one of her finer albums, but with this artist that is not saying a great deal.  She has better song selection on this album than on previous ones, but her voice is still no comparison to the other ladies of country music 
 We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money 
 Guenter Lewy seems to have one mission in life: to prove that there was only one genocide in world history, that of the Jewish people during WWII, and that no other ethnic or religious groups have ever been victims of genocide. In recent years, he has been publishing one book after another that attempt to demonstrate that various peoples (American Indians, Gypsies, Armenians) were never victims of genocide. To achieve his objective, he makes a selective use of historical documents, using only the ones that corroborate his thesis, and ignoring those that would prove him wrong. His reading of history is permeated with bias. I recommend anyone to read the negative review of this book by a world-class scholar of genocide, Robert Melson, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (vol. 16, no. 1, 2002). 
 Graves confirms that the only way to learn of the Greek myths is to read what the Greeks themselves wrote. If the desire is to understand what the Greek myths actually mean then Graves should be avoided.  Robin Hard, in his translation to Apollodorus' Library of Greek Mythology, published by OUP, writes "the interpretive notes [to Graves' Greek Myths] are of value only as a guide to the author's personal mythology." (p.xxxiii). I cannot agree more.  Graves' immediate failure is that he remains oblivious to the ouranographic nature of Greek myth: their myths were related to the heavens. Further, Graves fails to understand the relationship of Greek myth to the development of Greek philosophy; that the key to understanding Greek philosophy, science (& hence mathematics & engineering), is the mythology. If you read Graves you will understand neither Greek myth or philosophy.  In Timaeus Plato wrote that when the creator "had compounded the whole he divided it up into as many souls as there were stars, and allotted each soul to a star." (Timaeus, 42).  In Apollonius' Argonautica we read of the argonaughts who paused as "the goddess Persephone sent up to them the mourning ghost of Aktor's son, who craved to see some men of his own kind ...[and having done so, he] Then sank down again into the great abyss." Book 2, lines 920.  In Homer's Odyssey we read that "Rose-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion... outraged at her conduct... chaste Artemis rose from her golden throne, attacked him in Ortygia with her gentle darts and left him dead." Book 5, lines 121-124. When given directions for sailing, Odysseus kept his eyes "on the Pleiads...or the Great Bear [who] looks across at Orion the Hunter with a wary eye." Book 5, 272-274; and once in the Halls of Hades, which lie beyond the horizon, Odysseus' "eyes fell on the giant hunter Orion, ... armed with a club of solid bronze..." Book 11, 571-575  Aristotle explains to us what all this means: "From old - and indeed extremely ancient times there has been handed down to our later age intimations of a mythical character to the effect that the stars are gods... further details were added in the manner of myth." Metaphysics, Book Lambda, 1074b.  If you read Graves you will not encounter any understanding of the heavens, the basis of Greek myth, in which the planets and constellations were the detritus of times past, rendered immortal and writ large in the heavens. This absence is explained by Graves, when he extols his belief that even "the 13th century Excidium Troiae is, in parts mythically sounder than the Iliad." p. 13. What Graves claims is that an author who commented on the myths over 2000 years after Homer actually wrote down the myths, understood them better than the person who expounded them.  Instead of looking to the sky to understand these myths, Graves claims that the only way to properly understand them is when "archaeologists can provide a more exact tabulation of tribal movements in Greece and the dates." p.20; and that consequently "A large part of Greek myth is politico-religious history."(p.17). This is seriously misguided!  Graves as becomes evident has an agenda which he lays bare when he claims Greek & Jewish myth is a product of: "The Jews as inheritors of the 'Pelasgian', or Canaanitish, creation myth.." p. 35; that is that the people of Greece, before the arrival of Greeks were the same people as those who peopled Canaan (Palestine, which is utterly unsupported by any archaeology). What Graves attempts with this ridiculous tome, is to provide a syncretist misinterpretation of Greek myth to reconcile it with the irreconcilable Biblical beliefs and he imagines he achieves this when he weaves into this his "matrilineal v patrilineal" theory as some sort of corroboration. This explains why Graves claimed that a later, Greek Christian from Byzantium, wrote a sounder mythology than Homer: the Byzantine, being Christian, had the same disposition to reinterpret Greek myths to make them more acceptable to a Christian viewpoint, as does Graves.   Greek myths are beautiful if they can be understood. Graves omits the ouranographic dimension of Greek belief because, as he makes clear, he is actually attempting to reconcile it with Jewish (hence Christian) belief. No such reconciliation can work if the author is honest. The Greeks studied the heavens; the Jews were forbidden to do so on pain of death, eg. Deuteronomy 17.2-5 & Jeremiah 10.2. Graves' book is embarrassingly silly.  (... 
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 I own four other albums and all of them are great.  When I pop in a Hootie CD I expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands.  I buy CD's and keep those CD's on the premise that the entire CD is worth keeping.  I am not buying a CD for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole. I just bought this album the other day.  Half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste.  I am giving it a 2.5, because half the album is great.  
 I sought history, facts, etc.  However, this book is written with such female-type hysteria that getting beyond the first chapter is a chore.  I am extremely disappointed.  The author obviously picked apart her research to slant the information with little or no care for common knowledge that disputes her claims.  Trash.  A definite loss of money here 
 Manfred B. Steger fails at providing an introduction to the topic known as globalization. This book starts out looking like a basic explanation of what globlization is and why it is happening. However it quickly turns into a tirade about how "bad" globalization is and how it is a U.S. plot of some sort. I am disapointed with this book becuase I was looking for easy to read basic pro vs con explanation. Steger also discusses some advanced topics which he may not explain correctly or completely. All of his arguments or either anti-globlization or extreme anti-globlization. Steger goes as far to say what Bin Laden does is good becuase is slows the globilization process 
 this is pure dung, I can't believe that Luca Turilli was involved with this cd 
    ******What is the first thing you know about a man that does not respect himself? ------He does not respect anybody else, either!*****      Chapter by chapter,  the lesson material in this book is lacking in depth, and certainly,  it is already available in other books.   James Eades personally, however,  is one of the finest individuals active in the promotion of chess.  The exception I take is the marketing gimmick in the title.    "Chess for Dummies"  by James Eade  holds an appeal for such persons  as are very intimidated by CHESS as a game. I want to make it very clear why I am critical of this book. It is overpriced. Books like this  rely on coy language in the title, to "hook" a beginner.  However these DUMMIE chess books  are not as good as many other titles already in paperback,  man of them which are priced lower,  about $17.95 and less.  NEW copies of "Chess for Dummies" are currently selling  elsewhere for $4.24,   and the market is a good benchmark of a book's impact.      I suggest the reader search carefully in this book.  Does the author refer to HIMSELF as a "DUMMIE"?  ....or is it only YOU who is the "DUMMIE" ?        Calling yourself a DUMMIE is self-destructive behavior,  pure & simple. If one must think of himself/herself as a DUMMIE,  what's the point in starting out learning a game where one must think for himself and face constant assaults upon the EGO,   SELF-ESTEEM,   and personal CONFIDENCE?    The pattern of negative reinforcement and negative self-talk destroys most beginners after a short experiment in the game of chess anyway,  and James  Eade  reinforces this fatal affirmation.            Playing chess will either destroy the notion that you can think of yourself as a "DUMMIE"  (a postive outcome)  or the individual will even more strongly regard himself as DUMMIE because he loses games (negative outcome).  It does not matter how many books you buy.  If you think yourself a DUMMIE,  you will play like one.       And in Westminster Colorado this week,  a 14 year old girl was attacked by an adult male on her way home.  She had not learned to think of herself as a "DUMMIE" in her Karate class.  She knocked her assailant down to the ground with a single punch to the head,  and got safely away.        As a teacher of chess beginners,  I introduce every new student to my two rules:   RULE#1:  "Never,  EVER,  beat yourself up!"  RULE#2:  "LOVE yourself a lot!"    That's the first lesson in the first class;  but then,  I'm training players to win and to respect themselves in much the same way that the KARATE student is taught to respect himself and others.  Regarding one's self as a "DUMMIE" might sell chess books;  but it will never make you a chess player.       The MASS MIND  makes it "cute" or "coy" to refer to yourself as a "DUMMIE";   but James Eade is not William Shakespeare,  and this is a different kind of tomfoolery.   Of course,  what do you call someone who hands  over his money to the guy calling him a "DUMMIE"?  It's like:  AUTHOR:        "Hey, bud,  you're a DUMMIE!!!" BOOK BUYER:    "Gee, thanks man. Here's Ten Dollars."       Of course,  you can learn some "beginner"  chess in the book, but that's hardly the point.  What are you going to do when you want to move up to the next level?  Are you going to search for another book titled:  "WINNING CHESS,  FOR DUMMIES WHO DON'T WANNA BE DUMMIES?"          Such books will eminently qualify you to wallow in the shallows of "casual" chess,  winning an occasional game against weak players,  right up to the point where you give up the game completely. Chess is a useful tool and one of its benefits is that it teaches us how to release our innate intelligence.      Several exciting movies have been release about chess in the past ten years:         "SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER"       "KNIGHTS OF THE SOUTH BRONX"       "THE LUZHIN DEFENSE"    I cannot remember once hearing the main character (either child or adult)  referred to as a "DUMMIE".   Think about it.        Then again,  James Eade, much to his credit,  has just come out with  "The Chess Player's Bible" a beginner's book to which I gave a five-star review.  I respect the author a great deal for his newest book.  By the new standard set in his "Bible" Eade is terrific chess teacher.     
 Results makes a solid case for building blocks that a good Business 101 textbook would tell you make up a company's likelihood for success, but Results misses the mark on identifying or leveraging company personalities.     The term `company personality' is misused.  Instead of a company 'personality', the authors appear to be more accurately describing the maturity or efficacy of a company ~ which is a VERY different realm.  Said another way, the survey tool (and the book) do not describe a company's personality, they describe a company's level of dysfunction.   Results illustrates a preferred end of the efficacy spectrum labeled Healthy in which companies are said to have mature capacities for what we know are best practices for decisions, org charts, metrics, and performance infrastructure.   On the Unhealthy end are companies that have not developed similar capacities.   Results would then have us believe that all companies should aspire to become the same personality.  Herein lies the misnomer of the term `personality'.  The Healthy-Unhealthy spectrum of dysfunction offers a simplistic explanation of what makes a company 'work', but it is only two-dimensional.   A company's personality is THREE dimensional.   A company's personality is also founded on its core values, core beliefs, signal behaviors, its attitudes, and its vision.     If you are looking to leverage success through understanding your company's personality, read Companies are People, Too (Fekete, 2003) instead.  This book (and tool set) offer a well rounded approach to understanding company personalities and provides a way for all company personalities to have their place - and still be successful!   Intuitively, it makes more sense to assert that all company personalities are necessary to create a diverse and creative market.   For leaders within a company, it is imperative to identify (and identify with!) the unique and salient strengths of their company's personality.    Only armed with this information can a company distinguish itself from its competitors.     We can initiate change in business practices, but we can not inherently change a company personality - nor should we try!    The idea of changing the personality of a company would be like trying to beat gravity!   Results does offer sound, basic business lessons regarding infrastructure necessary for business success, but it does not fulfill on the promise of understanding and leveraging a company's personality to get there.   
 I was hoping for more. No pictures. Not a lot of information. It does have a handy little map, though 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 If I didn't have the first three I wouldn't buy this. Carleton CANNOT replace Ritenour. The CD may have well have been a Carleton CD featuring James, Mason, and East. Fourplay is Fourplay and will always be good as  long as Bob James is still there 
 I don't even know where to start.   If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community. And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like "sharks."  This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See "Driving the Amish" by Jim Butterfield 
 This thing is miniscule. It barely fits on my (petite) seven year old's neck. Although the size is mentioned in the description, the picture is misleading - the pendant itself is *smaller* than the image on the screen - and I consider that borderline false advertising.  I should have been a more aware buyer, so this review isn't to say the product is bad, just be aware of how small it is - my daughter couldn't even find it in the bag when I gave it to her, it was so small she thought I'd bought her an empty bag 
 Like so many others, the Fed chairman is a mediocrity who rose to prominence by serving as a flunkey to David Rockefeller through exclusive membership in the J.P. Morgan-Chase billionaire's semi-secret Trilateral Commission.  Greenspan has long deserved to be exposed not for his own evil but for the greater evil that he is covering up.  Unfortunately, Batra's book is so poorly done, that one almost suspects that he was paid by Rockefeller to write it.  The author begins by assuming what he is trying to prove thereby destroying any possibility of being taken seriously as an economist because of his unscientific bias.  In fact, the only thing that can be said in his favor is that he is honest enough not to make any pretense of objectivity.  He tells you right off that this is going to be a hatchet job and immediately gets down to looking for facts to support his allegations.  Instead of talking about Greenspan's relationship to Rockefeller, Batra diverts attention to any problem that exists in the economy and blames it on Greenspan.  This is like a medical book discussing cancer in terms of its symptoms rather than its causes 
 The thesis is provocative, but that's it. The work is--with regards to scholarship--deeply impoverished. Venerable writings on Hip Hop remain few--consult  Robin Kelly's or Tricia Rose's forays on the subject for  more engaged, scholarly readings 
 If you are watching a Surrender Cinema film for the plot and production values you have problems I am not going to go into but if you want goofy fun sexuality this company an this movie can be a real winner. I will warn you the unrated version they are selling is the edited version. I have seen 3 cuts of this movie NC-17 very hot, R for cable etc. and the one being sold here, if they just edited out an additional 36 seconds it would be rated PG-1 
 This book has a lot of useful info, probably more than 1st Aid, and the outline format organization is great to follow. So I think its best to either go with this book or 1st Aid. I recommend 1st Aid. It worked for me 
 It's obvious that my review differs from the majority, but I emphatically stand by my opinion: this movie was really, really, really lousy.   Keifer Sutherland (whom I generally like a lot...he is why I watched this turkey in the first place) portrays a stone alcoholic, chain-smoking, gravel-voiced, burned out bum of a cop who guzzles gallons of booze and staggers from scene to scene like one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. This is his worst performance (that I have ever witnessed) and to make matters even more grim, the entire plot is a confusing, poorly-directed mess. I think that the majority of Keifer's boozing is due to his embarrassment over appearing in this truly wretched movie.  If you insist on viewing this bomb, you will hear the word "Jabberwocky" at least 10,000 times (and come to hate it with a white-hot intensity)....you will see Keifer Sutherland's character drink countless gallons of whiskey (often straight from the quart bottle at his desk in the police station) and smoke at least 9,500 cigarettes (this movie could be used as aversion therapy by A.A. or the American Lung Association)....you will see ghosts, apparitions, and silly psychic flashbacks that are about as convincing and relevant as those in "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". At one point, a character wants to convey the name of the villain to Kiefer in a "psychic vision", so rather than just say the name (which would be way too easy), he lures the villain to appear in a mirror ("through the looking glass")....silly.  The basic premise of this movie resembles the TV series "Medium", in which a psychic can sense details about a crime by touching objects associated with the crime....but the TV show is vastly superior in every respect: acting, plot, direction, and characterization. Also, the only psychic visions that a drunk of this magnitude is likely to see involve elephants....pink ones. This movie would not qualify as a tolerable made-for-TV drama...and that is very, very sad.  There are numerous allusions to "Alice in Wonderland" (the original name of this bomb was "After Alice"): Kiefer starts having his "psychic visions" after falling through a hole, a character is named "Hatter", etc. etc. I assure you that none of this cuteness will add to your viewing pleasure in any way.   So, you can listen to the other reviewers and waste your time and money, or listen to the warning I am offering loud and clear: there is a reason that this movie was never released in theaters...and God knows, it shouldn't be released in your home either. Avoid it....you really don't need to hear the word "Jabberwocky" 10,000 times....do you ??? 
 I never received the item even though it showed available.  I don't think that should be able to list items they don't really have available 
 This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
 If rational you be, avoid this book. If you are long suffering or long for suffering in your fearful hope of the future, then this book will help you on the road to believing that repeating historical socialistic subservience to the world is the essence of hope! This guy has been in and worked in an institution his whole life... and you know why people are in institutions, don't you? It's comfortable to harbor you imaginings and believe they are real because nobody disagrees with your conclusions derived from your sylogistic reverie.    The description tells the truth ... "Barber argues for an America that promotes cooperation, multilateralism, international law, and pooled sovereignty." POOLED SOVEREIGNTY!!! MULTILATERALISM!!! The code words 'promote cooperation' means, we will be a doormat for you... He thinks the United Nations is a great example of effective multilateralism and cooperation... so does Khadaffi and Mugabe and Kim Jung Il and Arafat and young Asad and Al-Turabi (Sudan). Those are some fine folk to select from for your next 'sovereign leader'!     This is the same tripe that has floundered center stage since Philby's Band of Brothers went to rot in Moscow. It's that same pig with more lipstick, persistently begging the citizens of the world for a kiss and a hug.     Save us all from another Fulbright academic tri-lateralist! I'm an American, and I am repulsed by the concept of being a "citizen of the world". 
 The lowest rating is one star, but I would give it a zero star. This book is 125 pages with one side blank to make it look bigger - if both sides of a page were written on, there'd be 63 pages - so you see what we're dealing with here.  The "key techniques" are comprised of bending your forward arm at 90 degrees on the backswing and placing the ball in the same position ("at the level of the inside forward foot") with every club. Eleven pages are devoted to vitamins & minerals. Folks, we're dealing here with little substance and much fluff. The author may be a great golfer but he is unable to convey to his audience how he does it in sufficient detail. Spend your money on a book by Jack Nicklaus called "Golf My Way" - a top golf book. Jack provides rationale and detail galore - I'd rate his book at 10 stars.            
 Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories.  I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing.  It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of "lecturing" about various and sundry things.  Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books. 
 This game is pretty fun but it takes forever to put it together before you can play it. My 5 year old wants to play the game immediately. Not wait 10 minutes for mommy to get it ready.They now have an electronic Ker plunk game. We will be purchasing that one soon 
 There are a few funny scenes in this film ("Bobby-Bobby-Bobby-Bobby..."); but they are too few and far between to overcome the chief flaw with the movie: There is not a single likeable character in it. From the scene with the very annoying little girl, fast-forwarding to her adult self on her morning power-walk to the newspaper stand where she buys a half-dozen papers to read before work, the Holly Hunter character is really, really grating. Albert Brooks' character is self-centered and whiny. How can you root for the Hurt character, who epitomizes the dimwitted TV talking head? You just can't find a protagonist to care about. And that's why it will definitely be on my list of single-viewing movies -- no reason at all to watch it again in the future 
 Words cannot describe how disgusted I am by this book. It takes everything we know to be fact and spits and tramples all over it.   This book is the exact equivalent of the same kind of garbage that was spewed by 19th century racist "scholars" like Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Oswald Mosley, and John Burgess. Just as they argued for white supremacy, so too does George James argue for the opposite. Nothing ever changes it seems; millions of people have to suffer and die because of racist ideologies, and yet people never truly learn the dangers of such a sickening worldview.  First of all, I'm not against people re-analyzing history. All historians will often look back at their work, or the work of someone else which may have become antiquated over the years. New ancient works may be discovered which challenge the viewpoints which we may have held as fact for decades. This is good. It allows us to get a more accurate view of the ancient world so as to learn from it. This is different from revisionist history, where the thesis is largely debated among historians. Unfortunately, and it's sad to say, this book doesn't even qualify under revisionist history; it's full of malignant lies. For those who haven't read it, here's a summary:  James argues that Egyptian civilization was black. Fair enough; if that's his argument, he must have proof, right? Well, not quite. DNA testing which has recently been done on mummified corpses (by scientists from ALL races, mind you) shows that they contained traces of Nordic, Semitic, and Persian, among many others. This was seen for both the Pharaohs and the lower class corpses. By my calculation, this means two things; either A) There is a worldwide conspiracy among all scientists involved to hide their true findings and simply make stuff up in order to fill their own agenda, or, more likely, B) James hasn't a clue what he's talking about. According to James, everyone in Egypt was black...except for the hundreds of people whose DNA indicates they were not. But hey, I guess it's possible for two entirely black people to have a Semitic/Persian/Nordic child.   It gets worse. Did you know that the Greeks were simply crooks who stole all of their ideas from the Egyptians? That's right, the Greeks didn't invent anything, it was all stolen! James has proof too: Aristotle travelled to Egypt, where he visited the Library of Alexandria and stole all of the knowledge from the Egyptians. Ouch, that's pretty rough isn't it? That's enough proof to put the nail in the coffin of Greek learning. There's just one problem; it's not true. Aristotle died in 322 BC. The Library of Alexandria was built by Ptolemy II Philadelphos, who ruled from 281 BC to 246 BC. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be pretty difficult for Aristotle to steal ideas from a Library which was built over 40 years after his death. But hey, in Mr. James' book the dead not only rise again, but also steal ideas and formulate complex thought patterns in only a short matter of time.   "The term Greek philosophy, to begin with, is a misnomer, for there is no such philosophy in existence." This is what he writes early in the book. I don't even know how to refute this argument, if one could call it such. James believes that Greeks stole their ideas from Egypt. Philosophy, science, all of it. To be fair, this belief could be possible. The Greeks were definitely influenced by the Egyptians; only a liar would deny that. But here's what I don't understand. How is it that after the Egyptians had their ideas stolen from them, they don't make a single mention of these philosophical ideas? The Egyptians were notorious for how well they recorded their achievements, yet not a single papyrus scroll, engraving, or work of art mentions anything about philosophy. This leads me to believe that either, A) The Greeks stole the Egyptian's ideas, and then Egypt suffered an epidemic of amnesia whereby everyone forgot that they ever had these ideas, or B) James is full of it. Imagine, if you will, that you and a friend are writing an essay on the same topic. Your friend comes over and, while you're unaware, steals your paper and hands it in before you. Now, instead of reporting him for what he's done, you completely forget that you ever wrote a paper, and cheerfully go about your life as if nothing happened. Sounds ridiculous, right? Yet this is the exact type of logic James uses in his book, where it is just as laughable.  I just don't understand what the point of this book is. That blacks are better than whites? Even if that were true, what does the author propose? That we discard all of Greek and Roman history because it's stolen? That schools should only teach history about black people? James never actually discusses why he wrote this book.  However, what sickens me most about this book is that it completely ignores the fact that Africa actually extends BELOW just Egypt and Nubia, and that marvellous civilizations have existed there since long before these two. African civilization is largely unknown because the tribes in sub-Saharan Africa to a large extent relied on oral tradition. There tribes did not have a Livy, Polybius, Thucydides, or Tacitus to record their achievements with a fair degree of accuracy. It is sad to say, but what is today known as sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time garnered an atrocious press. Racist ideologues called them savages and barbarians, simply because their civilization differed from theirs, and sadly, this view has stuck in many places around the world. Indeed, the truth is that Africans have a lot to be proud of, just as Europeans and Asians do. Men like George James do nothing but cause even more hatred when it is not needed. 
 ...says little more than people are happiest when they have achieved "flow"..."flow" appears to be equivalent, fundamentally, to what athletes ostensibly experience when they are "in the zone" -- focussed, everything in gear...well, that's nice...so how does one achieve "flow"?...answer: find something you really are interested in and do it...uhhhh, but what about all that time I have to spend doing things I'm not particularly interested in?...like earning a living, cleaning the house, etc, etc...personally, I don't need someone telling me I'm happiest doing things I'm interested in -- I figured that out a long time ago...I just need for someone to figure out how to avoid doing all those things I'm NOT interested in 
 I love the title--it's worthy of one of the funniest, most intelligent people I have ever met only one time (that would be Kinky--I had the priviledge of meeting him at a book signing in NYC).  I love Kinky Friedman.  Were I a female, I would probably consider compromising my virture for a vigorous roll in the hay with him but paradoxically, I really hated this book. It's not the worst book I ever read but it's one of those books where you read for 15 pages and suddenly become aware that some significant event has occurred but you were so bored you didn't even notice.  Out of my loyalty to the Kinkster, of whom I have been a fan since the Jewboy days, I read the book to the end but once I closed the book, I felt like I had to shower to remove the overpowering odor of the mildewy plot.   Speaking of the Jewboys, I wish Kinky's sidekick Jewford would write a book. That boy's funny. 
 This book is a disappointing finish to the Gemini trilogy.  The characters were inconsistent with the first two books of the series in such a way that this book seemed not a finish at all but rather a separate story all together.  
 Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG.    While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.)    The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore.    I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 Interesting book.  Unfortunately it really plays on stereotypes.  It does have a few valuable things to say though 
 This product does not cool down the car.  It is too small.  I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe 
 This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.  The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.  As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item 
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 I'm disappointed with this DVD for several reasons.  I was expecting a calming session like the one in "Yoga for Beginners," but this one moves rather quickly, with cheesy, distracting, somewhat upbeat music.  Walden's instruction is rushed, and on my sound system the music rather overwhelms her voice.  She doesn't use "mirror image" cueing on this one, so that when she stretches out her right leg and you stretch out your right leg, you end up bending in opposite directions.  I find this confusing and hard to follow, especially when it comes to the twisting poses.  The other thing that really bugs me is all the props you need---not mentioned on the DVD cover, of course.  To do this workout as presented, we absolute beginners need a blanket (easy), two blocks (okay, sure), a real yoga strap, not just a tie (hmmm) and a bolster (these cost $45!).  Oh, and a handy empty wall right near your DVD player for lots of the poses.  The fold-out pose guide comes nowhere near to containing all the poses presented on the DVD, either.  There is good material in here, and Walden is obviously an excellent instructor, but the whole package does not work for me.  What happened to elegant simplicity 
 This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee. That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives 
 The book does have some helpful tidbits, but the overall tone that "this will work for all chidren" is overly confident. Not a bad idea to skim it if you are reading everything written on the subject, but there are better books out there 
 If you are interested in Kabbala, it is best approached within the framework of a lifestyle observant of Jewish Law.  As one reads Gershon Scholem's books the thoughtful reader will quickly realize that he does not believe what he is writing. His point of view is intellectual only and he did not in his lifetime practice.   Anyone can take some of the principles of Kabbala and use them to get some pretty cool results. The unfortunate thing is that the earlier comment that you can get the same feelings from reading a dungeons and dragons book was absolutely true. The author of the Zoar, and the real kabalistic texts assume that the only people reading them would be Torah Observant Jews.   For the Kabbala to be explored, even slightly, requires the same strict adherence to Torah that the early masters had. Anything less is folly. Yes you can have nice feelings that are real, but you can get those practicing tai chi, you can meditate deeply, but anyone can do that counting sheep.  These people who say that this books and all others by Gershon Scholem are a waste of time are correct, but don't allow that to convince you that Kabbala is not of value. He did not know that he approached it in the wrong way, but you don't have to.   If you are interested in learning Kabbala do not purchase this book. 
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 In New York City, Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled wealthy immature young woman, living as if she were a princess in a fairy tale. Her father was a popular rock-and-roll guitar player, who died in a plane crash with Molly's mother when she was a little girl. On her birthday party in a nightclub, she meets Lorraine "Ray" Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a nasty young girl with attitudes of adult , living with her careless mother and a terminal father in a fancy uptown apartment. When the accountant of Molly vanishes with her US$ 100,000,000.00 inheritance, Molly is left with nothing but debts, and she needs to work to survive without having previous experience or any skills. She is hired to be Ray's babysitter, and their close contact makes Molly reach the maturity and Ray act like as a child of her age. The film's weakest link is the script, it simply isn't enough to hold your attention all the way through and descends into cliche-ridden moments which do nothing to emphasise the talents of the two leads. 
 I was a fan of Baywatch for most of the 11 seasons it was on TV so I was glad to hear it was coming out on DVD . I bought season 2 only to be dissappointed. Not only are the seasons or episodes not in sequence but that the original music has been replaced. The opening theme song has been changed to some slow boring song that does not match up with the action of the credits. Season 2 episodes of this DVD are actually season 3 and then you get 2 episodes of the 1989 original which should be in the season 1 DVD. I won't be wasting any more of my money until this problem is corrected and the show is put back to it's orginal form 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 I had to read this book because of a class, and I could barely force myself to finish it.  This was one of the most boring books I have ever read - and I am a voracious reader.  This is not my idea of a memoir because there is nothing personal about it.  There is no sense of Ms. Didion or her family in this book, or who they are.  As a history, the book is disjointed, with disconnected chapters, an overabundance of quotes, and no sense to be made out of it all.  It is also extremely dry and full of facts that don't add up to any kind of whole.  I actually lived in California for twenty years and I loved it.  I couldn't imagine a less interesting book about such a vibrant and fascinating state.  I can only think that critics are praising this book because Ms. Didion is such a celebrated author.  I doubt that most people would find this book interesting. 
 Great! Karen Zelan writes a sensitive book about working with autistic children. Here's my rage and despair about this book. Zelan worked for years with Bruno Bettelheim. She co-authored books with him. And she witnessed his terrible abuse against mentally ill children at the Orthogenic School where she once worked. Many of the autistic children she knew lived at this school. Why did Zelan not report any of this abuse? Because of her silence and the silence of many others, young children, teens and young adults were constantly beaten and shamed in Bettelheim's "House of Horrors" for over 30 years. And children were beaten with fists and belts, smacked repeatedly in the face and told horrible things. It was all common knowledge if you worked there. So Karen Zelan cannot say she knew nothing of such things.  Read books like Richard Pollak's, "The Creation of Dr. B." or Stephen Eliot's, "Not the Thing I Was" or Jacqui Sanders' chapter on discipline in "A Greenhouse of the Mind", if you just can't believe it. Why should Zelan be allowed to benefit from writing this book about love and acceptance of autistic childen when she 1)did nothing to stop the abuse against autistic as well as mentally ill and traumatized children while she witnessed it and 2) has done nothing to make amends for her silence by now speaking out about the abuse and the legacy of silence.  How can she even live with such hypocrisy in her soul. Because of her silence and the silence of others, I was beaten and shamed for being confused and terrified. And I resent the hypocrisy of her being the sensitive autism guru when she seems to have had no problem watching disturbed children get beaten 
 It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy.  These are one-of-a-kind quilts from the covers of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine and I can't imagine anyone wanting to replicate these patterns.  
 I can't really say that I hated this book or that I really liked it. I can say that it makes an abuser look REALLY bad and make you almost hate that person. It made me feel like my husband, even though he doesn't physically abuse me, knows what he's doing when he manipulates and frightens me. I have chosen to seek god for myself but it would be a sin to leave him. My husband is also a recovering alcoholic. Is he an abuser or an alcoholic? I don't know know, maybe he's both. Or maybe his parents were so screwed up with their own lives that my poor husband never got a chance to live a spiritual life. I do know that my husband as little to no self esteem and that is something that can be worked on I am sure. Men are delicate creatures in their emotions. Woman are much stronger, contrary to popular belief. A man will give an emotional answer to a practical question a lot. I would like a christian point of view when it comes to angry men and why they do the things they do and how to manage your family around it. I mean do I just let my husband yell at us ALL the time? The bible tells me to act one way but as a mother I feel it is my duty to stand in front of them and protect them from an emotionally abusive attack. So with that said, anyone have any suggestions? I am going to try Angry Men and the Women who love them. And see if that one is any better. I have heard it's great. 
 This is the second Vault guide that I have read, and the second disappointment that I have had with this series.  I really isn't a career guide at all, just a very short back ground on what IB is.  You can find a description of IB on the internet for free.  The only redeeming value is the "day in a life of", but even then, there are only a dozen pages or so.  In all, you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet.  I won't be buying any more vault products, as they have little information, and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information 
 This book is to simple for the real TEA exam.  If you are going to get a book to study get the ARCO Special Agent book.  The questions in the ARCO book are more complex and do a better job of preparing you for the test.  I just got done taking the test, and if I hadn't had the ARCO book I most probably  would have failed the test.  I gave it 2 stars because it does give you an idea and a start, but please don't waste your time with this book 
 The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.   It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy. 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 I have the wrong book. I needed a book on the I Mac version of Elements 4. I received the Windows version of Elements 4. To me the book is useless 
 His views are clear and well-written. But then does Andrew Sullivan have any credibility left? The advocate of the sanctity of gay marriage is known to have roam the Internet looking for unprotected sex with other HIV+ men; a journalist who accepts money from pharmaceutical companies to defend them for depriving medicine to millions of third-world AIDS sufferer; a deracinated Brit who uses MacCarthyite rhetoric to accuse left-wing writers of disloyalty to America. This is a disingenuous book written by a hypocrite 
 It was an ok book. I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books. If you are reading this for fun don't bother its not entertaining.   ~Ken 
 ... for the privilege of reviling this artless, grotesque, obscenely overpriced comic book.  Muddy graphics, asinine dialog, and a near-complete disregard of history are indiscriminately sludged together to form a juvenile desecration of the meaning and memory of Thermopylae.  Granted, this is closer to a rant than a thoughtful review, but this mindless little inkblot doesn't merit anything resembling serious discussion.  With luck, these words of warning might prevent a few unsuspecting buyers from being fooled (as I was) by some of the more glowing accounts you'll find in the near neighborhood.  The fans of "300" are in for a shock when the upcoming film version opens; they'll find that essentially the only thing in common between their "graphic novel" and the film will be the title.  The rest will be drawn from Herodotus, Paul Cartledge, and Stephen Pressman (whose "Gates of Fire" is highly recommended for those looking for something beyond the usual historic treatment of Thermopylae.)  In short, "300" should be rated SLA$: suitable only for semi-literate adolescents with an excess of disposable income in their pockets.  Literate adults will want to check out Pressman's novel instead. 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Like many autobiographies,  this book is best before Handy becomes WC Handy the great and venerated music composer and publisher.  Handy describes coming up in the hard world of the South in the years that Reconstruction was being demolished and Jim Crow segregation was being imposed.     Handy's childhood decision to become a musician flew in the face of his family's and much of the Black church (Handy's father was a minister) world's view that being a musician of any kind was hardly better than becoming a criminal.   Classically trained in both the violin and the trumpet and in composition and harmony, Handy always looked to the folk music of working class and farming African Americans and to rhythms and music he knew came from Africa as his source of inspiration. In fact, when Handy became a music professor at a Black state-run college in Alabama, he ended up resigning when the administration frowned on his teaching the students to venerate the music their people created.        Handy gives some interesting stories of life in the Black ministrel companies he worked in.  These companies were a focal point of Black entertainment between the civil war and the second world war.  Not only did 19th Century figures like Banjoist Horace Weston, and the early 20th Century dance and comedy men like Bert Williams and Bill Robinson graduate from minstrelsy to Broadway, but 20th century stars like Louis Jordan, Dizzy Gillespie, and Rufus Thomas got their start in minstrel shows.  These shows trained musicians and singers who became the founding stars of blues and Jazz. One such minstrel troupe had Classic Blues Divas Ma Rainey, Clara Smith, and Bessie Smith, all on the same bill.        Handy discusses the danger and persecution Black minstrel companies faced in the Jim-Crow South. The railroad coach his company traveled  in contained secret compartments to hide the Black entertainers from police and lynch mobs as well as places to store firearms for self-defense. Handy tells several stories that make clear that W.C. Handy might never have survived to write the Memphis and St. Louis Blues without the secret compartment or self defense with firearms.         Contrary to popular misconceptions, the blues is not an ancient form of Black musical expression. It arose in the 1890s and early 20th century. Handy grew up in Alabama, lived in Kentucky,  and Mississippi and was headquartered for years in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the big town in the area that produced Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Lee Hooker, He had heard old time Black banjo and fiddle tunes since childhood.  Yet, he did not hear the blues until the early 20th Century.   He points out that the real "inspiration" for him to incorporate the blues into the music he wrote for his dance band came in a small town in Mississippi where his band played a dance.  The country people demanded that a ragged blues trio of mandolin, guitar, and bass play a few song. As Handy and his band were tired, they welcomed the opportunity to take a break.  However with the three blusicians were finished, the crowd showered more money on them for a few songs than Handy's whole band received for a whole night's work.  Playing for Black dancers, Handy explained how he had to incorporate the blues and other rhythms and music that came from Africa into his music. Then, Handy is always insistence that the  base of his music is working and farming Black folk.  As he enters fame, Handy remains interesting, especially when he explains the way he had to battle swindling and racism when he became a music publisher. He's also pretty adamant about demanding respect for African American entertainers and for song writers and composers as well.  He's a good, friendly and often humorous writer throughout.   
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.    Overall this movie was too long, lacked character development for most of the movies characters, was disjointed, and was historically inaccurate.  For a movie that garnered so much hype I was expecting much, much more.   
 This is the first experience I have had of the Amazon "Search Inside" marketing ploy.  What a pity the publishers (I am assuming that they were the ones who selected the extracts) were so concerned about not divulging the contents of the book, that they completely failed to further my initial interest which was bordering on excitemnt.  Publishers, please make sure that whoever selects the 'Search Inside' extracts of a book you are promoting is knowledgeable enough to attract potential buyers. 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I bought my Epson Printer CX 4600 last yr. thrilled w/ it, (and the price) because I was using mostly color.  However the "thrill is gone" now.  My experience has been exactly the same as the other reviews, only I thought I had done something wrong when the brand new black ran out and after cleaning the nozzels the color was gone, and it didn't tell me which color I had to replace. If I hadn't seen these other reviews I may have taken it into my repair place and spent a bundle tyring to find out why....Too bad we can't send these "all in one" reviews to Epson.  Thanks very much for the forum. 
 This book could be good. The topic is an important one, one that faces many different people. The content however was very dissapointing. This book contains a lot of repetivness.. and not much but the same facts stated  over and over.. I was very dissapointed 
 This book, like the Amityville Horror, was sensationalized to sell and, apparently, readers were not disappointed.  Although The Myrtles is advertised as the most haunted house in the US in which at least 10 people were murdered, records indicate only one person was murdered inside the house.    Chloe, the mistreated slave mistress who wears a green turban to conceal her missing ear, is the invention of people who owned the house in the early 1970s.  In GHOSTS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI, published in 1948, the ghost in the green turban is described as that of a French governess who had lost an ear to frostbite while working in Canada, and family records confirm such a governess was employed at The Myrtles.  Although oleander is a deadly poisonous plant occasionally utilized by murderers, no such poisonings took place at The Myrtles.  This, too, was an invention of the people who changed the green-turbaned governess into Chloe, the slave.  This is not to say The Myrtles isn't haunted.  The French governess may still haunt the house along with a few other spirits.  But I would think the most active spirit would be that of Judge Woodruff who is angry about his good name being maligned by modern-day sensation seekers.  Regardless of all the hoopla about The Myrtles, it is not even the most haunted house in Louisiana, let alone in the US.  Destrehan Plantation has several real, not manufactured, spirits and is more likely the most haunted house in Louisiana. 
 in order to really understand what was going on you need to intently read every single word.  There are no solutions for the excercises which i thought were too difficult, and many times the means to find the answer could not be found in the chapter 
 Worked just fine for over a year, then started behaving very oddly. Among the various problems this TOB-30BC unit exhibited, the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off, not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle, sending alarms when switched off, not being able to switch the unit off!  This unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and I consider it to be a fire hazard.  Repeated communications to Cuisinart remain unanswered. 
 The Painted Bird by Jerzy Kosinski is one of my all time favorite books,  so, after reading it, I was anxious to check out another of his titles. I  was disappointed with the Devil Tree. I had a hard time getting through it.  I kept getting the distinct impression that it's meaning and signifigance  were going over my head. I would love to hear another reader's opinion. If  you came away from The Devil Tree with a different impression than I did,  or you would just like to converse about it, I'd be happy to hear from you 
 Silly me! I assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews, but the only ingredient you can taste in them, or any of their other "flavors" is DATES. If you really love dates, go for it. Otherwise, forget it 
 I am an avid reader of American 20th Century history.  I have devoured the books of William Manchester and David Halberstam, among others; writers who can breath life into the musty and mundane.  Sadly, this writer does not share that same talent.  This writer takes the fascinating tale of art, commerce and intruigue that became Rockerfeller Center and beats it to a slow, lingering death.  No woner you can buy it 'New or Used' for $0.72.  If you thought this guy was boring and pretentious in his anecdotal observations in Ken Burns' Baseball documentary, wait till you read this turgid piece of.. 
 The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.  I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.    If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.  If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.  (On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation about the veracity of his story. 
 The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.  Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.  A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.  I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph 
 I have Doreen Virtue's other deck of Magical Mermaids and Dolphins.  I bought this one, thinking it was the same.  I was disappointed at the sameness of the cards, and the messages.  The cards are nicely drawn and do invite imagining.  However, it is a little heavy on white horses, and does not have enough variety 
    I was looking forward to reading this book because of all the praise it recieved.  Perhaps my standards were too high coming into it, but I found this book to be tedious and completely unentertaining.  So many pages could have been removed that added nothing to the story.  I found the main characters personal life to be stereotypical and the story around the old man's biography was a chore to get through.  My recommendation would be to avoid this book, as I felt it was a waste of time. 
 If the demon is in the details, then James R. Hanson's "First Man" has slain every demon in sight.  The real tragedy is that after 648 pages, we're left with a comprehensive timeline of Neil Armstrong's life, but with little insight as to the inner workings of the man himself.  Indeed, as the commander of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, crewed by the "amiable strangers" of Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, it was ironic that the closemouthed, enigmatic Armstrong was chosen to make he first step onto another planet.  Of the three, he proves to be the least interesting.  The ambitious Aldrin schemes and works the backchannels of NASA management, trying to be the first down the ladder, while the cheerful, irreverent Collins methodically goes about his business of flying the Command Module while his crewmates make the landing.  (Collins is also an author, and his "Carrying the Fire" is a much better account of the mission than Hanson provides here.)  Despite reams of information and hundreds of interviews, Hanson chooses to let Armstrong provide much of the commentary, which proves to be a mistake.  To the end, Armstrong remains the quintessential engineer, letting the data speak for itself, and offering only the most guarded of opinions.  It's clear that his fellow astronauts have opinions of their own, and when Hanson allows them to dish, the picture of Armstrong becomes more complex.  Indeed, the book would have been far more interesting with more colleague sound-bites and less Armstrong.   Throughout Armstrong's NASA career, his managers and finally Hanson himself use him as a movie screen to project their own visions of Mom, apple pie, and the dream of beating those lousy Commies to the moon.  They hold him up as the symbol of America they want him to be, rather than the engineering near-savant he seems to become, all but cut off from any emotions of his own. Armstrong's divorce from his wife of 35 years is brushed aside in three pages.  The fact that he supposedly didn't carry anything to the moon and back for his wife and kids is passed off in a remark.  One could be forgiven after reading this book for believing that there was no room in the space progam for colorful astronauts.  However, the careers of the late extroverted, noisy Pete Conrad (Two Gemini missions, Apollo 12 landing, and Skylab), or motormouthed "Captain America" Gene Cernan (Gemini, Apollo 17 commander) would indicate otherwise.   After the moon mission, it was Aldrin and Collins who took interesting steps of their own.  Collins wrote, worked in the State Department and later managed the opening of the wonderful Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  Aldrin, crushed by his "second guy on the moon" status, battled depression and alcoholism before emerging healthy and sober as a vocal advocate of our continued presence in space.  And Armstrong?  He became a near-recluse, but not before briefly becoming a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati, roughly the equivalent of Tiger Woods taking a job as the resident pro at a public golf course in Fargo.  Rather than boost the space program which afforded him a place in history (an achievement paid for by you and me), he refused to "pimp", opting instead to delve further into himself.   Through sheer volume of details, Hanson masks the fact that this hagiography is neither an enlightening nor satisfying look at the man who forever changed interplanetary travel.  Those old enough will always remember where they were the moment Armstrong set foot on the moon (and blew his line - it was supposed to be "one small step for A man..."), but you'll never discover the human being within the moonsuit from this weighty tome. 
 I loved Moneyball but this is not interesting enough to finish. This reminds me of a book about TV's Rifleman, Chuck Connors, who died before the author did any in-depth interviewing. I am not a current baseball fan so I only knew of James from reading Moneyball. This book is mostly a rehash of James' comments, some from about THIRTY years ago. Very little of this book is based on current interviews with James by the author.  Now I am leery of trying "Baseball by the Numbers. 
 You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore 
 If "liberal" ideas have the effect on women that the author claims, then how was George W. Bush reelected in 2004?  Obviously the "liberal message" isn't working and her thesis has been disproven.  Besides, these magazines' portrayals of super-rich celebrities as "normal" people just like you and me is a prime example of how in the U.S. we are taught to worship the wealthy and to believe we, too will be wealthy one day.  Sorry Ms. Blythe, that is not a liberal idea, but a conservative one.  Also, the gossipy, malicious, tell-all that this book is merely panders to the lowest common denominator and to the baser instincts which conservatives always bemoan liberalism and the sleazier aspects of pop culture as appealing to.  I'll be the first to admit that most mainstream women's magazines influence women to believe they are overweight and that these magazines sanitize celebrities' home lives, but if you want a solution to or an intelligent analysis of these issues, this isn't it.    
 This is the most ponderous garbage I have ever read...the fact that Ms. Hakims books are geared to children makes me very upset. This is NOT a history book but a collection of her OPINIONS. Her portrayal of our American veterans in Vietnam in slanderous at best. Her facts are skewed in area's and plain wrong in others. Im a sister of a vietnam vet ( Yes, Ms. Hakim- he was a very honorable man ) and her dipiction ( they had killing weapons and killed many, many innocent people )of our soldiers is the most slanted and disrespectful I have ever read. Clearly she did not bother to speak to any veterans. No mention on what they went thru or the treatment they received when they returned. NO MENTION of the genocide/slaughter that took place in Cambodia. Please if you want your children to have the facts and to have respect for those who serve their country - keep this book out of their homes and out of their classrooms 
 Burglar on the Prowl" starts off strong, but loses steam about 2/3 of the way through. Block recycles the "suspects all in the same room" ending from one of the early novels in this series and the the book finishes on a less than satisfying note.  The "Burglar" books have always relied on loose plotting that strains credibility and oddball characters. The smartass humor is there, along with the eccentric oddly named characters, but the result seems labored and seems to recycle elements from past books (names, plot devices); there are even footnoted entries that direct you to other books in the series that explain why he has a Mondrian, etc.  I'd hoped that the long drought since the last "Burglar" book was a good sign, particularly because Block seems to have revived the Scudder series after a series of clinkers. May be the next one will be better....... 
 I have read several books on ADD and found this book to be full of the same old falacies and myths about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback as all the rest, and none of it works! It was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother!  The most helpful book that I have read is The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D. 
 There's something fundamentally wrong with the concept of a puzzle book for an application programming interface.  A book about an API should yield clarity, not puzzles 
 A cynical grab for more moolah. "Wow! These guys are real rebels with something real to say!" Sorry, this re-recording exposes them as the poseurs they apparently always were. Hey guys, how about writing some NEW music? Oh, that's right. Whatever spark you had went out decades ago.    I'm sure I would still have a good time seeing them live, but sadly, they have turned into a nostalgia act. Even the cover is a tired, boring re-hash. This GIFT should be returned 
 While the author is certainly knowledgable, the tone of the book is decidedly pedantic and offensive. He lumps all free trade skeptics together, from GreenPeace to Pat Buchanan, from Joe Stiglitz to Chairman Mao. And even throws Al-Qaeda in for good measure. People opposed to market worship "fall rather into the category of spoiled children" who are blissfully ignorant of reality. This is the starting point of the book, and this attitude continues throughout.  If you want to reinforce your market-oriented convictions, and have a tremendously belittling view of people who don't agree with you, you will love this book. If you want a measured, unbiased and well-reasoned discussion, keep looking 
 To learn what Cramer knows about recent swindles (now, after the fact) or what financial products Cramer "sells", read this book. Cramer does a great job of beating you down, then offering to be your personal savior. _____________________________________________________________ So this is what I had to say about Cramer a year ago, and now I'm a total Cramer junkie.  His radio show (...) is the best source of timely, unbiased, practical information I have found in 20 years of investment AND IT'S FREE.  Jim is right most of the time, but he also is the first to admit when he has made a mistake.    Thank you, Jim, for giving me the courage to fire my broker, improve my investment performance, and save $25,000/year in fees 
 Confuses Calvinistic moral posturing with honesty. Extremely poorly researched or evidence that didn't match cherished beliefs of the target market was omitted in order to increase sales to that niche 
 A slow-moving, pretentious novel.  The main character is arrogant and unbearable.  Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares?  And, to the author, just tell me your message.  It could have been said in one sentence.  I don't need a boring story to get your point. 
 .. must be a good, with perfect reviews on this site. Not only 5*'s every time, but everyone found the uninformative reviews useful.   Amazing eh 
 This book applies to women who are in leadership positions, which I am not, so I despise the title "Nine Secrets Every Working Woman Must Know". It's misleading. I'm currently reading this book and have only found a small paragraph that applies to "every working woman." Given the title, I thought the book would give helpful tips on getting ahead for the average working woman, but it doesn't. Needless to say, it didn't do me much good for where I am currently in my career. 
 I can't believe that people are comparing Novembers Doom to Opeth. To put them both in the same sentence is heresy in its most profane, I feel bad even putting both their names in this same sentence.  First of all, Opeth are far more talented and craft epics that shatter and defy what we know of modern music, not to mention their contribution to the re-defining of Death Metal/Melodic/Doom. Novembers Doom are average at best, there is NO stellar musicianship or amazing epic songs on this album, or any other Novembers Doom albums I have heard.  The Pale Haunt Departure has its moments, though far and few between. Every song is marred with the horrid singing and cheesy Doom talking of the singer. Seriously, his singing SUCKS! His screams are decent though, and you can hear his lyrics(which suck and repeat about the same concepts through the whole album ie..not being good enough, is there a tomorrow, blah blah blah), but he sounds like a cheap immitation of the Amon Amarth vocalist.  I will admit some of their guitar riffs are pretty good, but they repeat the same parts over and over, as if they could not conjure up decent change ups and variations, and besides a few gems mostly sounds boring. The drummer sometimes sounds like he just started drumming, he uses his snare drum way too much and doesn't seem to know how to use it. There are a few decent drum parts, but nothing spectacular. There is virtually no bass at all, heard once in a while, when you can hear it, its average. But overall, the song structure and dynamics are horrible and poorly put together. I don't see why everyone praises these guys. Maybe I just don't get the whole Doom Metal genre and its fans, but this album is weak weak weak. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the intros are the best parts of the album, but after you get past 30 seconds of each song, the song turns into garbage. People are so willing to give out 5 stars to every album. The Pale Haunt Departure is not worth 5 stars at all, more like 2.  The Pale Haunt Departure makes me realize that anyone can make an album and get signed to a label 
 My opinion may be biased because I first read about stochastic processes on Karlin's books. But I had to read this book after Karlin's books, and I am glad that I did not read this book first. 
 This is not up to the Richard Pryor comedic standard 
 I read the first chapter, and am tempted to throw the book out.  The author cannot write a clear English sentence to save his life 
 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 The subject of this book, the English women who became a buddhist nun and then spent years and years living in a cave, in solitude, meditating, is fascinating.  She deserves a better biographer, however.  The author makes a good try, but I noticed a lot of inconsistencies in the narrative (not to mention quite a few copy editing errors).  For example, she states that Palmo finds a home in buddhism because she can't believe in an actual, external "God."  Then she goes on to say, several chapters down the line, that Palmo calls upon various feminine gods for assistance.  If those aren't external "Gods" I don't know what are.  But I certainly don't cast blame on Palmo or buddhism, but rather believe that the author was confused about what Palmo was saying.  Having said all that, it is certainly a compelling story.  Palmo is obviously a very sincere, devout person, and has a great role to play in the enfranchising of buddhist nuns -- drawing attention to their need for equality and the opportunities for education that are given to their male counterparts.  In addition, Palmo's commitment to helping all sentient beings is indeed inspirational.   Truly, a fascinating book -- but I would like to see the story told by someone who does a better job at it 
 I bought this player for viewing movies while camping. Fortunately we usually sleep in our SUV so we have access to a DC power outlet. This player does come with a cord that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet. Otherwise it would be totally useless because the fully charged battery only lasts about 45 minutes.  The picture is ok but colors are not at all bright or vibrant. The sound is barely loud enough even when you're sitting two feet from the unit.  I've only watched two movies on it so far and it froze up once requiring a restart from the beggining of the movie but it does have a scene skip that allowed us to get back to where we left off pretty quickly. If it keeps working I'd say it was worth the $50 I paid for it at CVS 
 I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke.  The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.  Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.  I don't recommend it 
 Not much has changed from the original diet.  You might be able to stay on it for a week and loose some water pounds, but you will not be able to survive on this one. Look for something else if you want to loose weight that will stay off 
 Sugrue's thesis in this book is that endemic racism (along with economic decline) is responsible for Detroit being largely Black, poor and greatly in decline.  He's a revisionist historian who wants to refute older narratives that Detroit is corrupt (because all the city governments after 1967 have been run by Democrats and Blacks).  Instead he attempts to refute that by showing the deeply ingrained racism in the community.  Sugrue's attempt at political polemics is bad history.  He fails to mention the obvious: Detroit is over-taxed and run by incompetent, corrupt politicians.  It's public unions have caused government workers to be some of the highest paid in the country with little to show for it.  This is thanks to former-Mayor Young who instituted an arbitration law.  To pay for this, the city's taxes are exorbitant which pushes businesses further out.  Because of this, Detroit never found other businesses to take the place of the declining auto-industry which has inflated pay for its jobs in the first place.  Of the past three mayors, two have been highly corrupt.  Archer who was mayor in the '90s, after a distinguished career in the state Supreme Court, tried to reform the city but was kicked out of office.  Young and the current mayor, Kilpatrick, are very corrupt.  Just do a google news search of "Kwame Kilpatrick" and "corrupt" and you'll see the various scandals that have plagued him.  Other than stealing city funds for himself and his family he turned down a $200,000,000 private gift to the city for charter schools because the teacher's unions were against it.  Young, mayor in the '70s and '80s, made room for a GM plant by confiscating private land through eminent domain.  Few could understand why he buldozed tax producing land when he could have given over acres of abandoned property, except that the residents of that neighborhood voted overwhelmingly against him.  Yes, white people with means fled Detroit for the suburbs.  But Sugrue glosses over that fact that middle class Black residents left as soon as the could too.  Southfield, a surburb township, is overwhelming Black and middle class, populated by those who couldn't stand the crime and corruption of Detroit.  Far from being an example of a typical post-industrial American City, Detroit is the exception.  It should be held up as a prime example of how not to run a city.  That being said, unless you've been assigned this book, don't read it.  Sugrue gives excuses and vague general reasons (aka racism) for Detroit's decline when the real problems are staring him in the fac 
 The positive reviewers are mousy especially Akon. Akon was never heard of until last year when it was his debut. What corporate buisness today is giving out the free record deals (as everyone intelligent says) and pick strangers from out of the street, dress them up, don't have the inspiration of writing their songs by themselves, and is a get-cash-quick scheme? MTV. I have more than the rights to say that this album that everyone you see that will love this, has a possible chance that their IQ is lower than average. We can't stop this madness. It was too late when MTV Networks (Independent MTV) sold to Viacom.  Regarding to Akon's first album, I have heard the song 'Lonely', only that Bobby Vinton should sue him for speeding up the pitch of Vinton's classic track 'Mr. Lonely'. Vinton doesn't deserve the ignorancy correlation that nobody that was born after Vinton's time haven't known 'Mr. Lonely'. He should sue, and I hope and pray to God this will get Akon's career to the incinerator, and to black ashes.  If your personality is the antonym of the word 'mind-lacking', then you should not buy this album like me. But, the people today on planet Earth are estimated 68% ignorant! It's up to our duty to reduce the percantage of ignorancy, and not to fall blindly into MTV. All in favour? AYE! All opposed? (dead silence).  As to my intelligence, I like music that isn't mainstream today. Listen to all the genrés that don't influence money 
 It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points:  1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected?   2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?  3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs?   4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women.   5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.  6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women.   7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.  8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.  This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction.  In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.  In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy?  The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation. Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart.  At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, has been awarded France's Legion d'Honneur, Italy's Grinzane Cavour and was inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 2002. "Veronika Decides to Die" is his twelfth book and was first published in 1998.    The story begins in late 1997 and follows the story of Veronika - a twenty four year old woman living in Slovenia. The book begins with her attempted suicide : however, having overdosed on tranquilisers, she is discovered in time and taken to hospital before she dies. The hospital in question is Vilette - a well known asylum in Ljubljana. Although she has survived, she is told - due to the damage the tranquilisers have done to her heart - she only has about a week to live. Having always kept herself firmly under control, Veronika finds herself broadening her range of experiences and feelings, and gradually comes to see her life as something worth living. Her arrival in Vilette also has an impact on some of the asylum's other patients - specifically, Eduard (a schizophrenic), Zedka (who suffers from depression) and Mari (who suffers from panic attacks).   This is an absolutely awful book : rather than "beautiful", "poetic" or "inspiring", I've never found writing so bland. Despite her situation, Coelho finds himself incapable of establishing any empathy with or sympathy for Veronika. In fact, I even think he wrote about the wrong character - Zedka's story, in the hands of an author up to the task, is a story I'd rather have heard. Coelho's decision to include himself in the story stank of ego, and the way that he wrote that section ("Paulo Coelho wanted to know all the details of what had happened" rather than "I wanted to know all the details of what had happened") was really irritating. The only apparent hobby the patients had - a solitary pastime known to some as 'merchant banking' - was given too high a profile : Veronika's activities on this front were irrelevant and did nothing to help the story. Then again, Coelho has spent some time in an asylum as a patient - perhaps he knows something I don't. Unfortunately, he just doesn't seem capable of putting what he knows into words : avoid this book at all costs. 
 I heard about this book and was going to buy it, but from what I read it seems to refer to the Firefighters as male.  Being a FEMALE Firefighter, I was going to buy it for my loved ones to read, but felt that it really did not apply to me.  What a huge disappointment.  Just when I thought there was a book to help people understand what it is like to live with a Firefighter, I find out that it only applies to the loved ones of the Male Firefighters.  Sorry, this isn't supposed to be a Women's rights kind of blog, but we are into another whole millenium...is it still not known that there ARE female firefighters out there?? 
 First, I must state that my comments are based on browsing this bookstore at my local bookstore. Having said that, I would also like to state that I can understand the secrets behind most of these techniques without really making a detailed reading.   So, I wanted to quickly get a sense of  what techniques the authors uses. Specifically, I wanted to see if his techniques can be extended to multiply three or more digit numbers. No surprise. The method cannot.  (I am not interested in techniques for special numbers. Those may be good, but I want a general method.)  The author introduces the Reference Method to multiply two numbers together such as 97 x 98. Most of us, when confronted with this will be stumped on how to multiply this in their heads. However, by recognizing that both these numbers are close to 100, and that 100 x 100 is easy, a simple technique can then be devised to "correct" for the deviation from 100. The technique is based on the simple algebraic equation (which the author doesn't state, but if he did, it would make the Reference Method a lot easier to remember than going through the reams of pages he devotes to the explanation): 97 x 98 = (100-3)x(100-2) = 100 x 100 (easy) -100(2 + 3)(easy) + 6 = 10,000 - 500 + 6 = 9500 + 6 = 9506. The "Reference number" is 100 and gives the starting point as 10,000. But what happens when we want to multiply 13 x 54? In this case, we would like to start out with 10 (for 13) and 50 (for 54) giving us 10 x 50 = 500. In other words, we use 2 Reference Numbers: 10 and 50. Next, we make the corrections from here. Once again, the basic algebraic equation doesn't change: (10 + 3)X(50 + 4). But, now the steps to make the correction increase. And, mind you, you have to memorize all these steps.   But, here is the killer: To extend the Reference Method  to multiply large numbers becomes onerous. For simplicity, try this multiplication which only uses 1 Reference number, 200: 187 x 183. This leads to (200-13)x(200-17). And, now you have to multiply 13x17 in your head, which is not as simple as say, 5x6. In other words, you have to apply the same technique to multiply 13x17, using either 10 or 20 as your Reference Number. Then, you will need to use this result for the original number, that is if you are not thoroughly confused by now.   The author, of course, argues that with practice, this becomes easy. While this may be true, there is a lot of pain involved to get there, and there is no guarantee that you will remember these steps always. Most likely, you will forget them.   Not only his the technique of Reference Methods poor in that it cannot be extended, it's very poorly presented.   After his disastrous attempt to demonstrate multiplication, I did not bother to browse further but promptly put the book back on the shelf.  The Tractenberg System is far superior, easier, scalable to numbers with greater digits (for example, I have no problem in multiplying 1234 x 342 in my head) and the technique is consistent for digits of all lengths. The author does mention this method in his preface to this book. He should have ended his book at that.   I am sure that using Tractenberg's system, I can beat the author in multiplying numbers. 
 While I enjoyed the read from a purely entertaining and pride perspective, I found the book fairly unrepresentative of the Corps as a whole.  As a graduate, I know what life at West Point is like, and how the Corps thinks and acts.  It is unfortunate that Mr. Lipsky chose such a narrow prism of cadets to portray as the whole.  For those who truly want a sense of what life at USMA is like, do yourself a favor and visit 
 OK, here's how you're supposed to use the Apple Remote with an iPod. Plug the iPod into the new Universal Dock, turn the iPod on, select a playlist, grab the remote, sit down in your chair, start playing music. Now, do you want to change playlists or adjust some other setting on your iPod? Well guess what? The menu button on the Apple Remote doesn't work with iPods. So you have to get up, go across the room to where the iPod is plugged into the stereo and change the settings on the iPod. So what can you do with this remote with an iPod. Well you can pause songs, you can increase or decrease the volume and you can skip back or forth through songs in a playlist. Basically this is the iPod equivalent of a 1960s TV remote control. It's a complete waste of money because you can't browse your playlists or change settings on the iPod. I don't know what Steve Jobs was thinking when this piece of junk was released, or what he was smoking. Summary: AVOID 
 there are 2 destructive mentalities that are prevelant and also extremely popular amongst black men in america today. one of them is this new hip hop mentality of hustling coke, thugging out, having lots of sex and arguing that school/education/white collar jobs are for the birds. the second mentality is that hustling coke, being a thug, and having lots of sex is BAD for you, but it is also a product of years of oppression and white racism as is an education and working a white collar job (AKA being an uncle tom)...I will let your own practical reasoning complete my point for you.   I read this book when I was a teenager and very militant. I've outgrown this mentality and most of the people that will read it will too. I recommend it just to get a better understanding of the different schools of thought that exist within our community, but If you plan on being a productive citizen, have a good job, have a wife and some kids one day - or how should i put it - BE AN UNCLE TOM, then stay away from the mentality in this book. 
 a coffee table book come to life, ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting; you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid-20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it. 
 Sam is shocked when her husband decides he wants to divorce, even though she knew they had been growing apart for some time.  The news crushes her, and she deals with it by going to Tiffany's and spending $12,00.00 on things she doesn't really want.  Her husband's response is mild exasperation and a warning that he's moved most of the money out of the checking account where it will be safe.  Are you kidding me?  Are these supposed to be real people acting this way?  What follows is a series of events of unbelievable good luck as Sam alternates between feeling sorry for herself and acting absolutely crazy in a quest to be the perfect housewife and mother. A good example of the latter is when she cooks an entire Thanksgiving dinner, including a twenty-one pound turkey and several pies, although she is spending the day entirely alone.  Despite her erratic behavior, Sam manages to find the perfect woman to move in with her--a grandmotherly woman who helps her recover from her heartache.  Sam also begins a series of temp jobs and meets a brilliant and sweet man who loves her enough to totally change himself for her.  Throughout everything, Sam's husband continues to support her financially.  They don't fight over their son and her husband is even tolerant of Sam's crazy phone calls.  If this is what divorced life is like, I'm surprised more women don't go for it.   
 Having an advanced degree in Sociology and also having personal relationships with members of Old Order Groups does not make me an unbiased reviewer of this work. As it stands, I believe it takes a very conservative and functional perspective on the dynamic groups of these people and does not even begin to address the integration of change and conflict within these groups in anything ut a very superficial way. A shame, as I was hoping for a more dynamic read than a functionalist perspective of very diverse and dynamic subgroups.  As it stands, I found the work not truly willing or able to explore deviance, social control, conflict or the realism of the daily lives of these peoples as they struggle with their religious lifestyle and the world around them. As stated, it was a descriptive work from a functionalist perspective. Too bad as the subject and persons are far more interesting than the authors would have left one to believe, especially when living among those people in communities and thier true impact on the larger secular society around them as I have seen 
 The authors must certainly be experienced in building and the various trades but this book just didn't help me at all.  A total flop for me, really.  The book to get for the first time Owner-Builder is the Complete Guide to Contracting Your Home, by McGuerty & Lester.  A wonderful step-by-step guide with TONS of useful information 
 Being a Mortgage Broker, when I saw the title I thought it would be a good book for my industry - wrong! This is the second Guerilla series book I have purchased and I have been disappointed with both. The title mentioned more about the business of Mortgage Brokers than the text of the book. The author put a few Mortgage Buzz words in the text but it had no real meat for the Mortgage business or any business. If someone finds this book a good buy then they should not be in business for themselves since the content is just simple common sense. Also, the big turn off was when the author compared Marketing to 'Good Sex.' That statement alone shows he has no class! Instead of putting the book on my bookshelf, I put it where it belongs - the trash!  
 Why do the record companies continue to put out albums, with LIVE cuts on them??  If I wanted a LIVE album, I would buy a LIVE album.  I was going to purchase this CD, but changed my mind because of the LIVE cuts.  
  If you're not offended by the contents of this book, there are three possibilities: 1) You live in a compound prostrate to a tyrannical religious leader who allows you little to no access to the outside world. 2) You're regularly featured in D Magazine. 3) You sustained a serious brain bleed while concentrating on 33 Down in National Enquirer's weekly crossword puzzle.   The main character, never named by the author, takes us along on her daily travails that involve such hardships as agonizing whether to turn down a flight on a private jet with a married man or fly commercial, considering whether to become friends with a woman who wears last-season's Manolos, and debating whether it would be really wrong to sleep with her best friend's boyfriend multiple times since she already slept with him once.   The sad thing is for a book that chronicles the lives of young, New York socialites who have everything and want much more, it doesn't offer its readers much of anything. The plot never thickens. The characters never take on dimension. We just end up following no name around to her parties, showers, waxing appointments, shopping expeditions, and boyfriends' bedrooms (hers or someone else's). While some might consider the ride fun and the vernacular (totally beyond, moi, tres chic, etc.) cute, most readers will tire of it by the end of the first chapter.   The only thing the book offers of any value is an insight into a twisted subculture of totally selfabsorbed, impossibly superficial, anorexia-endorsing ninnies who make us feel much better about springing for that new pair of shoelaces when we just could have laundered the old ones 
 One needs only two Sex Pistols' albums: "Never Mind the Bollocks" and "Rock n Roll Swindle." There's just nothing out there that even remotely resembles the Pistols' version of 'Roadrunner' ("Steve, wait...wait....I don't know the f'n words!") and the pieces by Jones and Cook are excellent, and a great preview of their work together in The Professionals. For those who wish to go deeper, in addition to "Swindle" and "Bollocks," I'd recommend John Lydon's first album with PIL featuring "Religion I & II," ("Fat pig priest, sanctimonious smile...") along with PIL's greatest hits or Metal Box, also any work Lydon did with Leftfield, e.g. "Open Up"; anything by The Professionals is great ("I Didn't See It Coming"), and the soundtrack to 'Sid & Nancy' if only for the atmosphere provided by Pray for Rain and The Pogues. (By the way, if interested, you can probably find a few clips of Steve Jones and The Professionals in action on YouTube. Highly entertaining. 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 This book was a disappointment.  The photos are pretty, though lacking since they are more for artistic quality and do not show the finished product well.  The instructions are terrible.  I'd NEVER recommend this book 
 You know, I actually enjoyed the first Mummy. It was funny, the idea, not often seen in modern films, was good, and the characters were each, in their own way, entertaining to watch. Why, God, why did they have to go and make a sequel? I don't understand. Was it for the money??? I'm not sure when exactly I began to hate this; maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake AGAIN. Really, you'd think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it's thousand-year rest they'd learn their lesson. But oh, no; the first time wasn't enough.   And, also, the whole having a kid thing, didn't seem to work. The relationship between the characters wasn't the same anymore. I hate it when they do that in movies: make sequels and give the once-cool, main characters children. Nothing against it, just felt wrong for this movie.  Throughout most of this movie, I felt stupid, and I don't like for things to make me feel that way. I also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater. Maybe it's just me; I just didn't like it. Question of the day for American Cinema: What's the deal with being obsessed with sequels????? Come on, the first was good enough. You know what the worst thing is?-I was actually looking forward to seeing this 
 This books is just a laundry list of completely useless facts. One gets no personal insight into the individual. Note to self, never buy a biography, always read autobiographies. The difference is amazing. A person writing about their own life is infinitely more useful than an outsider writing about his interpretation of that person's life. 
 Weak, weak, so very weak. Just as weak startups should never be started in the first place, some books (about startups, the irony) should never be printed in the first place. A tear for the tree who got cut in order to print this book. Such waste.. 
 This book is nothing special. Imagine George R.R. Martin's a song of ice and fire but make it boring and hard to follow with a really so so narrative and no emotion-you'd get this book.  This is basically just like the normal Middle Ages, but with monsters and other creatures that are never explained. Take normal human conflicts, throw in some obscure stuff, and viola-here is the Kings Dragon, a boring and extremely typical fantasy book. I can't say I'd recommend it just because there's nothing really good about it (although, there's nothing bad either) and nothing grabbed my attention in any way. I won't continue on with the series and I'm not interested in this author anymore. Maybe this book is more for people who like intrigue fantasy or more normal fantasy books, stuff with nothing really fantastic in it, but this just wasn't my kind of book.  
 It fits in the cup holder and holds a lot. It's plastic inside and doesn't keep coffee or tea hot for very long and because it's metal outside you can't put it in the microwave. It's OK for a short drive to work, but not great for long drives where you want you coffee to stay hot 
 I found this book superficial, not very well written, and full of useless filler (like poor quality copies of readily available maps with no added information, like target areas).  I fish with both lures and bait, but prefer active fishing in the shallow bays, particularly those of the Texas Coastal Bend. I am no pro or tournament fisherman. I did hope to learn some new tricks.  The book is a major disappointment in that regard and I do not recommend it to anyone but a novice and perhaps those not yet familiar with the upper Texas coast. 
 out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny.  This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even  trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums,  Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel 
 I'm in Paris right now. And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There  will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a "duh". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London,  Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser. You're only embarrassing yourself by denouncing your origins and who you really are 
 A researcher I---and alot of others--- have immense respect for (and a great guy), Peter Whitmey of Canada, summed it up well: "I really don't see why we are wasting time analyzing and debunking every statement Judyth has made over the past few years.  I personally think this woman simply wants to insert herself into history, based on a possible fleeting connection to Lee Harvey Oswald, and the best thing we can do now is ignore her and get on with solving the crime." Good words from a well-respected man.   Avoid this book. [the "we" is in reference to the many researchers wasting their times chasing their tales and getting tied up in knots over someone who may have had a fleeting connection to LHO...my best friend's mom knew JFK: does that make her a grassy knoll shooter now???? :) 
 If there's a worse movie than this I haven't seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus tax plus gas to "run out" and buy this bomb. The only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a Greenwich Village "art house" and pass it off as a foreign film. Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ THIS! I later discovered after I wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50's. I understand that it is used constantly at the International Institute For Sleep Disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi-comcious near sleep state for incurable Insomniacs. And so as I write this update I've been watching the flick again and I must admit.....I.....(yawn) oh excuse me...where was I...oh yes I must admit that I.....(bigger yawn) Oh my goodness....I'm so sorry....This is so rude of me....(yawn) but it seems like.....(snoring)....I....(snoring) I just can't seem to (intense snoring)........ 
 I was given this book as a gag gift. I regret the day that I actually read it. Here's the basic message "Be good.", it's nice that so many adults are willing to be maniuplated by a statement that has haunted them since Kindergarten. If you need a solution merely "Being good" is not a solution. Change something within yourself. Don't avoid the actual problem. And most of all DON'T preach about this book to other people, they might sucker-punch you, I know I would 
 The book should have been titled " I have my cake and eat it too! A CD's guide to enablement and manipulation"  As a married CD in a committed relationship of 17 years. I was astonished on how self-absorbed and manipulative Dr. Novic came through in his "memoir." As a life-long admirer of the feminine, I do not perceive that he (and I mean "he") has an understanding of the feminine power that is within us all. He seems purely absorbed in obtaining sexual gratification. Which is fine, I just do not hold him as a positive representative of our closet community.  I also have dealt with mixing cross-dressing and the family. I am blessed with a supportive, open-minded wife who challenges me to be a better person and understands we possess both masculine and feminine in our psyche. To meet this challenge and keep my cross-dressing as a positive in our family, I have learned to cook, sew, do my equal share of housework, listen, nurture, care for our children and elderly relatives -- in essence, experience first-hand what a woman's role is. I am richer because of it. I still enjoy the sensuality of silks, wonderful garments and make-up, but we strive for balance and finding the "right place and the right time."  If you are a married CD, be careful about showing this book to your wife. My wife read it first and gave me the icy stare, "is this what you really want." I hadn't read it yet, so I had some bridge mending to do as I was guilty by association.   In summary, I did not increase my knowledge on the subject of cross-dressing nor did I see much of myself to relate this story. To me, Dr. Novic's memoir reads as an entitled, self-absorbed CD who has found a way to get it all and blame anyone (1st wife, parents, counselors) who got in his way. 
 Just to alert the prospective buyer- this volume is an adaptation by Deidre S. Laiken - not the unabridged versio 
 I found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about 20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content. The photography & art direction were exquisite 
 I ordered the Journal about a year ago and received 2 issues, and  never received another issue.  I contacted customer service about the problem, used the problem  report forms(or whatever it's called) and NEVER heard from them again.  I get this email today telling me to renew my subscription...  (after I had almost forgotten about the whole incident)    What nerve!!! I remember when I bought this a year ago, another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription.  Back then I just thought this would never happen to me..  (the same thing happened with Vogue magazine)  Boy was I wrong.  The 2 issues that I did receive were pretty good though.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but I would highly recommend getting  this from another vendor or ebay(they're usally cheaper too)  
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures.  I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality 
 This is a nothing book, I mean literally, this book contains NOTHING.  No story.   No plot.   No ending.  INCEST?.....there is none, there are not even any people in it 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I remember when I reached the end of Ilium, I thought to myself, "cool, I guess Olympos will be about the war of the gods vs. the Greeks and Trojans."  I mean, what else could the sequel be about really?  Achilles' mission to dethrone the gods, Zeus specifically, was definitely the focal point of the last 50 or so pages of Ilium, so obviously Olympos would focus on and resolve that.  Well, I guess obviously not.  Olympos turns out to be a rambling, incomprehensible mess of a story.  It turns out that that war between humans and gods is only the focus for about the first 100 pages, and then Simmons turns the focus of the novel into an abstract retelling of The Tempest, with characters that either we barely encountered in Ilium, or we didn't even meet at all.  Overall, the story in Olympos is just too fragmented to really make the reader care about what is going on.  As we try to keep track of roughly 7 different storylines, everything just starts to run together, and we slowly begin to stop caring about what is occurring.    I didn't completely hate the novel, though.  Much like Ilium, it has many strong moments, but Dan Simmons never builds on those strong moments to make the entire story stronger.  It seems like Simmons believe that if he thrown in a great segment every once in a while, the reader will forgive him for the rambling, incoherent mess that happens between those moments.  We are ultimately asked to care about characters for reasons that we have no reason to give a hoot.  With Ada and Harman, we are supposed to believe and care about their strong relationship with each other, but since they spend the entire book apart, their connection seems flimsy, at best.    By far the most frustrating part, though, is the anticlimactic finale that will leave you scratching your head.  You've just sat through roughly 1300 pages of story, and there is no climax.  None.  The book builds throughout all of its 700 pages to what you would think will be an amazing, jaw-dropping climax, but it's almost like Simmons is enjoying being withholding.  Instead of an exciting ending, we get a chance encounter/connection between two of the main storylines, and then we skip ahead to years after the conclusion of the events, and we are told in an objective, boring manner of what happened at the end.  Total disappointment 
 With such wonderful illustrations, and a mostly enjoyable text, it's too bad that this book gets its inspiration from "Twas The Night Before Christmas". Jewish parents work hard teaching their children that Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas. This book doesn't help. There are much better choices out there 
 Modern fascism has many faces and this author of one of them.  What common in these faces is profound and primitve ignorance, which is a basic ground of fascsism and anti-Semitism 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 This was bought for my daughter and the quality is absolutely horrible.  Talk about lowering your product standards to hit a price level.  The images on the box of the lit up crayons, dry erase markers, and the tracing piece are computer generated images.  If they showed true images, nobody would buy this.  
 Well, it ain't noir! Ellroy should sue for what has been done to his book.  What it is: It's incomprehensible, because most of the actors cannot enunciate. It's poorly acted - would someone please give Hartnett a day job away from the camera? It's campy. I haven't see a night club show like the All Lesbian Busby Berkeley Tribute in this movie since Robert Preston did his gig in Victor/Victoria. At least Preston had the talent and material to be funny. Here it was pointless, it served no purpose at all. It's overly complicated. Complex works great in the book, but on film all the subplots confuse and ultimately disappoint. And the camera work of the two men falling between the staircases was just too, too De Palma. I literally went, "oh, there's the trademark." Talk about suspending disbelief-- fuhgeddaboudit!   What it is, is a really bad movie. 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 While this book is considered groundbreaking because of the subject matter, sadly it is subpar in all other categories.  It read like a bad romance novel and I find it offensive that the writer uses stereotypical and incorrect pan-indian gender ideologies as the characters' inspiration for embracing their feelings and realization of their psychic crisis; examples of this are an old navajo woman prophesizes that the baby jess will walk a difficult path and gives her a ring of someone gender neutral (As I understand it in traditional dine gender roles there isn't really gender neutrality), the indians that work in the factory with jess are the only ones that accept the baby butch, and the red-headed transgendered character at the end saw an indian too when he discovered that he wanted to be a she. According to the author, if I were walking down the streets I could inspire millions of white people to put on dresses or bind their breasts. (...) So that and the writing is why I give this book 1 star 
 it basically is a series of bad resumes and good resumes. No real direct help in terms of resume writing. Just read the whole thing and infer lessons from each example. I was more hoping to see some more direct information or advice. How to approach each section of a resume etc 
 I was not impressed with the quality of this book.  The instructions are informative and easy to follow but the headpiece designes are out of date.  The pictures are hand drawn and do not capture the instructions they are depicting.  I have learned about the steps and general techniques of veil making after reading this book. However, I think  color photos and updated designes would be helpful 
 I've watched this film about 4 times.  I don't really know what it's about.  I should go out, buy a copy, and watch it about 10 more times.  The story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic.  It ends with a finding of a greater one.  In between there's a blur.  I think I'm going to buy it.  That's all 
 The CD#2 is wrong.  There is a manufacturing defect.  CD#2 is the same than CD#1.  Should be replaced.  I live abroad. How can be solved 
 My daughter was thrilled to get this for christmas with the rest of the set for the Little mommy doll.It came out of the box with easy basic instructions to put it together.BUT once it was put together my daughter went to put her doll in and it fell apart.Not the whole thing but the arm that holds the swing onto the base keeps falling off.My friends does the same nthing. Very cheaply made.Was not impressed at all. 
 ....and she's bad here!  Diana Ross hasn't put out a consistently good recording since "The Boss" and the Chic produced "Diana". She was always at her best when under the helm of strong producers such as Holland - Dozier - Holland (from her Supremes years), Ashford & Simpson, and the one time collaboration with Bernard Edwards and Nile Rogers. They seemed to know how to bring out her strong points and to minimize her weak ones.  When she takes more control of one of her projects - watch out! She doesn't do herself justice. Instead its usually an embarrassment, as is the case here.  With the long string of substandard recordings she's issued since "Diana", it doesn't seem likely she'll return to her glory days. But, others (Bettye Lavette, Candi Staton, etc.) have, so maybe there's still a good recording left in her some where 
 See Bonnie Raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs, actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `The Fundametal Things', but no 
 I read the first two books while on vacation: #1 had flat characters and some of the worst dialog I have ever read, but an interesting SciFi idea; I had to read #2 because I already bought it, and was happy to discover that the action had picked up. I was actually looking forward to #3, to see the business in New Britain develop along with the fallout from Matthias' actions.  Book #3 turned out to be a boring drag of more painful dialog with endless pages of uninteresting character background (DEA agent Mike) and Miriam complaining about her situation. I taught myself how to speed read to get through the dross to see if anything interesting happened (the last couple pages had some action).   Do you read the Robert Jordan books? Remember book #10 and how nothing happened? It got a 1.5 star rating only because you are not allowed to give zero stars. This book ranks right down there with that overbloat of filler material.  Read jaxamazon's summary and skip straight to #4 if you don't want to become bitter like me 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 Just another of the endless sagas, with much detail but little story!  The characters get on their horses and off, they tie them up, talk for a while, then get on again;  The author repeats this cycle over and over again with a little action thrown in every 70 pages or so!  If you love minute detail and endless repetition then you'll love this book 
 This luggage did not last for even one flight.  It was torn in the corners and the handles were broken.  I did contact the company and was given a full refund though 
       This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in  the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0<=w<=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if"We simply do not know!"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach 
 I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.  The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 The first thing to understand is that the book was originally written in French and most of Robinet's works are not available in English. I am not sure whether the translator caused problems in the layout of the text, or just Robinet's organization/thesis was poor to begin with, though I'd like to believe it was a poor translation.   This work lacks a cohesive purpose and never really gets into what Taoism is all about and certainly says nothing about its growth as a religion. If you knew nothing about Taoism going into this reading, you would be absolutely lost. The writing assumes you have substantial knowledge and explains very little along the lines of its references.   As it stands, it's useful to a person extremely well versed in this religion, Chinese tradition/medicine in general and also someone who knows the five-agent theory along with the I Ching. If you do not have this knowledge, steer clear of this rambling and sophomoric listing of other references (there are reference notes on almost half the pages).   Robinet's book here is touted on the back cover as investigating what the difference is between Philosophical and Religious Taoism, something it never truly does - that was the most glaring  defect I found in this work. I purchased it to get into that division, which I have always been interested in. This work simply lists out most Taoist texts, the time they were written and by whom.   It also spends the majority of the text going into shamanistic ritual in useless detail. Meaning, it does not clearly explain what was practiced, but lists out a rough procedure that was followed by adherents of Taoist related beliefs. It's also obvious that Robinet holds some disdain for both the religious aspect and its past followers, as there is a general negative overtone to the book regarding most older Taoist practices.   If this book had contained timelines and charts to clarify the inordinate amount of dates and works, I may have given it two stars. It also references diagrams that were not included in the translation and makes the almost unforgivable mistake twice in the text of mixing Yin and Yang concepts up (probably bad translation issues, but still questionable). It does have a great explanation of Yin and Yang in the beginning and also of the concept of Hun and Po soul division.   Here's who would benefit from this book: a serious scholar who owns many works on Taoism and lacks a general knowledge of when texts were written and an overall high level understanding of older Taoist rituals. Others will find much more value in almost any other work on Taoism, for founding history and a good background of Taoism's early development go with Elements of Taoism (Martin Palmer) 
 I rented this movie after hearing how funny it was.  Unfortunately, instead of laughing it just made me sad and angry.  The way the boy was treated was nothing short of child abuse.  I have a sick enough sense of humor that I like a lot of dark comedies, but this movie was just plain mean-spirited.  If they had left out the boy altogether is might have been funny. I can't recommend this 
 This book touches on some nice topics but if fails to state anything more then the obvious for anyone that knows anything about OO and the unified process.    I kept reading from one chapter to the next wondering where the actual detailed content was going to start but it never did.  On top of that it is written in such a boring way that I had trouble staying awake on numerous occasions.  Whether you're new to Computer Science or OO or have been in the industry for a while (as I have), you can do much better than this book 
 This book led me to believe it was about the oversexualization of preteen girls and the use of consumer marketing to further that end. Sorry, but there were way too many divergences from this topic and the authors contradicted themselves way too often for my taste. The authors used the book to push their political agendas instead of sticking to the subject. One major contradiction occurred when near the very end of a book full of pink-bashing and bashing mostly everything associated with being a female, they finally admit that wearing some of that stuff and doing some of that stuff is actually fun (which we all knew anyway, sheesh) They're also never satisfied...girls must play sports, but soccer has become too girlish for them; they found a tshirt that's not inappropriate, but it has a cute picture on it (yes, to these authors, mixing the word "cute" and girls is leading them down the path to looking like Bratz dolls one day), etc.  This book tells you to pick apart every movie, television show, toy, article of clothing, song and box of cereal. If after this examination, everything is not 100% politically correct (which to them means non-white, non-rich, non-middle class, non-attractive, and non-heterosexual girls must be depicted as never nuturing, cooking, or observing but always winning, leading, and doing so in non-pink clothes) I certainly think there should be less stereotypes for women and minorities depicted in such places, but these authors practically want girls who are blond, enjoy baking, take care of kids or animals, cheerlead, and do cleaning chores to never be represented in any media or marketing form. Talk about stereotyping! I think the authors forget the point is to see the actual people behind their skin or hair color, financial status, or sexual orientation. This books makes it sound like the worst thing ever is for a girl to want to be a wife and mother (especially of the stay-at-home variety)  That lifestyle may not be for every woman, but girls who include those things along with their other goals for themselves should certainly not be ashamed as the authors would like them. Nor should girls who enjoy cooking, horses, babysitting, wearing feminine (yet not slutty) clothes, playing with Barbie, playing "house", etc. be depicted as wrong and duped by marketers and society. Everybody is entitled to their own likes and dislikes (short of ax murdering, child molesting, terrorism and the like) and this book does not often respect that fact. The authors are correct in that we should teach our children to question what marketers present us and their motives. However, this book veers way off course and suggests that we question our kids to the extent that would ruin their enjoyment of too many things and ironically, cause them to no longer see the world in a color-blind, less judgmental way 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 The product description says to match Sony DCR-DVD105, which is completly FALSE. I just got the len and is worthless 
 Regarding the picture of Maria Barbella on page 36, I concur with the reviewer below 
 As is obvious from his title, Mr. Helminiak believes that he is able to provide special insight regarding Biblical teaching on homosexuality.  But he makes clear from the beginning that he does not really care what the Bible says: "As a Roman Catholic - and more importantly, a thinking person - I do not presume the Bible has the last word on sexual ethics" (19).  He approaches the Biblical text as though it had no Divine origin whatsoever.  He relegates God's description of homosexuality as "abomination" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13; cf. Prov. 6:16) to the Israelites' personal qualms about such activity: "The early Israelites considered it unclean. They thought it was dirty. They prohibited it not because it was wrong in itself but because it offended their religious worldview" (63).  Of course, God had no problems with offending the Israelites' religious worldview (cf. Ex. 32).  Helminiak will deny authorship of a passage if it conflicts with his prejudice.  In asserting that the sin of Sodom was actually "inhospitality," he cites a few passages (including the non-canonical Book of Wisdom) and concludes "The Bible often uses Sodom as an example of the worst sinfulness, but the concern is NEVER simply sexual acts" (49).  But in this section, Helminiak fails even to consider Jude 7, which establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that the sin and punishment of Sodom concerned sexual sins.  Obviously, I cannot endorse a book that violates Biblical teaching.  But for one looking to justify what the Bible clearly condemns, perhaps a better effort is made elsewhere 
 This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and lewss fluff, if you will. 
 I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.  Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone.  Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel.  There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy.  Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd. 
 I thought this would help soften our very firm mattress, it worked for maybe 5 minutes then I was sleeping in a hole... Your body just sinks down into this and all the padding goes out to the side.  Just a waste of money.  
 sorry this might be harsh but on my initial listen i knew this was something i didn't want.  its got that "over the top" produced feel to it.  lots of neat effects and great sound but nothing much else.  its not a real deep listening experience.  its cliche.  the fusion just went a bit too far here.  after repeated listens it just went completely flat.  this would make a wonderful sound track for disney's aladdin.    i'll gladly trade this cd for any of the thornton and ramzy cd's 
 "He loves me. He loves me. He really loves me," is just one example of this melodrama's inferior dialogue. This may be A&E, but it's no Andrew Davies production. Regardless of the presence of some very good names in the cast, the acting is incredibly superficial. "Catherine the Great" is merely a spectacle to dazzle its viewers with Zeta-Jones' beauty and a series of ornate sets and costumes. There is no time or depth committed to relationships between characters or important events. Battle scenes show comical swordfighting choreography . This film is an insult to fans of historical period dramas. I'm about ready to sell this one back. Not recommended. 
 I'm sorry, I was really disappointed with this book, disappointed enough to write my first amazon.com review.  The intention is great and as an owner of 3 rescue dogs I support the movement entirely.  However, I felt the book was a fast overview of dog ownership, touching on training, care and personal stories, but none of those areas were handled in enough detail.  I think this is particularly dangerous with the training section, which seems out-dated and emphasized correcting the dog more so than creating a scenario where the dog will succeed.    This is a great topic and an easy read, but I personally wish that the author would have done a detailed compilation of rescue stories.   
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
 After hearing mountains of praise for Discworld, I thought I'd give it a go. This book has completely turned me off to continuing the series. Pratchett has failed the fantasy genre where Adams has suceeded for sci-fi. The humor was helter-skelter and it seemed that Pratchett tried (too) hard to offer nonchalant zaniness 
 Title Should Be:  Just Another Six Sigma Book  I guess I'm the dumb one, because I was expecting a book that simplified and clarified the Six Sigma process.  After all, isn't that the purpose of the "for Dummies" series?  Well, this book does neither.  On page 2 of the book, near the top of the page, it says, "Six Sigma For Dummies is ... a comprehensive, actionable description of the methods and tools of Six Sigma."  A few lines later, however, it says that "...the field of Six Sigma is much too large to fit in only 400 pages."  This indecision on the authors' goals permeates the whole book.   The book has three authors, and as you read this book you suspect that they didn't collaborate at all on their approach to this topic.  For example, the statistics portion of the book is 165 pages long, with line after line after line after line of statistical info.  Then you get to the "tool" section of the book, where you will supposedly learn how to actually apply the statistics.  Even though at the beginning of this section it says, "You can't do Six Sigma without tools," the whole section of practitioner tools is less than 40 pages long.  Only a brief overview is given of each tool, without enough detail for anyone to actually do Six Sigma work!  Sure, statistics are important for Six Sigma, but for a person just being introduced to Six Sigma, the coverage is excessive and not done all that well.  If someone wants to learn statistics at this level, they would be far better off getting Basic Statistics, by Kiemele, Schmidt, and Berdine.  If someone wants a general reference book for Quality, including Six Sigma, get the massive (over 800 pages) The Six Sigma Handbook, by Thomas Pyzdek.  If someone wants a book that gives a practical and workable approach to Six Sigma in general, consider Statistics for Six Sigma Made Easy, by Brussee.    It isn't that anything presented in Six Sigma For Dummies is actually wrong.  It's just, as an earlier reviewer observed, that the book does not have a target audience.  And the book certainly doesn't fulfill the implied promise of a "dummies" book to simplify and clarify the subject.  Dedicated Black Bel 
 From the notion that slaveholders "were the worst victims of slavery" to the far-right myth that Carter's ending our LEASE on the Panama Canal was unconstituional and immoral, this book is right-wing  babble passing off as mainstream history.  Any distortion you could think  of is here - I guarantee it 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  I was really hoping for some inspirational tales of martial arts that would encourage me when I became unhappy with my own progress, but this book completely failed to deliver.  The meat of the book is Mr. Smith's stories of his own training in China.  In fact, it's not really about his training so much as it is a set of press realeases about the people he met during his training and outlandish stories involving them.  "Mr. Chan was the greatest <boxer, puncher, kicker, tai-chi master> in <northern, eastern, southern> China.  He once defeated 8 armed men and a mule while carrying six old ladies across the street."  This book is a waste of time 
 I found this book disappointing. The author goes to great pains to argue that it is hard to make a living in rural VT. This book seems like something the author and photographer did to pay their bills while living in rural VT, not because they had something to offer.  I found the book quite disjointed. It wasn't chronological, thematic, person-centered or anything else. I ended the book not having learned much about the people, their farming, or much else. The pictures were nice, but I wasn't really looking for a coffee table book; I was looking for a book about people farming on a small organic farm in VT, and did not get it 
 Stop me if you've heard this one:   So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world.   They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the "heathens" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany.   It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of "Hogan's Heroes," but it makes a lousy book.  Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another.   
 Sorry, but I can't recommend her books to any serious trader or student of trading; her books have been criticized for their cotton candy, hurah hurah motivational type writing which, frankly, is irritating after the 5th page, while at the same time, lacking any credible, scientific, and meaningful strategies for making money in the stock market. This one appears to be just a rehash of the earlier ones, written in a  more 'textual' type format. If you want a decent introduction to trading, try Link's High Probability Trading or Markham's Swing Trading. For more critique of Turner, see my review on her Day Trading book. Good luck aspiring traders everywhere 
 This router has to be one of the worst made products on the market, and has the poor customer service.  This router was defective out of the box, took 3 weeks of communication with Linksys's customer service before I finally just returned it and build my own router with the same functions 
 This book is an extremely wordy book and I did not get a clear direction for a practical training program, unlike Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot, which I would highly recommend 
  After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away. But this c d is directed at mothers with girls still living at home. How to raise them so they have self pride, integrity and can handle finances. Only the first tape talked about mothers and daughters over 35. It was a waste of my money. 
 Unless you are interested in a running commentary on the lead character's peek-a-boo clothes, this is not the book for a serious reader.  If there is any science fiction in this book I failed to find it.  I will be sure to NOT read any other books by C J Ryan.  I can only assume the author is a frustrated stripper wantabe 
 Usually a book is redeemable if it has one of two positives: a good plot (even if the writing isn't great) or fantastic writing (even if the plot isn't great). This book had neither. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and the so-called hilarity consisted of two jokes (an old woman having sex and spam email) that were dragged out the entire way through the novel. Plus, you can predict everything that's going to happen with every character from page 10.   Usually I pass all of my books along to friends when I'm finished, but this one went straight into the trashcan by the pool. I'm a fan of so-called beach reads but in this case, you'd be better off making a sand castle 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 I read this book for my History of Asia class.  As far as I know no one was impressed with it and had many problems with it. First, Foltz starts out speaking of religons that hardly anyone in the class had heard of as if we are supposed to know all about them.  He does explain them later, but in the first chapters he refrences them without giving any backround information.  Most of us were relativly inteligant and felt as if Fotlz were making fools of us.  I also felt as if he were stating assumtions rather than facts.  It was alot of information in a small amount of time and therefor had to follow 
 This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not.  The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best.  Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius. 
 Good organization and readability does not excuse publishers from using their business knowlege to stick it to students.  The "description" here doesn't do anything to change that impression.  Perhaps this book should have been called "How to Make a Killing in Academic Book Sales"  Obviously book buying is a new hazing rite for American students. "Yes, sir, may I have another! 
 From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).  Oh wait, there's more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors? The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it. 
 Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by "Ouida", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Rame, 1839-1908.  ISBN: 0192823280 
 This is a first draft book. Good ideas, poor execution, and totally failed by the editor to make it cohesive.  Our hero Christian, is the vampire who was the secondary character of the first book in the series. In that he was portrayed as a little crazy, pretty effeminate, and frankly unattractive.  But in this book he's magically tall, dark and Alpha. The heroine from the first book, ostensibly his "soul mate" married to another man, and her best friend have teamed up to find his "real" soul mate. It is never fully explained how he can have two.  But he does, and the second is named is Allie, another America in Europe. Allie is a summoner. She raises ghosts for a living, and has done so for 7 years despite never having raised a ghost before page 50. The author would have us believe in this universe ghosts are as debated as they are in ours but once Allie raises one she raises many and there is concrete proof of their existence. It's never explained why they are not believed in when they can be shown on film and are regularly.  Allie must aid Christian to find another Dark One, held captive by her evil boss who now wishes to possess Allie for...well, I'll be damned. Never did explain why. Inevitably she defeats her boss by discovering the hidden power in herself, made stronger by her bond with Christain.  The romantic tension is pretty good, even if the author uses ever romance cliché in the book (previous abusive husband, virginal attitude towards sex yet she gets real freaky real fast, and Christian is so self assured you want to smack him at certain points). The sex is surprisingly *yawn* boring and repetitive, very uninspired.  I bought it used for $3.95 and I wouldn't have paid any more for it. I wouldn't read the first (A Girl's Guide to Vampires - the ULTIMATE misnomer) at all, and this one only if you're REALLY bored and want a vamp book.  PS- she also shamelessly uses this book to set the stage for her Aisling Grey series. Thanks to the writing in this one I'll never bother with those books, and neither should you. 
 I cannot comment on the Fire Marshall who lost his life because I do not possess any knowledge regarding who he was, what he had done, or what he may have tried to do and I thank him for his courage and sacrifice.  However, I suggest Mr. Lance conduct more research on Nancy Floyd's background and her FBI service before writing or relaying anything she says as gospel.  The book reads like a thriller and I would give it four stars as a thriller. But because the author loses credibilty in his portrayal of Nancy Floyd, I give it an overall one star 
 I was intrigued by "The Replaement Killers." After seeing "The Professional" I became interested in the premise of a hit man with a heart. That the movie chose not to take this route was the first of many disappointments. It turns out that the hit man isn't really a professional at all. Instead he is killing in order to save his family. The first two killings went flawlessly, but when he is assigned to kill a child rather than criminals he can not bring himself to do it. That too is an interesting premise, albeit a much more familiar one, and it raises a separate set of questions: Why did he get involved with the crime-boss? If he has only killed two people how did his skill become so remarkable?      However, I must admit that I rented this because I felt a little blood-thirsty tonight and by the end it was definately quenched. It's just a shame that it didn't answer some very important questions. It did EARN its one star, I was moderately entertained but I felt two stars was too generous 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation (how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives?) and one-sided 'analysis'.  It is clear the Bin Ladin was 'lost' at Tora Bora when our troops were called back to garrison, allowing him to escape.  This goes even farther to the right than Micheal Moore goes to the left.  If you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several Administrations, read "Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror" by Richard Clarke.  If you buy this book, you are paying for propaganda 
 This book covers a huge range of Irish names, however only provides minimal information on each and coat of arms for the select few.  It provided the same information that is easily found on the web 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Very cultural but not attractive enough for my 2 yr old...colors are kind of dull.  Baby Einstein has much better books than this one 
 There is simply not enough room to refute the ideas concieved by Velikovsky. If you believe in his hypothesis's (remember, a theory has some evidence) then you owe it to yourself to risk these cherished beliefs. Many of the reviewers of Worlds in Collision who are lavishing praise on it claim the book is for those who have open minds. Anyone who considers themselves in possession of an open mind, and belives in the hypothesis advanced by Velikovsky HAS to read Carl Sagan's "Brocas Brain". This is a CHALLENGE. If you find yourself refusing to risk your beliefs by reading the rebuttel of one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century then you should realize that your beliefs stem from a emotional dependence on said beliefs, not a desire to view the universe openly. I had not realized fully the level of disilloushinment with mainstream science until I saw the reviews praising this book. Read this book, then read Brocas Brain. An unwillingness to expose oneself to counterarguments is the hallmark of the closed mind 
 An account of modern (post-Industrial Revolution) medicine's attempts to squish women under the juggernaut of progress by declaring them weak and/or unfit to achieve. While we here at History House are always suspicious of  any work with an obvious political agenda (printed by The Feminist Press),  the accounts of doctors and their loopy practices in the nineteenth century  are a hoot. If push came to shove, we would suspect some of the wilder  accounts given are probably minority views, but the prevailing notion of  women as fragile bits of fluff subject to the whims of their productive  systems was probably held by a majority of the docs during the period in  question. Besides, it's only about ninety pages. A good bathroom read.  [HistoryHouse.com 
 i cannot get thru this one.  i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear to have any good spots.  when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this, i thought, this has to be good.  i had just finished a movie where he starred.  can't remember the name of it.  i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it.  tori spelling is well known, but not to me.  someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start.  she does not play a flake very well, and i don't know what to call her except a flake.  i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot, but with tori spelling as one of the leads, i already know this one does not have a prayer.  i would say; save your money on this one unless you are under 13.  i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that don't.  this one falls into this category. one that came with this one was "the broken hearts club" and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage.   
 This movie is by far the worse of the Urban Legends movies. This is another movie I purchased without renting it first. Had I rented it first, I would not have bought this movie even though I did save money by buying it previously viewed. A group of high school friends start talking about the legend of Bloody Mary. Chanting her name will make her rise from the dead! Oh Boy. The whole movie boils down to the fact that Mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it. When Mary comes back to life, she seeks revenge on fellow classmates and kills them off. Not a good horror movie. No gore, no suspense. I would definetly recommend anyone rent this movie before buying it 
 I did not purchase this book.  I had the luxury of checking it out at my local library for FREE.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME buying this book.  I've read the majority of the book & I'm sick & tired of these author type people capitalizing on other people's desires and emotions.  FACT:  Everyone wants to be rich and have a more comfortable lifestyle.  Do not lead people to buy your book if you cannot present them with useable knowledge!  I will save you the hours of time it takes to read this waste of time & tell you what the authors are trying to tell you.  This is their hidden message........"Find a really good idea & go for it!"  Wow!  Great idea!  News to me?  I think not.  That's it.  The whole book boiled down to that.  There are plenty of good books out there for any interested in becoming wealthier and/or living a more comfortable lifestyle.  This isn't one 
 I run hot and cold with Clint Eastwood. Hot with movies like "Outlaw Josey Wales", and "Dirty Harry". "Unforgiven" ranks right up there with  "Bridges of Madison County" as two of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Sorry fans 
 Although I wanted to like this book, I didn't.  There is no central narrative here to tie one anticdote to another, and when something interesting does happen, it is usually described in an off-hand way.  Things happen, but the characters (although Joan is really the only one) show no growth 
 While there was some useful information,this book appeared to be an effort to prove Ms. Vencent's prejudices, rather than the voyge of discovery that it could have been. The author seemed to be searching for the very worst in men, and of course, she found it.  The fact that she would join a men's bowling league, when she couldn't bowl was simply amazing.  I don't think a man (or most women) would ever consider doing such a thing. In addition to the lack of substance, I feel the book was written in a very unengaging and simplistic style. Overall, it was one of the few books I have bought over the years that I don't believe was worth the money.  If you must buy this book, find a used one, or better yet, get it from the library.  If I ever see another book written by Ms. Vincent, I will pass 
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 This book is out of date, and the "famous director tales" are only a few pages in length each.  Not worth the money.  Would be interesting to see how this book would look if were written today, with the  impact of DV 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 I read this book during the break in seasons 2 and 3.  Besides the thorough section devoted to the producer's influences--the parallels to "The Stand" and "The X-Files" are interesting--it was a waste of time.  It left me wondering what audience they were targeting with this book--huge Lost fans who are involved in the intertextuality of the show know all of this already, and casual fans won't be bothered by buying books.  I also noticed that there is no speculation whatsoever in the book, and that it sticks to the basic facts that we all know already.  Plus, it was written before the last episodes of season 2, which are critical to "unlocking" any meaning behind the show.  Don't buy it 
 The author clearly knows their topic. It is a pity they are unable to develop a clear and compelling narrative to the life of Henry II.  Details, then details within details, thicken this soupy "read" until all sense of pleasure and color in reading about the life of Henry II evaporate. This is not a book for the general reader, even one with much background in the Middle Ages.  Instead, "Henry II" is for scholars in search of finely woven exposition about the history of Henry II who do not require a flowing, interesting narrative 
 Paranormal romances are not usually my thing, but I was out of town and desperate for something to read so I picked it up in the hotel gift shop.  Well, I made a very poor choice.  For the three days I was holed up in the hotel room I tried to read this crappy book and when I checked out I left it in the trash can.  The plot was silly and unrealistic -- even for this genre.  The characters were one dimensional caricature in no way believeable -- even for this genre.  This was a complete waste of money 
 In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass 
 These are horrible, I have small ears and these keep popping off my head, and hurt to wear.  I couldn't get these off my head fast enough.  
 "The Devil and Sonny Liston" is so shallow that it can be read in an hour. Be forewarned that it would be a wasted hour. The book rambles and meanders and ducks down many a rabbit hole with the end result that the public perception of Sonny Liston as nothing more than a cloddish, criminal thug remains unchanged. There is no depth here at all. Stale rumors, recycled innuendos, and anecdotes by Liston flunkys hardly add up to a serious character study.  Much of this book deals with the mob's influence on professional boxing during the Liston era and mob-groupie Tosches is not above flat-out invention to move his narrative. He blithely claims that Rocky Marciano's last fight, against Archie Moore, was "fixed" by the mob, that Moore took a dive. What nonsense. Moore was a 4-1 underdog in that fight. The whole point of "fixing" a fight is to get the favorite to agree to lose and then clean up by betting on the underdog. It makes no sense to pay the expected loser to lose. Moore took an incredible battering in that fight and it never appeared like he was looking for a comfortable place to flop.  Sonny Liston here is more of a lengthy footnote than a biographical subject. He's not so much elusive as he is MIA, lost under a welter of trivialities. At one point Tosches waxes poetic about the length and girth of Liston's manhood. Testimonials are included.  
 It's almost unbelivable how they completley made these good songs pure garbage... most songs are remixed incredibly bad , only one song stand out which is the remix to 2 OF AMERIKKAZ MOST with Crooked I instead of Snoop, however the orginal is much better...   Don't waste your time on this BS, Suge only wanted to get easy money... 
 What happened?  I enjoy Beyonce's powerful voice where the "power" is in the buildup of the song.  This cd is screaming not singing!  Disappointing.  I only like the two singles Deja vu and Irreplaceable. I hope her next cd is better, a little closer to the first solo release please. I'm still a fan but will not buy her next cd without hearing it first 
 I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry 
 This teacup has a beautiful design, but I was very disappointed when I received it.  The cup and saucer were much thicker than I would have expected for a china teacup!  It also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer.  I sent it back as I could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Very bad, doesn't explain the meaning of the masonry.  Do not waste your time unless your a genius about the masonry, I didn't understand anything about it and he didn't even say what they were 
 I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck.  I HATE IT!!  My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there.  Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.  Why buy extra toys??  I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys.  I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange.  What a waste of money for me.  I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too.  My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym.  Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys.  
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.  I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable. 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 First things first.  The most important thing to recognize about this book is that the majority of it (about 2/3) was not actually written by Jesse Livermore.  It was written by Richard Smitten, a man who tries (and fails miserably) to create a sort of monologue of Livermore, complete with phony quotation marks, in which the great trader outlines his system.  Having said that, Livermore's actual writings are very interesting.  The first few chapters of the book is a word for word transcript of Livermore's original text, and contains much in the way of useful insight and helpful tips and information.  The Livermore Market Key at the end of the book is also Livermore's creation, and it, too, is useful in its own way. 	 The rest of the book is cobbled together by Richard Smitten, a man who seems to have made it his life's work to piggyback on Livermore's success in order to make a name for himself.  Smitten took letters and interview transcripts and pieced together a phony Livermore monologue.  It is unconvincing and a complete waste of time.  The writing is abysmal, and Livermore's concise points and techniques (from the first part of the book, the part Livermore actually wrote) are repeated over and over and befuddled to the point that you have to remember that it is not actually Livermore speaking.  Smitten's attempt to adopt Livermore's style of conversation fails miserably, and the whole of his work is tedious to the power of ten.  I couldn't even get through it-I had to skip to the Livermore Market Key at the back.    The book also contains some shameless self-promotion in which Smitten attempts to peddle his biography of Livermore onto the reader and also his trading system, which he shamelessly claims will help you trade like the great legend.  Smitten's writing is so awful I would never even consider anything else written by him-his seeming inability to create a concise sentence without a run on and his ineptitude at using question marks when necessary waxes tiresome in a hurry.  The best book about Livermore's trading style is Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and that book will get you closer to understanding the real Jesse Livermore than this drivel ever will.  Aside from Livermore's own words (the only redeeming factor here), this book is utterly useless 
 This collection of essays is a complete joke. Christian Kim is completely ignorant of Jewish law. These essays are incoherent and poorly argued. Many key historical facts have been distorted, omitted and even invented to fit Kim's crazy arguments. It seems to me that Kim is on a crusade to destroy Jews and Israel. I would stay well away from this book, it really is crap 
 I bought this book as an impulse after seeing it contained eleven practice exams, plenty of practice. However, the questions are terrible representations of actual questions, the answers are often mistyped, and wrong portions of sentences are underlined. The format of the book is not conducive to a true test either. If you are studying for the PSAT I recommend getting the Princeton book and a solid SAT II Writing book. Don't be conned by the many practice exams inside, they won't help you at all 
 If you're hoping for that "dishy," tell-all, spicy account of Tallulah's life, this ISN'T it!  That bio is still to be written.  This attempt at capturing the essence of the grande dame suffers from two fatal diseases:  tedium and barely tolerable--lethal combinations in any dose.  And, there are glaring errors of fact.  Someone fell asleep at the research table!  Better to view some of la Bankhead's films than try to wade through these waters.  Anyone got a Lifeboat?!! 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real. 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 With all the publicity this book got I thought I would learn something I didn't know.  Very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning.  Very disappointed 
 This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as "an offshoot of Islam", and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes 
 The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it 
 I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive.  A movie that I would highly recommend. 
 Creationist A: Boy, am I getting frustrated.  The evolutionists have an incredible amount to evidence that's really hard to refute.  I mean, WE true believers know they're wrong, but to the general public, let's face it, the evolutionist case just looks too good.  They got TONS of science on their side. What can we do?  Creationist B: How about this. Why don't we get someone to write a book that says there are complex biological features that could not evolve because the parts they're made up of couldn't function alone.   CA: But haven't we already tried that dozens of times in various ways?  I mean, the evolutionists have always said that looking at complex end products doesn't tell the full story.  And you gotta admit, that makes sense.  I mean, the whole point they make is that biological features evolve in a slow, step by step process over huge spans of time, one small change at a time. In the meantime, they say, the transitional forms could become extinct, making it seem like a complex form came out of nowhere. Like I said, this is frustrating.  CB: You're missing the point.  I know a guy who's a biochemist.  He can write up something using all the technical jargon.  He can even get into things like genetics and DNA and all that stuff and make it sound really convincing. I mean, it's not gonna fool biologists or biochemists but let's face it, THEY aren't the ones we're trying to fool.  We'll call it "intelligent design" instead of "creationism" .  We'll try to make it sound like it's something new.  People won't know what to think. When they see it on bookstore shelves, a lot of people might just think it's actually a legitimate science book.  What are they gonna do?  Go out and take advanced university courses in biology and chemistry to find out for themselves?  They're gonna think it's real.  CA: I get it. You just want to deliberately create confusion among the general public by writing over their heads, even if you know what you've written is garbage.  CB.  Precisely.  CA: Very sneaky!  I like the way you think.  Let's just hope those people don't bother to look at other sources of information.  They might just find out this ID stuff is baloney.  CB:  Shhh!!!  You'll give it away!! 
  Kim is nothing but a publicity tramp with no class or style. Please stop buying her albums b/c to me, it sounds like stereo porn. Great female MCs to check out: Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Roxanne Shante, even Salt N Pepa. What do they have in common? They were pioneers who didn't sell music with horrible lyrics and had class at the same time. So don't buy any of Kim's records and get something from the ladies I listed above. So now, your stereo system should be playing the right music 
 Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads "Tell No One." Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.   I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end 
 I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 I'm sorry to say that this plot reminded me of a piece of clothing: continually washed, scrubbed, bleached, dried, and washed again. The book starts with another kid who has been forced to go live with a boring relative for a while because of parent problems. How many times have we heard that one? Molly's mother is a drug addict so she is sent to live with her retired nurse Aunt Fay. In her new neighborhood she communicates with a boy named Will, and their relashionship eventually deepens to a weak, unconvincing love. Molly also meets Mrs. Voorhees, a charectar whom I found extremely annoying because of her rash conversations and greedy nature. Even so, this book is not terrible. Molly is realistic in some ways and many charectars can come through instead of sitting, trapped, in that haze that results from bad writing. But on the whole, it's another adolescent book with a "never-see-Mother-again" feel that concludes for a very poor read. If you do pick this book up, do not have high standards. Peck has some other books that are better; read those instead of this 
 While this book provides a decent cursory review of East Europe, it is not to be taken as an authority on the subject.  Many times, Roskin will oversimplify political agendas and use imprecise vocabulary to describe his subjects.  For a comprehensive look at the political factors of the area, I would suggest something more along the lines of Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy 
 I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to books. I picked this one up at a bookstore, intrigued by the historical fiction aspect of it and that it was about a reign (King George I) that wasn't often written about. I also picked it because I love a good personal mystery, and all the characters were hiding something.  This book was very disappointing, because it's barely historical fiction. I think the author used the setting more for the manners and clothes, rather than fully exploring the rich possibilities the era gave. The most disappointing aspect was Roger's "big secret," which is alluded to throughout the first half and is exposed in the second half. The secret is a terrible letdown, as most readers will guess it within the first few mentions. Moreover, the historical aspect regarding Roger's secret is totally ignored, and makes me wonder if the author did her research at all, or if she did research and just wanted us to put 20th century mores into 18th century characters 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 This book was suggested reference material for a college course of study at FIDM.  Initially I thought this was a paperback condensed version of the hardback book.  Upon receipt I found it extremely difficult to read without a magnifying glass - the print is literally micro-small.  At first I blamed my aging eyes, but my nineteen year-old daughter whom I purchased the book for has 20/20 vision, and she expressed a similar opinion.  I would not recommend this version of the book - if you have the option, purchase the full size hard bound copy 
 My son flew the plane once and it was broken after the first flight.  Not sturdy, nose and wing broke.  Don't purchas 
 Mr. Mef will always have a very soft-spot in my heart. As a hardcore Clan head, Meth has always been one of my favorite rappers in the game, with his gruff, but smooth delivery, and rhymes so witty, you'd press "Rewind" every ten seconds. The P-A-N-T-Y-R-A-I-D-E-R made a name for himself in Enter The Wu-Tang, and he followed up his amazing performance there with the first Clan solo album, Tical.   Tical was fantastic. The Iron Lung showed where he was coming from, as each track on that album was streaming with gold, and to this day, it remains one of my top ten hip-hop albums. However, something seemed to happen.  Meth had some classic guest appearances throughout the early nineties, with fellow Clan members, and friends outside of the circle(most notably, Notorious B.I.G. and Redman). Wu-Tang Forever dropped, and Meth was still in top-form. Then something curious happened. The long awaited sequel to Tical, Tical 2000: Judgement Day dropped, and it was, to put it gently, not too good. His album with Redman, Black Out, holds on that same opinion. Many, many guest appearance later, and Meth dropped his third solo LP, Tical 0, and to say that stunk would be an understatement.  I wanted to like this album. The Wu's been putting out some great releases in the last couple years, mainly from Ghostface, GZA, and Masta Killa. I wanted to believe that Mr. Meth could drop a FishScale, a Grandmasters, or a No Said Date. I wanted this so badly.  We can't always get what we want.  There's one thing that Clan heads know, and that is the production the original members sound best flowing over. Ghostface sounds best over soul samples, Inspectah Deck over funk, GZA over gritty, yet epic beats, Raekwon over theatrical beats, etc. Method Man sounds best over the gritty, yet funky production that only RZA can provide, and on the cuts RZA does produce, this album shines. However, when Method Man takes the Scott Storch rote, and flows over polished, and overproduced beats, he just sounds so misplaced.   This album is highly dissapointing. While it isn't completely worthless, do to a few of the great cuts(The Glide, 4:20, Presidential MC's), it could've been done without. This album is Tical 0 with a few RZA joints on it; that's all. I still love Meth, don't get me wrong, but this album is just another stain on his respectable legacy.  Sorry, Johnny, but a lot of things have changed in the last 13 years, and none of them have been for the better 
 The general content in the area of how-to was ok, but with so much reference to open reel tapes and minimal to digital recording made it disapointing.  Copyright dated 1988, 1994, the changes not covered that have taken place in the last five years are amazing.  The pointers on mic-ing are good, along with ideas on getting cleaner recorded tracks.  I am getting a lot more out of "Home Recording Power!" by Ben Milstead.  It is slanted toward the CakeWalk Sonar software, but gets things moving fast!  The sugestions are current as well 
 Intersection started with a disadvantage in that it's a remake of one of my favorite films, Les Choses de la Vie. The original uses a terrible car crash (one of the best ever filmed) as a starting point for a series of flashbacks and reflections on the turning point in an architects life, when the relationship that ended his marriage is in danger of self-destructing because of his inability to make an effort. But where the accident is that film's focal point, replayed in various different ways as a kind of inescapable destiny, in Intersection it is used almost as an afterthought to bring some resolution to a mundane soap opera about an indecisive man torn between his career-conscious wife and his more liberal lover.  It's not a case of not giving the film a chance - there have been interesting re-workings of European films by Hollywood before - or expecting a raunchfest because of Gere or Stone's presence. It's just that it's really not very good.   The result isn't exactly unwatchable, but it is overwritten, over scored and surprisingly uncinematic. Rydell gives the film plenty of gloss but few cinematic flourishes, concentrating on the seen-it-all-before romance in a way that seems more TV movie of the week than anything worth paying to see on the big screen. Sharon Stone is superb as the ex-wife and Davidovitch does well as the lover despite some unfortunate and unnecessary scenes towards the end that undermine her character to make Gere look good - which brings me to the film's major failing. Gere's character and performance. Gere can act and has done good work, but this is an especially shallow and by-the-numbers ego trip more than a performance. Aside from being the screen's most unconvincing architect (and that includes Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal), the smug, self, narcissistic performance here prevents us from ever caring about whether the character lives or dies. Even the film's one nearly successful scene at a post office when he can't decide whether to post an important letter is ultimately destroyed by his hammy grandstanding phone call at the end of it.  Not that the script is any help. Scenes are overwritten, achingly obvious and horribly predictable, with everything spelled out in broad strokes. Ultimately you're just left wandering from predictable scene to predictable scene with little interest. Slick, watchable, forgettable, the final insult is that the novel and Claude Sautet film this misfire is based on is only acknowledged at the very, very end of the credits when no-one is likely to spot it. That said, the filmmakers are probably grateful not to be associated with this one.. 
 To charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any TV series is a crime. In this case it only adds insult to injury. This TV show was never fully appreciated, much less promoted in it's original run, which coincided with the early years of The Simpsons. But that can be credited to Fox Television's still relatively early, unsure of itself years when it wasn't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing. Nevertheless, that's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its DVD release. Chris Elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks, 30 year old paper boy. It gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on David Letterman (who can forget, the man under the stands, and his Marlon Brando routines on that show). Watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in "Cabin Boy," again, another unappreciated work. The wit and sarcasm are the same, as is the way he irks those around him, including his own folks, which includes his real life dad Bob Elliott of classic old time radio fame, and Elanor Donahue of "Father Knows Best" and "Andy Griffith," where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named Ellie. I give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves, which  was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around Elliotts' delivery and humor. On that it should get a 5, but the collection offered here is a disgrace. This show ranks as one of the top 2 TV shows to get cut short before given a fair chance, along with "Police Squad," which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via "The Naked Gun" movies. Elliott deserved better than just "Cabin Boy" towards that end. Try again on the DVD release boys. Either do it right, or it shouldn't have been done at all 
 There are a couple of good songs on here. I love the song Sunday Morning. But then they went and put crappy songs like "Hey Baby" and "Hella Good" on it, and it just went to hell. Plus all of their most overrated songs, which I just am not a big fan of. No Doubt was awesome up until Return Of Saturn, and Gwen's solo career just sucks horribly. 
 I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality.   Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.  Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.  If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat 
 What a chore this book was to read.  If it weren't for my OCD about finishing books that I start, I would've read the first couple of chapters and then given up.  It seems like a wannabe-suspense, but it's not.  It seems like there might be a love story in it, but there's not.  It feels like there might be a creepy angle in it, but there is not.  What I can gather about this book is that the author thinks she's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy.  She tries to make a connection, but falls WAY short.  Read Vinegar Hill - that one was worth it.  Pass Midnight Champagne by 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 I found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites. If a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore 
 Just like a big chunk of us right now, I'm quite the sudoku addict. I just can't put those little puzzles down! So, I have to tell you first, if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet, you are really missing out! Get your hands on some!  Naturally, I was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles. But what a disappointment! One small board, several people straining to see it, everyone racing to fill in the puzzle...it just doesn't work.  The way they designed this game was to have a board, which is the puzzle to be solved, and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players. Everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle, and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner, assuming the puzzle is solved correctly.  First of all, if you have more than 2 people playing, the players aren't all going to be able to see the board well. Some people are going to have the board upside-down trying to solve it. That's rough! Talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s! Plus, everyone's hands are in the way while they're laying their tiles, which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle.  Next, inevitably in the games I've played someone lays a tile wrong. Then the whole game is thrown off. The instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly, then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct. Most likely, if one person has made an error, that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person's tiles will also be placed wrong, and not necessarily by fault of either of the players. It could have been anyone who started the chain reaction.  The format just doesn't work for this game. My advice is to pass on this particular game. Perhaps a game where people were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle, but with their own puzzle, would work better 
 I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself 
 I allowed myself to be seduced by this juicer's unique good looks and vendor propaganda regarding its sturdy cast-iron construction.  Well, I juiced exactly _3_ 3-inch diameter oranges.  On the 4th orange, a critical cast-iron piece on one of the 2 right-hand hinges broke.  Other review comments concerning difficulty of cleanup are accurate.  I would add that the metal strainer has edges that seemed quite sharp, making cleanup potentially dangerous.  I would not recommend this juicer under any circumstances 
 This is the first time I have been truly disappointed in something I have gotten through Amazon, much smaller than it looks in picture, if it was five dollars it would be too much, too late now to do anything for Christmas,just not worth it at all............ 
 Much of the information about why aid fails is in fact close to the mark.  What is said of the failure of kleptocracies in Africa is true.  However, it is somewhat irrespinsible that the perspective on this failure solely blames Africans.  As a graduate student studying all of these issues, it is apparent to me that the author doesn't make the connection between the current state of Africa and its past.  Africa is failing today because the slave trade turned African kings and mercenaries into forces that ravaged the interior, turning group against group in wars to sell prisoners to the white man.  Colonization left African nations with extractive economies, no infrastructure, no experience at ruling, and behind a hundred years in political development.  And today most African economies are still completely subject to Western markets and decisions about them. Finally, IMF Bank Structural Adjustment Programs and social austerity programs are largely to blame for enriching kleoptocratic despots, fueling wars, and spending billion on white elephant projects. Also to blame are foreign investment groups and governments who backed dictators and armies useful to their foreign policy.  Yet all of this is ignored.  Caldersi is a good read for understanding corruption, kleptocracy, waste, and hoarding...however, it is one piece of the puzzle and ultimately fails to educate the reader on the whole picture.  I recommend this book, but only in conjunction with a wider reading selection that covers the rest of the picture 
 Of the many books and periodical articles that I have read concerning the Spanish Inquisition, this is the most biased and speculative and opinionated.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely long and tedious. We realize that the Inquisition was shameful. However, this work substitutes one prejudice for another 
 I would like to thank all of you here for alerting me (us) to the fact that these episodes are not in their original state and not in order. I love B&B, however, the more I love something the more I INSIST it is an original. Will pass until a release with integrity comes along 
 One of the problems with metafiction is that once you realise you're reading a novel featuring the clever gimmickry of characters meeting their authors and so on, it all becomes very predictable and you can soon see the  next "surprise" coming. This book not only lacks imagination, it  has no class at all: Roth is bawdy without being stylish and the whole  thing just descends into vulgarity and self-impressed cleverness. The  anti-Zionist aspects of it are interesting but not enough to neutralise the  book's other problems. Which is a pity 
 This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.   1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy  2. Door Stop  3. Play Street Hockey  4. Stress Release Stomping Toy  5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift  6. Modern Art for Coffee Table  7. Nerf Ball Target Practice  8. Condom Dispenser   Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!   PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it. 
 I agree with all of you who enjoyed the older television shows on Nick. To add a couple of more...I always liked watching "Salute Your Shorts" and "Hey Dude". Those of you who are in your early twenties (and maybe older) can certainly appreciate these shows as they are our generation's classics. I too wish they would put these on DVD instead of the new Nick shows.   And don't let the immature little children who posted bother you. It is probably just some middle schooler with absolutely no life who posted the terribly mispelled comments 
 I thought this would be a referance book on electronic daytrading software and how to apply the information gleaned from it. The main point of the first 100 pages was to tell the different places I might find the information I expected to have been in the book. Then there are over 200  pages of appendices listing the different stock exchanges, a list of  compainies on the Nasdaq, etc. This would not have been worth the price if  it had been a five dollar paperback 
 I really hope people will read the real Koran and not this politically correct white wash!   The real Koran is FILLED with threats, cursings, and just plain hatred towards disbelievers (= non muslims).  In fact, that is a majority of Koranic contents!   The  Surahs of violent threats and curses (against disbelievers) are written out in every chapter of the Koran.  Repeatedly!! Any fair minded reader would conclude that the Koran is a book of hatred towards Jews, Christians, or non muslims in general.  The Koran TEACHES people to kill non muslims.  That is not hatred??   How can this 'dummy' book ignore all that??  I am usually a fan of 'Dummies' book.  But unfortunately this is not an accurate overview of the Koran. 
 This book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990.  It has a folksy tone and some technical information.  Unless you are buying your church's sound system at a second hand store, this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today.  For example: "CD recorders are under development".  
  How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender?  The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S.  An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position.  Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work?  The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways.  
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 Before you get your hopes about the intellectual adventure Sokal & Bricmont have pretended to engage in, you should know what constitutes "scholarship" to these showmen by digging into their prior work a little.  Sokal, of course, wrote an article with many silly assertions, which he attributed, falsely, to French philosophers like Jacques Derrida (hence the "hoax") -- and he later tried to claim, with a straight face, that this pure fiction somehow "exposes" writers like Jacques Derrida.  His fans find this method of argument and analysis to be perfectly rigorous and logical.  Most real scholars who don't traffic in fictionalized hoaxes disagree.  Later, Sokal was forced to admit that he can't actually demonstrate anything wrong with any of Derrida's arguments.  It is fitting that Sokal chose Jean Bricmont, of all people, to co-author this book.  He needed somebody with a history of stretching the truth.  In his essay, "Postmodernism and its Problems with Science," Bricmont pretends to "argue" against the philosopher Gilles Deleuze with the following strategy: Deleuze at some point had made a historical reference to Hegel, and Bricmont writes:  "Of course, the reference to Hegel itself is amusing. Throughout his 'Greater Logic' [a work of Hegel's], one finds quite nonsensical remarks about limits, derivatives, and mathematics in general."  The logic is clear: anybody referring to Hegel in any discussion of mathematics is necessarily making a "nonsensical remark" because Hegel himself (according to Bricmont) has been known to make nonsensical remarks about mathematics.   Bricmont goes on to say that "the English translation [of Deleuze's book] inadvertently" mis-transcribes the mathematical formula he had originally written, an "error that thoroughly mangles the logic of the argument." In other words, Deleuze has written nonsense because his English translators had written nonsense.  But it gets even better.  In the very next sentence, Bricmont brings up the philosopher Michel Foucault to demonstrate the foolishness of that writer's work as well:  "And, in a comment on two previous books by Deleuze alone, where similar confusions about mathematics can be found, Michel Foucault wrote: 'I must speak about two books that are great among the great ones: _Difference and Repetition_ and _Logique du sens_ . . . But, maybe, some day, the century will be Deleuzian.'  Thus ends a major section of Bricmont's article. Bricmont has asserted that Foucault is clearly a charlatan because he approves of the "confusions about mathematics" that can reportedly be found in two *other* books by Deleuze, books which neither Sokal nor Bricmont have ever discussed. You might wonder why they never discuss Deleuze's well-known _Difference and Repetition_ to demonstrate the mathematical confusion that permeates the book. The answer: Because there is not a single mathematical formula or discussion of mathematics in _Difference and Repetition_. (And I am almost positive there is no such material in _Logique du sens_ either, but I haven't read that one in a while and don't have a copy.)  The reason Bricmont produced this lie is obvious: With Sokal, he is always desperate to draw the "big names" into his ring to give the impression he has "proven" something about them. But he can't do his normal operation of cutting and pasting some random excerpt -- carefully eliding all explanatory context -- because he knows too many people have read Foucault and will easily be able to call him out if he performs that maneuver. So he creates a ridiculous ad hominem argument by pointing to Foucault's praise of a couple of Deleuze's *other* books. And yet he knows that this is not good enough.  He knows it doesn't mean a thing if Foucault praises a couple of books that neither Sokal nor Bricmont can find anything wrong with; So he caves into that common undergraduate temptation to simply make up a lie to forge the necessary link: He invents the "fact" that these other books treat mathematical subjects, hoping to God that nobody in his audience has ever read those books -- just as he himself has never read them.  This is the Sokal affair in a nutshell. Aside from the "cut and paste" theater that makes no logical argument of any kind, it is entirely a matter of "scientists" making up stories about authors they have never read.  Let us remind ourselves about the only "positive" operation that Sokal and Bricmont have performed throughout this entire debate: That is, the operation of their "cut and paste" routine that supposedly demonstrates the meaninglessness of all these "prominent French intellectuals." Let us apply this operation to a random writer who penned the following statement:  "The elementary proposition consists of names. Since we cannot give the number of names with different meanings, we cannot give the composition of the elementary proposition. Our fundamental principle is that every question which can be decided at all by logic can be decided off-hand."  This excerpt -- which any man in the street will tell you is just as nonsensical as any of the excerpts Sokal cuts and pastes from other authors -- was written by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the _Tracticus Logico-Philosophicus_. According to the Sokal/Dawkins argument, this proves that the _Tracticus_ it complete and total nonsense, and that anybody who claims Wittgenstein writes anything more than meaningless gibberish is simply lying.  It is astonishing to me how quickly the ability to think logically falls away from ideologues like Sokal and Bricmont. It is understandable, however, if you recall that their project all along in this "affair" was to arrive at "truths" that they had already determined before they ever began their "investigations" -- truths about a whole range of authors they continually name, but have never actually read.  It seems fairly obvious to me who exactly are the charlatans and snake-oil salesmen in this entire "affair. 
 This book is garbage!  Don't waste your money on the lies sold in this book.  If you want to read fantasy?  I suggest the Lord of the Rings.  The makers of this book and the movies should be ashamed of themselves for profiting off so many lies masqueraded as truths 
 The book is not as good as it's title suggests.  It's made of a kind of recycled paper of recycled paper (yeah, twice recycled).  It looks old and poor.  The content is also very poor,  two pictures,  and no more than 200 words to describe each chair.  I expected more.  I'm still looking for a nice designed, well presented, well manufactured book about bauhaus design,  with worth of information to read. Don't waste your money.  
 I ordered this item one month ago and still haven't recived JACK!!!! 
 I purchased this coffeemaker for my boyfriend. When I opened the box you could tell that the item had already been removed. When I took the coffeemaker out, to my surprise, there were still grounds in the filter area. Needless to say I was disappointed that I received a "used" coffeemaker. I promptly returned the coffeemaker and purchased another at a local store 
 As a rule, I like the Seche products.  This polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  I wasted my money on this one 
 Marjorie Kelly stands heads above her comrades in shouting the old adage "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs" from the father of wealth discrimination, Karl Marx.  She pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it.  Her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism.  She is clearly in left field. The fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today.  Corporations are abiding to compliant ethics (established by meddling government bureaucrats) and no more.  Free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them.  Ms. Kelly and those who like this book should reread Animal Farm, visit the Von Mises website or check economic books by Carson, Hazlitt or Sennholz 
 As an experienced EAI architect, I felt very disappointed at this book. The book aim either at high-level managers to give them an introduction of what EAI is or at students who don't know anything about EAI. It is full of lot of abstract concepts without any implementation plan or idea. Most of tech described are out of date.  I think a good book talking about EAI at least should have a chapter to compare all possible integration ways and should give readers their pros and cons. Also a good should talk about EAI vendors, such as IBM, Vitria, WebMethod, etc. What they really did, how they did, what we should concern today. Of course, a case study is necessary.  If you, an experienced EAI developer or architect, would like to know or get more details about how to do it, you don't need this book. 
 We were  really looking forward to having some Omaha Steaks again. Unfortunately, every steak had grissle and was very tuff. The flavor was not what we remebered either, they were very bland. I could have gotten a better steak at the supermarket and saved myself alot of money 
 Mars and Venus Together Forever is one of the most ridiculous, stupid books that I have ever had the gross misfortune to read.  I probably should have expected what I got, considering that Mars and Venus on a Date left me cold, but I read this one anyway because the original Mars and Venus book had SOME interesting insights and I'm a sucker for a cheap book.  Anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by John Gray must be barmy.  He exaggerates, overemphasises and blusters his way through the 200+ pages - probably with the best motives in his mind - but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid.  According to him men and women are still ruled by `ancient' traditions which dictate that women are all do-gooder types who only desire to stay at home, chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen, grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse, a beer in one hand and the TV remote in the other.  I don't see how anyone, man or woman, could read this book without being annoyed.  For women, the book is terribly unempowering.  If you don't fit in with any of Gray's ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine.  I don't want to read a book which tells me that when I am at work I am moving towards my masculine side because being goal-oriented, competitive and efficient are male traits.  It's all phooey!  For men, the book is also offensive.  John Gray says that men shouldn't express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him.  No, I don't believe that men and women are the same in all respects - there are gender differences - but in Mars and Venus these are distorted.  Overall this book is not worth your time.  Underneath the waffle there may be some good points, but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes.  JoAnn 
 Call a wrecker, this one's a LEMON!! My best friend's high school band sounded better than this menagerie of musicians! Ben and Ric's unique voices blended harmoniously with music like we had never heard before, creating a prototype for many new vehicles, that rode the "New Wave", from the late 70's into the 80's. Classic cars are at their most value when they are all original. You can't build a car in 2006, and call it a '57 Chevy now, can you? This one needs to be driven into oblivion!   My sincerest condolences to the family, friends, and bandmates, of Benjamin Orr. 
 I am a big fan of Thomas Newman. This is just too much the same on every track, unless you like the Balkan dirge(s) for variety 
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 	The title and cover description of this book are  very misleading.  It contains very little practical advice for dealing with "mean girls" who abuse you.  It is mostly about preventing YOURSELF from being a "mean girl", even in response to the real mean girls.  In fact, the author admonishes us not to even defend or protect ourselves.  As the director of Luke 17:3 Ministries for adult children of controlling or abusive birth-families (please visit our website), I take issue with much of what the author says.  Referring to Scripture, she states she "couldn't find commands or even recommendations that would suggest you need to stand up for yourself in order to protect yourself", a concept that we clearly debunk on our site, which gives many examples of scriptures about rebuking and standing up against evil.    	She "can't find" these Scriptures because she manipulates the Scriptures she chooses to use to make her point.  I have no trouble finding quite a few of them (One of them is Luke 17:3, which our ministry is named for). I was amazed to read her take on Matthew 18:15-17, in which Jesus tells us "If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you.  If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.  But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.  If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector."(NIV)  	The version of the Bible she chooses to use in her book is the New American Standard (NASB) (disavowed by its own author- see *** below), in which the above scripture omits the words AGAINST YOU, and merely says, "If your brother sins...."  	Incredibly, she then goes on to try and discredit almost every other version of the Bible that does not conform to her ideas.  She states, "If your Bible translation says "sins against you", the "against you" was more than likely not part of the original text but was translated that way to get across the idea that someone can sin against God by doing something to you."  What?  "More than likely not part of the original text?" Is it or isn't it? What kind of scholar on the original text is she? Where is she getting this stuff from?    	I checked The King James Version (KJV), New International Version (NIV), New Living Translation (NLT), the Open Bible, and the New King James Version (NKJV) and they all include the words "against you" or "against thee."  I also checked two Bibles I have which are over 100 years old. One was published in 1900 by the American Bible Society, and the other was published by the International Bible Agency and William Collins in London and Glasgow and has an inscription from 1894.  Both state they are " translated out of the original tongues; and with the former translations diligently compared and revised."  And they both include the words " trespass against thee" in Matthew 18:15.  	The King James version was originally published in 1611, and yet the author chooses to use the NASB, which was published in 1971, and claim that it is more accurately translated than all the other Bibles, including those which predate it.  How she knows what kinds of "ideas" the translators were "trying to get across", especially hundreds of years ago, is beyond me.  It seems that she is the one who takes liberties with the Scriptures to get across her own ideas.        ***Concerning the NASB which the author uses, one of its own creators has disavowed it.  In New Age Bible Versions by G. A. Riplinger (author recommendation page preceding table of contents), Dr. Frank Logsdon, the co-founder of the NASB, is quoted:  "I must under God renounce every attachment to the New American Standard Version.  I'm afraid I'm in trouble with the Lord....it's frighteningly wrong; and what am I going to do about it?.....the deletions are absolutely frightening.....there are so many.....Are we so naive that we do not suspect Satanic deception in all of this?....(You) can say the Authorized Version (KJV) is absolutely correct.  100% correct!" (from Strongman's His Name II by Drs. Jerry & Carol Robeson)  	Another eye-popper, guaranteed to offend all of us "brainless gals" is the author's explanation of the difference in styles of communication between men and women. "Men usually communicate like a football game.....they always have a goal in mind."  "Women, on the other hand, usually communicate like a game of Twister.......the goal for women often isn't anything more than just speaking- most of the time, we don't have a point......we don't need to figure anything out;  we just need to dump and then we are all better."    	Wait, it gets better. "If you are used to guy talk, hanging out with women might be a little challenging to you.  It was for me.  Gab, gab, gab (in italics!).  But remember, with girls, you can interrupt, change the subject, and make comments.  It's girlese.  Watch how they talk and start to notice their need to just blab." OMGosh! Welcome back to 1953!  This is not coming from a bunch of good ol-boys- it's a WOMAN blatantly and unflatteringly stereotyping other women!        I have no clue as to what, if any, qualifications this author has, but these are just a few examples of the bizarre and outrageous assumptions and statements you will find in this book.  	If you enjoy the rush of your blood pressure going through the roof, buy this book.  But if you are looking for real, constructive help in protecting yourself from the "meanies" in your life, this is not the book for you.  I highly recommend "Boundaries" by Cloud & Townsend for a Christian guide to protecting yourself from abusive people.    	 	 
 I found this book vacuous and jejune.  And frankly, I met the author (without knowing who he was) and he tried to pick me up, and I've never heard such a pile of cr.. in my life.  And I'm not even close to beautiful.  So good luck with his advise 
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 This book is horrible.  It is not true to the original classic stories!  Most of the endings, of the stories I've read so far, are different. I don't care for the illustrations either.  I was very dissapointed.  I bought this for my neices, and didn't read the book until they came to visit me, and by then it was too late to return this book. It's basically going in the trash 
 I too was suckered into this waste of words by David Sedaris, a man I cherish as my own flesh and blood.  Though I will try not to hold it against him in the future, I could barely get through the first story.  Upon attempting the second and finding yet another pathetic, despondent woman, I closed the book never to be reopened.  Dull, vapid, and melancholy.  Snooze 
 The Professional's Book of Koi is little more than a beginner's book with inferior photography.  Anyone who has cared for koi for more than a few weeks will very little that is not available in dozens of other beginners books.  That this might be a book useful for even the serious amateur is laughable.  It was a waste of my money and anyone else's foolish enough to purchase it 
 First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back.  I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it.  The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive.  The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.  Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings 
 The sheer arrogance of van Tharp is enough to put me off. The tone of this book and the advice and insight he gives beggars belief. Van Tharp in no way understands the reality of trading, which after horse racing is probably the hardest profession of all. After reading this book I am absolutely sure that if he does try trading he will fail miserably.  Trading is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for most people. It is not a profession for everyone, otherwise everyone would be millionaires. Nor is it a profession to be taken likely, which most people are lead to indirectly believe when they read this book.  My view is that this book tells people what they want to hear, not what they NEED to hear, and I suppose for that reason alone it will sell 
 I just threw this book away.  Not even worth trying to re-sell. Wish there were negative stars for ratings ....   I got this book when we decided to give IVF a try and maybe my mistake was getting this book after 1 1/2 years of infertility treatments.  The information in the book was very dated.  Reading through the author's experiences was extremely traumatic for me, but after spending a day upset over 'how bad' the book made the IVF process seem, I realized that a large part of the author's bad experiences came from her having doctors who might have been the best medical doctors ever but who had little compassion for their patients.  And then reading through her incessant whining about how much she hated needles .... Infertility is a medical condition, but no one was forcing her to take shots nor was her life riding on that medicine (unlike many people who have to take shots of life-saving medicines every day).    Even her bluntness was annoying sometimes.  Her "sorry, but that's the way it is" writing style might truly reflect her experiences, but my 2 years of infertility treatment experiences have not been like that.  There are many different types of infertility treatments and many different styles of REs/doctors.  You do not have to put up with competent but uncompassionate medical care.    
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 This is not a satire of Candide, it's not a slice of pop culture. It's a dirty old man's idea of what sex should be like. A dirty old virgin man.   It's boring. The writing is atrocious. It has several rapes and incest scenes in it. It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc). If you want a book indicitive of the culture of the time, or just plain full of sex, please look elsewhere 
 Another collector of wishy washy grab table records, who obviously bought anything as long it was cheap and had some nipples on the cover, proudly presents his collection. This was probably cheap to reproduce for the publisher, since none of the shown record sleeves were of any lasting value for the market and probably scratched from memory after release. The artwork shown is superficial and mostly shows images that could have been cut out of page 3 of nameless 3rd class girlie magazines. The music must have been secondary indeed, I have been dealing with music for 30 years and never met people who actually listened to this type of entertainment. On the 70's and 80's it runs even shorter than on the cheesecake tradition (gack...this word alone...) rest, not even classics like Hendrix' electric ladyland are included here...bare anything that was a little more specific or explicit. A complete waste if time - I wish someone would get a serious collector to produce such a book.. 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 This book is a concatenation of rather second rate conference papers covering the unbelievably hackneyed topic of Freud's oft-reported death. Honestly, what next - "killing Elvis"? If you enjoy books about the continual burying of Freud then read Crews or Masson - much better written. Wrong, but better written....of course much of what Freud wrote WAS bunk. Even psychoanalysts agree about that. But gosh, give him a break! He was the first one on the scene and his work has been revised by succesive generations of analysts (Winnicott, Klein, Bion etc). Perhaps the author might next try and do what Freud did; produce a model of the mind that explained psychopathology, many aspects of existential phenomena and creat a language of the mind that entered the every day lexicon. While Freud might be dead, his ideas (ego, projection, identification, libido etc, etc) most certainly are NOT 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 not good at all!!!! while watching the movie i thought it sounded like a great soundtrack... but i think they must have put all the bad songs on i 
 OK- the 1st time I heard of Gaitskill was when I saw Secretary & that was based on her story in "Bad Behavior". "Bad Behavior" I thought was mediocre, but had some potential. This book I found terribly dull. The characters are cliched abuse cases & the situations are predictable. The one story from where the title is taken is about a 16 yr old runaway who baby sits for a mother who never comes home that night. Then that's it. The conversations are not insightful, in fact there's really not much to say about them at all. I felt this was a very lazy book. For a better read, I recommend Emily Carter's "Glory Goes and Gets Some." While not all the stories are great, many are very good & the books have similar tropes- with Carter's dealing with someone with HIV/drugs & Gaitskill's with sex & whatever else. Yet Carter's is far superior because her descriptions are much more insightful & the characters more developed. Just goes to show you how it's not the subject matter, but the way something is written that makes it work 
 Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
 1st you can't see any of the tattoos, the photos are blurry and the descriptions of the tattoos are either incomplete, wrong or just not there.  It was more like a copy of The National Inquirer on what the stars like to eat for breakfast.  It had nothing to do with tattoos or what they mean.  I was really dissapointed and wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
 We waited too long to try this out after it came.  We would return it if it wasn't so late.  It takes forever to warm up and forever to cook!  Then the waffle is not hot!  Not happy at all with it 
 I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused.  The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through 
 I picked up a copy of the first edition originally published in 1977 years ago at a used bookstore, mainly for some of the wonderful drawings.  While I can generally recommend that original edition this book has gone downhill over the years in my view. The original drawings were warm and natural, the newer one's have a harder, colder edge to them.  The most decadent the original edition got was in describing pot and poppers...now we've got info on crystal meth, cocaine and other hard, life-destroying drugs.  Far from being an objective reference book on gay sex this book has always had a pretty obvious agenda...namely selling the promiscuous casual-sex lifestyle the authors saw as liberating.  This lifestyle isn't limited to gay men of course but it was rather new and enticing for our long oppressed group when the book was first published.   Entries on long term partners or couples is brief and halfhearted but entries on watersports, rimming, fisting, etc. are extensive.  From the authors writing style one would gather that anyone not into these esoteric practices just isn't opening themselves up to their true desires.  The real problem however, is that instead of having a nice, long entry on a topic like anal sex, covering both it's history and all the issues, Joy is more interested in cramming in every weird, esoteric "gay" practice that it can in order to be called definitive.  Whether waxing rhapsodic in a new entry like 'shaving' or belittling the promising trend toward a lighter-skinned physical ideal for us caucasions rather than an overly sun-leathered look the book too often rubs me the wrong way with it's (overstated) opinions.    The best gay sex manual ever written was published by Gay Sunshine Press the same year as the original Joy of Gay Sex (1977) and is also still in print.  It is Men Loving Men by Mitch Walker (revised in 1985 and 1994).  It has beautiful illustrations (especially the hippie influenced original) and a joyous, loving, holistic writing style.  Gay Sex by Jack Hart (revised in 1998) is also very good and again, with wonderfully sexy drawings.  These other books deal with casual sex as well but they don't sell it with the relentlessly aggressive manner that this book does.  If you find many of the practices detailed in this book variously unappealing or scary at least you can rest assured that there are wonderful other books out there that don't feel the need to detail every bizarre practice under the sun 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 I didn't know there was a "Parental Advisory" on this cartridge until it arrived. Clearly not suitable for children. Also, I didn't know any of the songs on the cartridge. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the songs included before purchasing 
 This book is full of errors, and it made me wonder where in the world this  author got so many misconceptions about C. Evidently, he either has not  read the book by Kernighan and Ritchie (the originators of C), or has not  understood it, yet. If you want to become a serious programmer in C,  consult the 2000 reviews at ACCU (Association for C and C++ Users) Internet  site. If you just want to impress your friend at your first date, make sure  your date does not know C better than this author, because this book is  just as bad as so many C/C++ books in the market 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 This otherwise excellent account of George W. Bush's appalling environmental record (strategically?) ignores, and thereby condones, the President's three most deadly anti-environment policies: never-ending mass immigration, nearly open borders, and countless stealth attempts to reengineer more amnesties. These policies are fueling a US population explosion that is outstripping that of many Third World nations.  Bush and Pope (and his Sierra Club) are something like the dazed South Asian islanders seen wading out into the sudden eerie low tide, oblivious to that high distant foaming crest, a tsunami, making its way, making its way.  
 If you want a pretty view of cobain read this.  I think I've read 4 bio's on Kurt.  This book makes him normal, just a guy with some pain and an alienation problems, so he does lots of drugs and kills himself.  How romantic.  A more realistic read is Christopher Sandfords Kurt Cobain.  It ain't pretty but it reads honest 
 Specifically, you'd have thought that Russell and Corrine Calloway would've learned from what happened to them in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 (chronicled in "Brightness Falls").  Nah...they're still the shallow, selfish, self-absorbed people they were 14 years before.  The trouble is, you can't really tell whether McInerney thinks that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 David Von Drehle had it right, the Triangle Fire is one of the great American tragedies and a great story. But Drehle takes an almost scientific approach to a story about people. Padding out the book to make it novel length (The appendix is nearly 1/3 of the page length) he so often repeats himself and circles back on the same information, over and over and over again.  Detail in such a tale is good, but Drehle is so caught up with just how many sewing machines are on each table he loses sight of WHY this story is so compelling.  The actual story of the fire is retold no less than nine times from nine different perspectives. And any time the book advances Drehle yanks it back to circle back on itself. Drehle might be a good archivist but he's a poor novelist.   I grew up on tales of the Triangle fire as my great grandfather was one of the men who went up to the roof to escape the fire and his stories were always rivetting...Drehle's aren't. DO NOT Recommend this book. It's a huge disappointment! 
 Though the recipies in this book sound delicious this book is far from written for dummies as it claims. Being a beginning cook I find it hard to follow what would seem to be the basic instruction for each recipe. I get lost figuring out just how to cut an onion "coursely" as I've never done it before. There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?) This book is obviously written for someone who has basic knowledge of cooking and its very frustrating to read. The instructions are too vague for beginners and the descriptions of techniques leave me wondering what the author is talking about. Not to mention each recipe expects that you have an entire kitchen full of gadgets at your disposal to prepare these fancy dishes. I think I'm going to have to find a different book to teach me to cook before I can dive into "Cooking for Dummies" and understand whats going on. Look for a different book! 
 I must admit to being an obsessed Delerium fan.  When the first Conjure One album was released, I was reasonable pleased with the direction I felt the artist was headed. Bought the second and was totally disappointed - nothing "magic" in this one!  Didn't even live up to being just another Delerium theme work, fell far short of that AND offered nothing in the line of growth 
 I ordered the combo ink cartridge package. The black cartridge quit working after one page. I emailed the contact person and it took almost a week before he got back to me. They sent a replacement cartridge and it worked the same as the first. I will not buy from them again 
 I was so excited to take the Shark Sweeper home. It worked great until I needed to charge it. The motor never started again. I could not return it because I threw away the box. What a waste of $40 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! 
 It's been a while since I read the first book in this series, and I'd forgotten how distracting the Scottish vocabulary was. Some of it, like "ken,"  I could easily figure out, and could skim through without detracting from the flow of the prose. However, a lot of it just seemed sprinkled in there for no good reason, and made the book seem pretentious. I'd have to stop reading, flip to the back of the book, and look up a word, only to find out that frequently, there was a modern English synonym that would've worked just as well. Don't use "kintra-side" or "speeritie" when "countryside" or "spirited" will do just as well.   Aside from that, I found the switching sisters plot, and as they went through the kirk session, kept thinking, "There's no way they're going to tell him he's got to sleep with the other sister, and even if they did, there's no way he would do it." And yet just a few (2?) months after the alleged love of his life (who he spent months learning to love) leaves, he's all excited about having a baby with her sister and praising her for being a good mom to Ian.   I was really disappointed by how this turned out, and that Leana would stand aside and leave both her husband and her son. I realize that social and religious codes were very different in the time the book's set in, but still, the unbelievability of the characters' actions make it very difficult to think any of the main characters are doing the right thing, or to root for them. I'll probably skim through the 3rd book just to see how it ends, but I'm frustrated with how the 2nd book went. 
 I was very excited to read Dana Spiotta's 'EAT THE DOCUMENT' not only because the premise sounded great but also because of all the praise it had generated.  Unfortunately this novel did not live up to my expectations at all.  The first three fourths of the book was, in my opinion, nothing more than words on a page.  It did not set the stage for the heart of the story nor was it very interesting.  So many times I considered putting the book down never to pick it up again, however, an unfinished book nags at me therefore I was compelled to complete it.  Only the last hundred or so pages, where the focus was more on the main characters Mary Whittaker and Bobby Desoto, made the book at all redeemable.  I would have loved a lot less of the pretentious social commentary and more of an in depth look into SAFE the 70's radical group that Mary and Bobby belonged to as well as a better look into Mary's life not only for the first few years after she went underground but in present day as well.  Although this was not the fast paced thriller about two fugitives separated not only by time but irreparable actions that I thought it was, I am glad that I finished the book because if I hadn't I would have missed the best part of the story.  However, this book takes a lot of patience.  If you are not into the history of the 70's radical movement and how it relates to today, this may not be the book for you. 
 Maybe it's the fault of the internet, a medium seemingly designed to expose the user to the worst possible grammar and spelling. Possibly it's the fact that I speak only English; if I was a speaker of Portuguese, I might have enjoyed this more.  The joke, "Look at this phrase: Isn't it bizarre?" is repeated hundreds of times. Keeping in mind that it wasn't authored to be a humorous book does give one a chuckle, as does the background story, but that means the back cover represents the best of the book.  
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 This book adds nothing really new that has not been covered by Poul Jorgensen's classic book "Salmon Flies - their character, style and dressing" and unlike that book will never become a "classic"  book. The only critiscm that I ever had of Jorgensen's book was that the  illustrations were in black & white and lost some of the detail. Why  "Building Classic Salmon Flies" did the same is a little puzzling  in view of the great advances that have been made in colour printing and  the few colour illustrations that there are in the book are of poor  quality. I learnt absolutely nothing new from this book and in view of Ron  Alcott's reputation I was somewhat disapointed. I would rate this book as a  mildly interesting book for a library on Classic Salmon Flies; but  unnecessary 
 I was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor's office. I love InStyle, Lucky and other shopping mags, but the tone of this is mean and snooty. There are too many ads, and very little content. There's a Q&A section about sex after baby that's just mean, threatening that if you don't jump back in, "one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing..." Way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby. Yuck. 
 This book contains some of the most inaccurate route descriptions in the history of guide books. The milage makes no sense by any known system of measurement. I might go so far as to say this book could get you killed, especially in the Grand Canyon. It's as if the whole thing were written using only lo-resolution maps, with no accounting for topography. I find it hard to believe the author actually took any of these hikes. If anybody does ever see him on a trail, though, kick him square in the nuts for me and my friends who had to suffer for his incompetence 
 This game has a great design and excellent/fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC. Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues. This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly to the commands. The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat. This CAN be a fun game, just don't play the PC version. Borrow someone's Xbox and play that version. This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right 
 This novel dies as it grows. If you love the individualism, heroism and power of James Clavell, get ready for the cynicism, impotence and sadness of Christopher New. The first quarter of the book shows great promise and then spirals into nothingness in its attempt to break the Clavell traditions of absolute good vs absolute evil, all the while moving into the murky waters of moral relativism. I was left feeling empty and cold by this novel. Save your money and time and read something by Clavell, Ayn Rand or Mario Puzo 
 This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System. Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation. Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money 
 I love Westerns, especially John Wayne Westerns.  But, I found this movie to be lacking.  In the movie, they tried to showcase a handsome, young actor (Jorge Rivera) who had no charisma or acting skills. It was so bad that I almost stopped the movie. I kept watching, just to see if it would get better.  The movie is "okay" at best.  Train robberies, cavalry soldiers, bandits.  The best part of this movie is the majestic outdoor scenery.  I guess I could have given it 3 stars instead of 2. But, I just didn't enjoy it all that much.  The plot was loose and the story line was not especially interesting.   It seems that people don't think that this review is helpful, probably because I voiced a negative opinion of the movie. I'm just telling it like it is.  It's an OK movie to watch once.  But, certainly not a classic.  That's why you seldom see or hear much about it.             
 I personally did not find this book too helpful at all.  I do think things happen for a reason and I thought this book would give you some kind of profound reason that you could walk away with and say "oh yeah" I get it now, but I did not get that from this book.  
 I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great 
 If you follow this book, people mey be happy with the person they meet-but it won't be you 
 "Blood Dolls" is a confounding freakfest about which little of worth can be said... It begins with a quite literal indictment of corporate ethics as a pair of unscrupulous complicitors in an unethical business enterprise enter the world of a business "genius" who wears a long-discarded X-Files prop (literally copied from the episode "Grotesque") as a mask, has a morose clown for a butler, and keeps a dwarf around for no apparent reason other than to keep the general sideshow aura amped to an extreme level. This dwarf routinely tortures his encaged, all-female rock band, who, beside being surprisingly technically adept, do little more than provide nudity. Shortly into the proceedings, the cornball bloodletting starts, the billionaire reveals the disproportionately small head beneath the mask, and one of the complicitous nobodies is transformed into a "blood doll." These must be parodies of "Puppet Master," but since that film might as well have been a parody itself, that isn't saying much. The film exudes an air of sadism amid the camp, and occassionally meanders into utterly senseless philosophical musings culled pretty much directly from the sources they cite. The acting is awful; the characters and story, absurd. However, it's also pretty damn funny, in an Ed Wood-let's take this seriously even as it becomes increasingly absurd to-kind of way. Worth a rent for a camp conoisseur, but little else 
 If you do purchase this device make sure you write down the serial number.  Supposedly there's a sticker on the back that has the serial number on it.  My switch failed after a week.  Since there was no serial number on my device the manufacturer has decided not to provide product replacement even though it's their unit and has their name on it 
 If you intend to play this disc on a PS3 DO NOT PURCHASE IT.  It doesn't work on the PS3.  What a rip off 
 I love the pictures. The pictures are great, bright and.....MADONNA! But....the calendar is horrible!!  I am not one to write on my calendars (because I collect them) but, on this you do not have that option because there are no boxes to write in. The dates are written like this..... Monday    01 Tuesday   02 Wednesday 03   etc....  There are no holidays printed on the calendar so, there is nothing to flip to and look and see what day of the week a specific holiday is on. So, I am not too impressed at all.   If you are looking for a calendar based soley on pictures than this is the one for you but you get ZERO information out of the deal 
 An important test of any theory is how much evidence exists for its case.  In this book, Doherty proposes that Christianity began with a celestial Christ who was thought to be crucified in a celestial realm above the earth, and that Paul's letters as they currently stand speak only of a non-terrestrial Christ.  In fact, Doherty makes this claim for all the New Testament epistles, which are thus presented as direct evidence -- people describing their own belief and thus directly attesting to the existence of the belief.  One trouble facing Doherty's thesis is that Paul's letters and the other early Christian documents speak of Christ's flesh and blood, and his birth and death; they also provide other indications of a terrestrial savior.  So a large part of Doherty's book consists of arguments to the effect that all these earthly-sounding words really referred to a "spiritual" death in the heavens.  A great deal of work has already been advanced against these arguments, and it does not need to be repeated here, except to say that no single piece of evidence for Doherty's thesis exists which is not ambiguous.  Doherty hardly denies this ambiguity, since it is his own contention that even the most terrestrial-sounding passages in the New Testament can be dismissed as metaphor rather than plain evidence for a historical Christ.  Thus, the main argument of this book is about a lack of evidence, that is to say, an argument from silence.  Doherty claims that the first ancient Christians are silent about an earthly Christ.  Again, much prior work has been done to show that this is far from true.  What I find interesting is that an argument from silence, though difficult to make and not generally favored by historians, can be legitimate, especially if combined with positive evidence.  In this case, if we could not combine it with such evidence we would face new arguments from silence that contradicted Doherty's thesis: Why are the proposed believers in the celestial Christ silent about so many details of their heavenly savior? And why do we not find ancient Christians, Jews, and pagans reporting or reacting to doctrines about a celestial Christ?  In this book, Doherty deals only with the second of these two questions.  He looks for ancient authors who tell us that others either believed in a celestial Christ or doubted the terrestrial Christ.  Since no ancient author tells us clearly about people who doubted that Christ appeared to be a flesh-and-blood man on the earth, Doherty proposes that we can find hints of such a thing.  In Appendix 3 of this book, he quotes a letter by Ignatius of Antioch to the Magnesians, written at the start of the second century, wherein Ignatius hopes that his readers will attain "full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate" (Magnesians 11:3).  This seems to Doherty like a polemic against a celestial Christ.  The principle he is using is a valid one, akin to when mainstream scholars use Paul's assurances about the Resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 as evidence that doubts about the Resurrection existed.  But in that case, Paul tells us clearly what the doubts were.  Ignatius does not, and it will be worth a little effort here to go into the details.  Ignatius says earlier in his letter that some deny the death of Christ.  Today we call this the Docetic doctrine, which held that Christ merely appeared to be a human being but was actually only a spirit who appeared to die on the cross.  This doctrine is well-attested because so much ancient Christian literature seeks to refute it; and Doherty rightfully regards these refutations as different from the refutation that he is looking for, the proposed polemic against a Christ who did not even appear to walk on the earth.  Yet Ignatius mentions nothing like that.  He alludes to Docetism and to unspecified doctrines denying that Christ was the same as the one true God.  And he refers very specifically to Judaism, just before making his assurance about the birth, death, and resurrection in the time of Pilate's governorship of Judea.  He is telling his readers, in short, to have full assurance about things that both Docetism and Judaism are known to have challenged: the nature of this or any proposed savior's birth; his Passion under the Roman leadership in a Jewish province; and his Resurrection.  Doherty thinks that Ignatius is asking his readers to be "fully persuaded" of the bare facts of these things - the bare fact that they took place - but it hardly seems probable that Ignatius would be content to ask for that.  He is asking his readers to attain "full assurance" about all of the Church's interpretations and teachings concerning these things - to keep from straying into any kind of doctrinal dispute.  So he writes throughout his letter.  The ambiguity of Doherty's evidence prompts him to argue that there is so little clear evidence because orthodox Christianity changed, destroyed or neglected the evidence that was once there.  He uses this argument openly in a chapter claiming that at least some second-century Christians worshipped only God and rejected all savior figures.  Doherty presents the writings of Minucius Felix as a "smoking gun" to that effect, but he allows that the evidence is not as clear as we might want.  He tells us that it is the best evidence that can be expected, because clearer statements would never have "reached us through 2000 years of Christian censorship" (see p. 292).  That is the conspiracy theory.  Considering that Christianity has not wiped away all evidence of doctrines that it regarded as heresies, but instead has offered refutations of every heresy and preserved these refutations as a guide to the true faith, Doherty's claim is hard to believe.  A conspiracy to hide the truth can take place, Christians not excepted; the record of the past can be doctored, and has been.  But Doherty's specific claim is that Christianity's very first doctrines contained a purely celestial Christ, and that these doctrines have not been preserved even as heresy (with Ignatius serving as a brief and ambiguous exception).  Christianity's true origin was wiped away, not with refutation and doctoring, but with silence.  It is hard to believe that Christian institutions and individual writers were silent about what would have been the most radical and provocative of all the heresies -- silent about an idea that, per Doherty's central thesis about how religions work, would have threatened the Church's power to a greater degree than any of the other heresies, some of which were already regarded by Church Fathers as mortally dangerous to the Church.    So Doherty proposes one additional reason to explain the silence: he suggests that the Roman war against Palestine in the year 70 C.E. uprooted or destroyed so many lives that later writers could claim that Christ had lived there in recent decades, without challenges from locals who remembered either the true situation or the beliefs of the sect that worshipped a non-terrestrial Christ (see pages 168 and 179).  Doherty's picture is of a dying sect.  But a fundamental claim of Doherty's idea is the pervasiveness in the entire ancient world of the belief in saviors who descended to celestial regions above the earth and experienced pain or death there.  Had this sort of belief really been ubiquitous throughout the Empire, and applied to Christ as far as the church in Rome (to whom Paul addresses his longest letter), one war in Judea could not have extinguished the belief; and even in Judea it would be likely to reappear. Ignatius himself, per Doherty, is proof that the belief survived the war.  But if Doherty is right, we would expect such a popular doctrine to have flourished after the war.  We'd expect the orthodox sects of the Church proclaiming an earthly savior to produce some refutations.  The Fathers established in Rome, the center of all ideas, would surely have encountered or heard of the celestial Christ, for Doherty does not address how the celestial Christ of Paul's Letter to the Romans was just forgotten -- except by returning to the idea of censorship.  I invite any reader attracted by this book to work out Doherty's scenario and to test it repeatedly against the available information about the time period.  That's an external test.  Then test it against its own premises, repeatedly, for an internal test.  It is a worthy and rewarding challenge 
 Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.   There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.   There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.   Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs.  What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting.  Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post.  If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly.  I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me.  When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters.  I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality."  Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters.  This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  PROS:  Can be used for film or digital cameras  Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting   CONS:  Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance 
 This book was entertaining, but... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of "inappropriate elimination" (peeing/pooping in the wrong place), even though the author himself describes it as "the number one behavior problem".  He says "No other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia".  I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic???  The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).  Throughout the book, I wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions 
 Agree w/ a prior reviewer - this book was VERY disappointing.  I was horrified to hear it read, for the first time, by a 'teacher' (who obligingly filled in the dialogue for the non-mouse animals, to say to the mouse: "No I don't want to be your friend. . .  your too little (or whatever)."   I think it can be read w/ a more positive spin, e.g., "I'd love to be your friend, but I can't play right now. . . "  But the illustrations really convey a negative message to kids, and on its face is about being friends w/ your own kind, since it's only the mouse at the end who says "Yes."  Not what I want to teach to my children.  This book apparently was written in the 70's.  It's way out of date, and I wouldn't buy it.  Other Carle books have the same type of animal illustrations, so it's nothing special in that regard either.  
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 it probably would appeal to a lot of people but was not of interest to me.  i gave it a go and then felt that it was all too familiar with an uninteresting and not too imaginative slant.  
 Was very disappointed with this book.  Not only did it cover only the most touristy places, but it left out many more interesting, not as common, sites.  The real tip off is that he lists places that "guarantee the price listed here if you show them your copy of this book" or offer a "10% discount" with this book.  That isn't really objective reporting in my opinion 
 I have never seen so many sentances that just end, with nothing continued on the next page, so many typos, so much stuff left out. This is the worst game guide I have ever read through !!  Altho, I must say fable is an awesome game, and its worth it just to have the reference for the creatures and the weapons 
 After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 This book is not the quality of work that I've come to expect from Janette Oke.  I was very disappointed in it, and quit reading it about half way through.  The characters were lovable and interesting, but I thought the plot dragged just a bit too much for me 
 He starts off talking about secret societies, with some interesting but dubious ideas.  Then he goes into conspiracy theories trying to link Rockefellers and Rothchilds to everything.  This takes many pages of useless backstory to set up.  But by far the worst part of the book is the rant made about alien establishment of humanity.  I get the feeling most reviewers didn't finish the book or didn't notice it slipping from historical analysis and links to secret socitietes to the recitation of the Alien-Earth Theory, with no links made at all.  It is bizarre beyond belief, and the assurances of 'scientists' and 'experts' in this section makes it clear the other sections are most likely made up as well 
  This text is not rigorous, nor does it take a cookbook approach.  Little is derived or well justified.  This reference will not help you think critically about the underlying methodology.  The only reason to use this book is if you want a fluffy, example based approach to regression.  Expect to be frustrated.  For someone with an appropriate background in linear algebra, I would recommend Davidson and MacKinnon's "Econometric Theory and Methods," which is a much more satisfying approach to regression 
 Feminist icon Angela Davis goes way out of her depth by claiming that the American women's suffrage movement itself was racist. The evidence she cites has no currency with historians of women's suffrage or of 19th century America. Her analysis of the current women's movement rests on much stronger ground. 
 The Maverick guide to Bermuda didn't meet the high expectations set by other reviews here. There isn't a whole lot to the book, it isn't full of secret suggestions as others suggested.  Instead there is much on the obvious basics and little beyond. Our family did enjoy the chapter discussing some of the colorful history of Bermuda, but otherwise I regret the purchase.  I suspect one of the other guidebooks would have been a better choice. I do recommend Bermuda 
 Being a period movie afficionado, I had great hopes for this movie.  However, I regret to say...do not waste your money.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has been excellent in other movies I have seen, but his acting in this is so overblown and forced it is painful to watch, and I am not using this wording frivolously.  There were actually a couple of points during the movie where the acting was so pathetic I could not look at the screen...much like pretending to not notice when someone slips on the ice, just to save you both from the embarrassment.  Rhys-Meyers' good looks did nothing to take my attention from his terrible performance.  Gretchen Mol's performance was a cardboard cutout version of her character, with a plastic smile plastered over her face during most of the movie.  Madeline Stowe's performance was acceptable as Rhys-Meyers' mother, but not up to her usual standards.  Jennifer Tilly gave her Aunt Fannie character a valiant try, but she is terribly miscast and could not seem to find it within herself to even produce tears during any of her apoplectic fits.    I am SO disappointed in this movie.  Luckily, I rented it before buying it on Amazon and am thankful to have only lost the rental fee instead of purchasing it to sit unwatched on my DVD shelf until it turned to dust.  It may have made a decent drink coaster, however...  
 Simply a big dissappointment. Could perhaps be considered a good introduction to the media for an absolute beginner, but lacks depth for any serious practitioner. Too American for my taste as well. Avoid 
 "The Book of J" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the Pentateuch. Bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of Solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. The next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of J by Rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. The following two sections include Bloom's commentary on the book of J, its narrative, personalities and themes. This is the silliest book on the Hebrew Bible that I have ever read. It is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the Hebrew text. Bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that I agree with. He mocks religious Jews, Christians, the "abominable Jeremiah" (176) and, with particular frequency, J's God. To the unprejudiced reader the God of the Hebrew Bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what Bloom describes. The arrogant claim that the Hebrew Bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that Bloom provides. Among other things, we learn that God sits in the terebrinths of Mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of Genesis 18), that God loves David but not Moses (41) (contrary to Exodus 33:11-12 and Numbers 12:7), that Moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to Genesis 17), and that God doesn't punish Moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. However, we are told that traditional Jewish and Christian expositors are "weak readers" (34) and "mad" (246). Virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about Noth, von Rad and Van Seters, among a few others. To his credit, Bloom mentions the opening words of Cassuto's commentary on Genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with Cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. I recommend Cassuto's "The Documentary Hypothesis" as the perfect antidote to "The Book of J". Not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of Bloom's assertions. Other literature of the ancient Near East receives no treatment. The content of the Pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium BCE, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the Near East of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. For the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the Hebrew Bible generally, I recommend Kitchen's monumental "On the Reliability of the Old Testament". Bloom and Rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form "v'yhi" (329). Rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but I think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better. Readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible should look elsewhere. In my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. I do not recommend it 
 If character means loving the rich and big business, then Bush has character in spades; of course, indifference to the middle class and disdain for the poor are also part of the Bush thing 
 This hair dryer was purchased as a Christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years.  I could not locate one locally so I order from Amazon. The dryer only worked for a few days.  Nothing I do will make it work again.  The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much. 
 In my opinion, the three worst books in history are "Something Wicked This Way Comes", "Lord of the Flies", and "Of Mice and Men", in that precise order. The movie is okay, but I detest the book itself. The author writes in such a queer style that I barely understand the whole thing. The movie isn't my favorite, but at least it makes sense.   The author uses way too much symbolism, so to speak, and I can barely get a picture in my head as I'm reading. Not only that, but the characters use terrible language, and I am the kind of person that has zero tolerance for vulgarity. So take my advice: watch the movie, stay away from the book. 
 Naturally, I was quite excited when I first heard that a new book about Hekate had been published. While there is plenty of material from academic publishers, there's really a great need for a book aimed at the Pagan audience. The book I would like to see would be written by someone with a good grasp of the primary sources and some familiarity with ancient Greek religion, and would contain suggestions for how to honor Hekate both in a traditional manner, and within the context of Wicca and other neo-Pagan religions. Let's just say that "Crossroads" ain't it.  First off, the author has not done his homework. He accuses "conventional" scholars of ignoring or misrepresenting Hekate, but the only name he mentions is Edith Hamilton. Apparently he is not familiar with the wealth of information printed in books and academic journals from the 19th century onwards, which is inexcusable since much of it is still in print, reprinted or even available online. Robert von Rudloff and Sarah Iles Johnston are listed in the bibliography, but Crowfoot has only bothered to read "Hekate Soteira", which has a rather narrow focus, while leaving out "Restless Dead" which would have been better suited to his purpose. He quotes Krauss, but only as Krauss is quoted by Iles Johnston.  As for the primary sources, Crowfoot draws much from the Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (which he mistakenly attributes to Homer). The problem is that he fails to put things in their proper context. While he often gets the basic facts right his interpretation is just as often wrong, because he lacks knowledge of ancient Greek religion and culture. For instance, Crowfoot is obviously not aware that myth and cult don't always agree. He also doesn't deal well with seemingly conflicting stories, such as those dealing with Hekate's different genealogies. Instead of realizing that different myths can illuminate different aspects of a deity's nature he attempts to create a nice, neat, picture which is just not impressive in a book that claims to be a "ground-breaking" work.  The bibliography is a joke. Crowfoot appears to work under the assumption that all sources are created equal, and as a result much of the information in "Crossroads" is taken from web pages credited to "Unknown"...  In conclusion, "Crossroads" is not historically accurate, does not present any revelations, and the claim that it should offer a correct interpretation of Hekate is outright laughable.  
 I found "Barrio Boy" to be very boring, as a matter of fact I didn't even try to finish the book.  So save your money and buy something better 
 This movie is a Shakespeare play. The dialog is impossible to understand for MUCH of this movie. Anyone who says that they understand everything these actors are saying must be lying. No one speaks this way now and it is very hard to follow. I wish I had known that it was Shakespeare before I bought it, but for some reason I didn't. The movie is also like a play but in a movie format. This might not be to everyone's liking. Just be cautious of all these rave reviews. People here claiming this review as not helpful are the ones pretending like they understand every word of a Shakespeare play. I would just like to continuously pause the dvd and ask them what the actors just said and let them fumble over themselves trying to explain 
 I started reading this immediately after the last REH compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. While REH was first and foremost a story teller, Pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous Alcibiades. This, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. But why do this? Why use such a crappy method of story telling? I guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. All in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story. So crappy that I felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews.  I want my money back

 This book is strong on background material and demonstrating why children are teased.  "Mom They're Teasing Me" is chocked full of examples of children (usually with poor social skills) being teased.   However, this book is weak on the issue most concerning anyone who would buy it.  Specifically, the author does not offer advice on what to do if your child is being teased.  Most of this book comes down to the following statement:  children with poor social skills are teased.  The authors's solution:  read the book, "Helping the Child Who Doesn't Fit In."  Personally, I think the author's premise is overly simplistic, but that other book does appear to be worth trying.    The bottom line is, when you've read this entire book, won't have an answer to "Mom, They're Teasing Me. 
 You guessed it.  I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book.  I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do.  Sorry 
 Not goo 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 I don't particularily appreciate athlete autobiographies, especially those written by figure skaters and gymnasts. They lack depth, inside information, insight, and good writing.  Sasha Cohen's autobiography is no exception. It is a good book if you're a fan of her, especially if you want pictures (although there aren't too many of them in here). The thing that irritates me the most is how fluffy most of these types of autobiographies are. Sasha's autobiography is a piece of fluff. There is no information on what the real world of figure skating is like or anything along those lines. It just gives you her basic story, how she got started in skating, et cetera. The writing style seems pretty upbeat and happy, and I find it hard to believe that she wrote this all by herself (ghost writer, anyone?)  I also think it's a little too early in her career for an autobiography (I think this was published before her silver medal win at the '06 Olympics). But, anyway, if you want a basic little autobiography of the U.S.'s latest figure skating Olympina, you may want to check this one out. Otherwise, skip it- it's nothing too special 
 Since Mr. Suarez is no longer a police officer since being convicted and sentenced to prison for insurance fraud, what he has to say should be taken with a healthy grain of salt. Much, if not all of what he includes in his books and seminars is rehashed material liberally "borrowed" from other established instructors and trainers, and while being investigated for his crimes it was duly noted that at least half of his "street-shootings" involved stray dogs, not armed and dangerous felons.  Bottom line: A person with such a track record can hardly be considered suitable for obtaining such important information from. Yes, Mr. Suarez has served his time and is once again a free man, but I for one do not consort nor do business with known felons. The information in ANY of his "literature" can be found elsewhere, usually from whence he obtained the information to begin with, and most of the times written far better and of course from a reputable source 
 No a very good video.  Poor quality.  Hard to follow.  Very much a cheat copy of the movie Gettysburg.  
 This coffeemaker is a huge disappointment!  The stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works, when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere, and if you do not use additional paper filters, you get coffee grains.  In summary, a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee.  The plus? the water filter, but that is it 
 Thick towels but shed, even after washing. Don't wash with anything else but other towels. Seem to have good color saturation. Nothing special, but better than most discount store brands. I'd probably pay a little more for better quality next time 
 I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.  
 I took the Security+ exam and passed the first time.  For a study guide, I used the All in One for Security+.   The guide is inadequate in that in completely omits some popular test subjects while going into too much detail on other items.  If I depended on this one source solely, I probably would not have passed.  Thank God I had the Sybex CISSP book to help me through!  In retrospect, I can understand the recommendation to use many sources because you might be missing important test topics if you don't.  When taking the exam, the questions I had trouble with were ones that were nowhere to be found in any of the study materials I used.  Even if I had memorized the entire "All in One" book, or had it in my lap when taking the exam, it would not have helped me on some of the questions.   In sum, if you depend on the "All in One" for Security+, it is likely you will have a hard time passing even if you memorize the book cover to cover.  My advice - use another source or many other sources.  Good Luck 
 John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.  It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men 
 Unusually for me, I was suckered in by the author blurbs on the front.  This book is very difficult to read.  All the thoughts are fragmented...dialogue, internal character thoughts, action, everything.  It jumps around, never giving enough information to figure out what's really going on in a particular scene.  If the prose was better, this book would be ok.  The ideas aren't all that bad, it's just a friggin' slog to extract them from the weird prose.  Too much work.  Also, it is often unclear which character is speaking, which I suppose is another problem with the prose.  And then there's the POV...it keeps jumping from character to character.  I actually haven't finished the book...I'm on page 146...but I don't think I will, because I'm really struggling.  And I have utterly no clue where the rave reviews on the cover came from.  It's a very clunky and obscure book.  Which is a pity, because if the author cleaned up their prose, it might have been a good book 
 I like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature: the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature.    Ok, so I have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside/outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more.  Many mornings I check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read, for example, 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees.  It will be 60 degrees inside.   My window is double-paned, but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings.    When not window-mounted and placed by other thermometers, the readings are acceptable and consistent 
 I have been trading professionally for over 10 years.  I have done very well in the markets after a long learning curve.  The ideas in this book have a slight chance to work, but you'd be better off fliping a coin than  using his entry methods.  I was on the floor and everyone knows about these  ideas. Everything in here needs a tight stop 
 I really wanted to love this fragrance...after all, it is quite expensive and I'd read rave reviews on many websites...but after one spritz I sold it to a friend of mine! My favorite perfumes are Beyond Paradise, Ralph Lauren Romance, Ralph Lauren Style, and DKNY Be Delicious. Light Blue, to me, smells overwhelmingly of musk. I wore it all day and I ended up feeling nauseous, with a bad headache. This must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me 
 I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire.  
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 I was so excited to get Nav/DVD in our new SUV.  However, I hate this unit!  You can't watch DVDs unless the car is in park.  The whole point was for me to watch movies in the passenger seat while my husband drove.   Also, you have to put in a Navigation CD everytime you want to look for a new address.  This means you have to remove your DVD or music CD and put in this special disc.  You then have to be in park to put your DVD back in and start it again (we have screens on the headrests). The worst part is you can't use any features of the Nav system while you are driving!  I have to pull over to enter an address or find a point of interest.  While my husband drove, I figured I'd be able to use these functions.   It is not user friendly.  We have read the manual and still cannot accomplish tasks such as programming the radio stations! I regret this purchase immensely.  I do not recommend this system to anyone unless you are willing to put the car in park ever time you want to use any of its functions 
 As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 If you are looking for a book that provides a brief overview, you will be satisfied with Eric Rosebrock's book.  If you are looking for a "how to" reference book that covers MySQL and PHP in depth, you will probably be disappointed.  The book merely provides basic information as the title states: "Setting Up LAMP: Getting Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP Working Together" that being LAMP installation and configuration procedures on a FEDORA Linux environment. This book offers the necessary information to install FEDORA Linux, and getting your Apache web server operating with MySQL and PHP.  Rosebrock's book does save you the time and effort of having to glean information from those various "open source computer geeks" (right brain) web sites.    
 This movie is cliche-ridden from start to finish. A young man from the shipyards gets into Annapolis at the last minute, is miserably ill-prepared, overcomes all obstacles, and pulls off a feat no plebe could ever hope to accomplish. All the stock characters are here--cold father; abusive commander; sympathetic, pretty junior officer; the guy who doesn't make it; the guy who tries to commit suicide when he fails; the bad plebe turned good guy. Plus, you see every twist and turn of the plot coming from a mile away. I thought it was a waste of time 
 I read the 2 reviews on amazon and since I did like her single, Me and Emily, I thought I would really enjoy  the cd.  Well I didn't.  Bought it this morning, heard it once, put it on ebay.  Not one I would care to listen to over and over.  But everyone is different.  I personally was hoping that her album reflected "me and Emily" which reminds me so much of the melody of Marc Cohn's "walking in memphis."     I would recommend anyone who is interested in this album to listen to it first if possible and come up with your own conclusions.  But let me state for the record, "Me and Emily" is not a reflection of the musical style of the whole album.  That is the only song in that genre 
 I am very disappointed in this book.   From the Introduction: "Common names for plants can be misleading and do not always distinguish among the species. Additionally a plant known by a common name in one region may have another common name elsewhere, leading to further confusion. However, common names have been retained because they are generally of more interest." Then the book presents the plant alphabetically by common name. Of course this presumes that I even *know* common names for plants I know by botanical nomenclature.  Clearly I was wearing botany blinders when I read the description, saw, "an essential guide for botanists" and thought it might be a good addition to my library. It should be called "Eating the Plants of the Sierra" because it is all about the ethno botany, hardly bothering to offer more than a few one-line descriptions of a "key characteristic" to help you realize that out of a particular group of related plants, some are edible, some are not.   It's ironic that Amazon is pairing this book with Weedon's "Sierra Nevada Flora" because while "Wild Plants" acknowledges that "various keys are adapted from several sources, including ...Weedon." What the book does NOT report is that there are direct remarks in "Wild Plants" that are almost identical to remarks made by Weedon; about Snowplant (Sarcodes sanguinea): Weedon says, "Stalks edible when cooked like asparagus; however this plant is rare and protected by law."; "Wild Plants" says: This fleshy plant is edible when prepared like asparagus. However, this is a protected and rare plant..." adding that you should only eat one in a emergency! I'm still trying to imagine being stuck in a bad situation with only my stove, a steamer and some hollandaise!  IF your primary interest is in learning about native uses of plants, this might be a better book that I realize. Aside from just about everything seeming to be a cure for toothaches or some sort of bleeding, I also learned this "Interesting fact: Small-flowered collinsia was used to make a horse run fast and was used externally for sore flesh." So I guess if you are on a slow horse, bleeding, and happen to ride by some small-flowered collinsia (and recognize it), you are going to be in luck.  Ready to snack on something from the carrot family? Cautiously go through the ways to prepare delicious Lomatium ("Caution: SOME species were too resinous to enjoy") but stop short of reading about Poison Hemlock (described but not illustrated) which is described as "a painless way to die!"  The book actually mentions that some plants are rare, then goes on to suggest that if you want to try eating them you should do so with moderation. "If you decide to harvest plants, it is important to harvest them with wisdom and respect."  Bottom line: this book, with misspelled plant names (a few found so far), minimal identification information, and that odd common-name thing, is not worth $40 unless you are a pharmacist.  
 Juana La Loca and her obsessive love for her husband Price Phillip is one of history's more fascinating chapters. Juana apparently refused to be separated from her husband's dead body. She was eventually imprisoned as mad, although it's unclear whether she was simply extremely passionate (...), somewhat neurotic, or actually truly mentally ill. Director Vincente Aranda opts for the first theory. Juana (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) is tremulous and doe-eyed -- when she meets her fiance Prince Philip (Daniele Lioti) the two are so overcome with passion they demand to be married on the spot. Philip then carries Juana off to the bedroom, and from then on (according to the movie) Juana is a slave to her rakish husband. She wants to have sex constantly. Of course Philip's a jerk, and loses interest, and Juana goes mad. There is really only one way to make a kind of movie like this, and that's as an unabashedly enjoyable bodice ripper. The dvd headliners seem to play up this aspect: "Sex so hot the ladies in waiting eavesdrop!" Unfortunately, Aranda is actually quite prudish. He seems to think that this movie is really an impassioned feminist film about how passionate women are punished. Perhaps for this reason, we never actually see Juana and Philip have sex. Thus, Juana's sexual obsession is less palpable for the viewer. The movie also pays some lip service to the political machinations surrounding Juana. Ultimatley, Mad Love loses steam. Part of the problem is the casting of Lioti -- he looks like Fabio, but really cant act. And Philip is such a murkily written character -- is he simply a cad? A Machiavellian monarch? Like many historical dramas the movie is shot in long, uninterrupted takes and a rather still camera. It is never sunny, and no one ever smiles it seems. It's not bad for a film to play fast and loose with history. Juana la Loca's story is ambiguous enough that it can afford some modern revisionism. But for a film that wants to be a bodice ripper, a compelling costume drama, and a feminist statement, ultimately the movie ends up being none of these things. A disappointment 
 I purchased this book with the intent on using it in my AP Literature class.  What a waste of $50.00!! 
 As a former fundamenatlist christian and now an atheist studying philosophy in University and being forced to read this book as mandatory reading for my course I'm stunned that this man is taken seriously. Apart from the moral questionability of where he is teaching (the Military Academy) any man who believes in the doctrines of Mormonism has a completely skewed view of life and morality in my opinion. I know that this isn't the right place to discuss said doctrines so I won't elaborate 
 I wish I would've read the last review before ordering this product.  This is a STUDY GUIDE, which usually comes FREE WITH purchase of the $... TEXT BOOK in book stores.  Don't be mislead by thinking you're getting a great deal on a text book.  It's not the real thing 
 If you're into tea-cup-size coffee cups, then this is a 3-cupper. If not, it's close to useless, as it is for me. 
 I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly 
 It took me about 3 days to figure out the little box with the tiny book IS the book I bought! I thought it's a nice gift came with the item I payed... I guess I'm a Dummy!  I don't understand why so many folks wrote comments under this item while the comments are indeed for another product:-( 
 I've been following DBB for a few years now. I bought this album after admiring the other live album "ROWDY DOWDY" (which was incredible). But unfortunately "RELEASE THE GREASE" fails to convey the band's tremendous energy onstage. The sound quality is not the best (as is often an issues with live albums) and die-hard fans of Jen's renditions of the earlier songs may be disappointed - this album lacks some of the earlier albums' funky grit. If you want to hear DBB live - SEE A SHOW!!! - or purchase "ROWDY DOWDY"... but pass on this album 
 We did not have all the mounting screws-- hardware in the delivered box.I had to call the manufacture who responded right away and mailed us missing parts but they were not correct and complete.Very frustrating!!!!! 
 I am not too thrilled with this cookbook.  Many of the ingredients are not items that you would have readily available in your cabinets or refrigerator.  Also, it seems like the preparation and cooking of these recipes would definitely take more than 15 minutes 
 I know, I know - Elaine Stritch is a "legend" - she makes sure you know it, believe me...  Maybe I'm the only one in the universe who felt like smacking her, but, I felt like smacking her.  She offers a few bon mots about Old Hollywood and Broadway, however the rest seems like a self-congratulatory vanity piece.  I got the feeling that she's been practicing these "naked" little soliloquies for her audience of one, in front of the mirror, for years. Maybe that is the point of the show, I don't know.  Perhaps some think she should be humored because she's 80, but crikey, I just found most of it insufferable.  Sorry Elaine.. 
 I consider myself an extreme newbie when it comes to Flash, so after reading most of the reviews for "The Flash MX Bible" I decided to shell out the cash. God what a mistake that was.  The only pro the book has, is it's size. Yes is does contain a lot of information, but the manner it presents it, is the biggest problem. It's boring, dry, unimaginative stuff. Not something you'd expect when dealing with a program that has a firm foundation in art, and creativity.  The thing reads similar to my Lightwave 6.5/7.0 college text book only with a worse format.  So if you're an intermediate, or professional flash user this is might be what you're looking for, but if you're an amatuer or total beginner don't touch this book unless you want bore yourself away from Flash MX before you even get your feet wet 
 We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders.  However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working.  It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center.  They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  I only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  Panasonic did not honor our warranty 
 This one's easy.  The lies start showing up even in the book description.  "The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories."  Actually the Zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially Israel, but the surrounding Arab nations attackeed immediately.  After the 1967 war, Israel offered virtually all the so-called West Bank, but without East Jerusalem, back to Jordan.  They offered Gaza back to Egypt.  They did not offer the Golan Heights back to Syria, because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for Syria's artillery.  Israel's offer of the West Bank and Gaza back to Jordan and Egypt was offered at a price: recognition, peace and negotiation.  At the 1967 Arab summit in Kartoum, the Arabs responded to Israel's offer with No, No and No.  Israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war, but under pressure from the U.S. and elsewhere, Israel did not.  After the war, in 1967, there was no talk of a Palestinian state in the territories.  For 19 years Jordan occupied the West Bank, and there was no Arab or Palestinian clamor for a Palestinian state.  For 19 years Egypt occupied Gaza, and there was similar silence.  There was no reason for Israel to talk about yet another Arab state when even the Arabs hadn't talked about it.  The whole idea of a Palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding Arab nations to make war against Israel by a new method: public relations.  If they could make the world believe that Israel was an occupier of lands not theirs, they hoped world opinion could defeat Israel where Arab armies could not.  Nevertheless, in 1973 the Arab nations tried yet again, but were trounced, and the war by public relations started to ramp up.  In my opinion, Neuman's solution, "The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.", shows real impoverishment of thought.  For almost 60 years the Middle East's Arab and Muslim nations have been trying, unsuccessfully, to destroy a nation that was recognized by the United Nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners, but it is Israel which must surrender?  At the time of Israel's creation, Arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee (at the request of the attacking Arab nations) were to be given full political rights, unlike, for example, Jordan (Transjordan at the time), in which Jews were not allowed to live.  In fact, although there is racism on the part of individuals in Israel, Israel itself is not a racist state.  It is the surrounding Muslim and Arab nations who are the racists.  In my opinion, Neumann's book, even if you consider only its Book Description, is trash in the spirit of the anti-Semitc Czarist forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
 Sweet Charity is a thinly veiled cover-up for the many middle and upper class people benefitting from the "hunger" scandal wherein billions of dollars that could and should be spent on poor people are  instead wasted on staff, buildings, refrigerators and trucks -- the whole  food bank and soup kitchen nine yards. When added to for-profit  agribusiness interests whose garbage is dumped into this system for tax  deductions and at taxpayers' expense, the "food"  element of the  larger poverty industry makes sense. This book won't tell you that the food  banks and soup kitchens often receive legal "kickbacks" via  tax-deducted charitable "grants" from the likes of Procter and  Gambol and other giant corporations. If you want the real scoop on another  of agribusiness' dirty secrets, read something else. If you don't mind  getting hoodwinked, go shopping 
 if you've been a fan of zorn's stuff for a while now, and have had this creeping feeling as of late that he seems to be releasing everything but recordings of his own farts, this record isn't going to do anything to boost your confidence.  another release that talks about how highly artistic it is, yet seems to have very little soul.  very little that makes you want to come back for more.  what's on here is interesting - and sometimes quite good - but honestly there aren't many 'sparks' to be found here.  in ten years nobody's going to list this as a zorn classic, that's for sure.  i love zorn, and really like some of the far out stuff he's done in the past - be it in the realm of jazz, ambient, chamber, etc. but i'm starting to get the feeling that he's creating albums to fulfill some type of experimental checklist in his mind rather than follow his musical intuition.  and in the process he's recently put out more than his share of "interesting but not captivating" albums.  here's another one.  i'm becoming very skeptical of tzadik releases as a result, which is unfortunate.  this is of cursory interest by zorn standards, heavy metal standards, experimental standards, and so on.  you're much better off exploring his better works - there are a lot of them 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 ... I was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1... and of course i did buy it right a way.... then i was shocked when i started to read it.... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools Reference guide.... and actually a lot, lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well, i lost my money.. 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 i practically fell asleep while watching this tape, the girl doing the exercises isn't even saying anything while she's doing it. It's a voice over! also she's all alone in a blank room. All the exercises are basically the same. I would suggest Mtv Pilates. It's a lot more fun 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 I find it very difficult to appreciate this book.  While I'm very interested in the subject matter and thought much of the mathematics was interesting, I found the author's wholesale plugging of his ideologies unpleasant, insulting and out-of-place.  I am simply not used to reading a math book (popular or otherwise) filled with vitriol for the UN, Socialism, Communism, the Romans, environmentalists or any of the other pet peeves the author seems to have.  Mathematics is a subject of pure reasoning.  I find the author's constant ideological interjections distracting and a worrying sign of his rigidity of thinking.  I'd recommend one pass over this book and keep moving along.. 
 This BINGO game is truly awful.  There are four different versions of the game - Colors/Shapes; Numbers; Animals; Addition/Subtraction.  Each version has its own spinner that you drop in the base unit.  The cardboard to which the spinners are attached was warped from the get go making it impossible to get true spins. And the spinner can't stop on all spots because of the warped cardboard.  The animal card/spinner was broken out of the box.  All in all, this is a cheap toy, unworthy of the LeapFrog name.  Go for a traditional bingo game 
 This one's a pass. Starts with some blah-blah-blah about warrior mystique with quotes obviously approved by the public affairs department. Follows with mostly sterile description of battles in the manner of "this division went up the mountain, got repulsed, regrouped and then destroyed the enemy. Then this other division..." These battles are supposed to be stirring but all we get here is a mind-numbing list of names, events and dates 
 Dr Weil is a quack and making a lot of money off some very misleading information.  If you want to waste your money, you can buy this book.  It makes non-evidenced based medical claims as if they were fact and plays on  the readers ignorance and desire for a simple cure-all.  I work in the  medical field and am always shocked by the amount of misinformation that is  published.  Save your money and don't buy this book 
 This book is wonderful for the wing chun student who already knows what he's doing and needs no instruction. For anyone else this book is a mess. several times in the book the author seems to jump to ideas that are misplaced with the original idea. Moreover the book does not do a good job of explaining certain aspects of what you're even doing. For a student who is trying to gain insight into wing chun this book is a thumbs down 
 J. L. Carr's A Month In The Country (1980), which is set in the 1920s, is the story of Tom Birkin, a budding restorer who accepts a job uncovering a church mural in a small Yorkshire village, a village predictably populated by greenhorns, cranks, and eccentrics of all stripes and colors. What is immediately apparent is that the novel is not a product of the earlier era in which it is set, nor is it an attempt to recreate the style of the period.   Though Carr attempts high British humor in the grand 20th century tradition of P. G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Stevie Smith, Denton Welch, and Muriel Spark, much of what is supposed to be funny throughout the novel is in fact only obvious, smug, and not nearly as intelligent or crisp as Carr apparently believes it to be. Thus, when Birkin's employer warns him about a scythe that hangs in the outdoor privy, Birkin speculates whether "it was the loss of life or only manhood he was concerned about," and most of the attempted humor continues at about this level.   A Month In The Country might have been saved by a compelling plot or theme, or simply a collection of perceptive insights uniquely expressed, but none of these elements are present, and so what little story there is merely plods cutely along. Whether is it is Carr himself, or merely Tom Birkin, who is so self-satisfied is difficult to say; either way, the combination of the anemic first person narrative and the idiosyncratic attempts at humor, in which the author indulges himself at every turn, sink the book quickly.  
 I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral.  There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for.  However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read 
 This book demonstrates exactly what's wrong with attempts to make subjective evaluations about "how one should live one's life" sound scientific.  This book is dominated by the author's rhetorical ideological claims about what really makes the good life, which are then "supported" through his own studies.  He fails to acknowledge the MANY caveats that should be placed on any such superficial studies of human activities.  His knowledge of religion may seem profound to those who've never studied it -- but to anyone who's done any religious studies in college it should be clear he doesn't have the slightest clue.  A horrid, awful abuse of "science" to support his own philosophy of life.  If you want a self help book, then find one where the author at least ADMITS that he/she is giving you their own, subjective ideas.  They'll likely be far more genuine 
 The prof at my college chose this book as a textbook for a OS course. That is a mistake. This book is too dry. The content is dated. It is simply NOT readable. I don't know why so many people give it good rating. Go figure..... 
 I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.   The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes. 
 The author wants to fish out the contents of recent suspicions of the role and `function' manifestations of Judas.  Their observations may sound alien and dissimilar to many media discussions that have been going on in North America, and became more energetic during Easter. I feel they brushed the whole debate aside.  The momentum given to the arguments whether there was a `conspiracy' between Jesus and Judas is the works of the media - the newspapers, radios, and the TV - based on analysis allegedly emanating from ancient Coptic manuscripts (third or fourth century) - named Gospel of Judas. Analyzing, chemically, the ink of the manuscript remains controversial to me.  Was such action heretical?  I do not know but I believe this will lead to nowhere.  By rushing the information, which the National Geographic Society in Washington has uncovered, the media is trying to confuse our minds, like saying `there are more beautiful photographs of women than there are photographs of beautiful women'.  The American novelist James Cooper - has written, "" If the newspapers (media) are useful in overthrowing tyrants, it is only to establish a tyranny of their own"". Cooper pronounced those words in the mid 1800's when there was abundant news but little resources of intelligence to verify. Stunt news was then predominant.  And still is. Anything that attracts attention, a public figure, whatever he did, is news. Our century cannot be different from prior centuries when it comes to people trying to find proves and rationales for certain recorded actions and reactions that have taken place in previous times. The quest for discovering new venues will never stop as long as the progress in chemistry and technology continues on such quick pace. The point, though, is how the media is transmitting this data, and when.  For example: during the rule of the Bourbons in France, French gatherings in the royal court were very much similar to `sï¿½ances' where learned individuals, for instance, persons of high ranking families (mainly ladies), tried to rationalize the spiritualistic messages delivered by the distinguished Bishops, and Cardinals who had been appointed by the Pope. Such debates had notably been conducted in the short lull periods of peace times, when Europeans were not fighting each other and the material were printed by mass communication available during that era, but with restricted distribution. In their space of relaxation, rich and well fed and triumphant individuals tended towards exaggeration, so they extended their conversations to philosophize subjects such as `it's impossible to believe there is a God', or those who wished to demonstrate the degree of their `learning capabilities', so to speak, talked of how sceptical they were about the existence of God but never professed true atheism.  Some agnostics were doubtful and noncommittal about the whole subject of religion and wanted to be showy about their `enormous knowledge' and their `abilities' to discover new subjects for discussion. Some even equated such sï¿½ances with Freemasonry. Still, printed material on these meetings remained restricted. Renowned individuals like Verdi, Brahms, Tchaicovsky, Talleyrain, and Robespierre were famous agnostics.  Interestingly, in their lives they were peculiar kind of men, of no fixed occupation, vagabonds (but many of their works, whether good or bad, will remain ageless) and in their eloquent mother language parlance, they pretended to have acquired the luxury of `discovering' better, bright and distinct ideas with a supernatural attributes to even doubt the existence of God. And the media ran after them, propagated their views, and unearthed their personal memoirs and their mysterious and private exchange of intimated correspondence, much to the chagrin of the Church. Nowadays, the term `Conspiracy Theory' is having the greatest ascendancy. Like agnosticism, and scepticism in the old days.  The media is treating `Conspiracy Theorists' like window-dressing articles of a new fashion, a means of improving appearance and giving artificial and false impression. The media, to a group of conspirators, attributes any `action with a bang' to sinister design they have all performed together such as acts prohibited by law, or by means against the law.  But because human imagination is infinite, some media fat cats are going back in history to touch base with our Religion (Christianity)- and this book is not an exception and its related movie.  They are giving us the mental image of events that we always believed and perceived as real, as not anymore acceptable to the senses unless verified.  Think of it guys. Isn't it strange that on Easter Sunday this year (2006) there have been more media talks about Judas than Christ?  As far as I am concerned, these persons are loquacious, and very forceful in their trivial discussions that one might be led to pursue their pattern of offensive and garrulous thesis, supported by deft cameras and skilful writers. Many buy their books, which are becoming `best sellers', amid the sad division of our Church, and would agree with them on face value.   What a farce! 
 After seening and reviewing Fahrenhyte 9/11, I chanced upon this film and watched it.  It is deceiving and insubstantial.  As the #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, including most of the important books about national security, 9/11, oil, and terrorism, I have to state there are exactly TWO points of truth in this shallow stupid little film:   1) the photo of Bush reading a book upside down was a fabrication, Bush was actually listening.  2) Clinton blew it.  Correct. Madeline Albright will go down in history for refusing to let her staff report terrorism honestly, and Tony Lake will go down in history for failing to get it right.  It bears mention that then Commandant of the Marine Corps Al Gray did get it right, in his article "Global Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's" published in the fall of 1988, but no one wanted to listen.  I am impressed by the teacher of color who was in charge of the classroom that day, recounting how she felt Bush was truly presidential, and wise not to add to the panic by rushing out of the room.  Absolutely.  Good point.  The rest of this extreme rightist propaganda tract is totally disconnected from reality and the truth.  The movie claims that Gore lost because of Nader, and completely ignores the hard documented proof that the Florida leeadership acted to disenfranchise over 35,000 people of color, one reason that the Bush family was so confident, in advance, of victory in  Florida.  This trashy film fails to address the many angry Representatives and the inert Senate, including Gore, who failed to use the power of Congress to redress the impeachable wrong done to America in 2000 (and again, this time in Ohio, in 2004).  Anything that features snap-shots of Ann Coulter is very likely to be loosely related to the truth, reality, or the public interest.  I am glad I watched this film, because it reconfirms my gravest fears--the extreme right in America now has a propaganda machine more powerful that Hitler's, and a brainwashed following more lethal than the Hilter Youth.  This is seriously troubing stuff.  I gave Moore four stars, one star down for being too glib by half.  That's an honest assessment.  This shallow little movie gets two stars, and both of those are for reflecting what is in the small minds of the nutty right 
 I'm not really sure what Schine was trying to accomplish in this novel. Alice is now up and moving, and chasing birds for that matter. I couldn't quite appreciate the absurdity factor in either novel. My recommendation is  to read Rameau's Niece for a good read and The Love Letter for fun 
 A voracious reader, I seldom write reviews because one) time is too precious; two) sheer laziness; and three) ratings on reviews have more to do with whether you liked the book someone else liked, or did not like the book someone else did not like.  In short, it is not what you write but whether the reader agrees with your selection of "stars."  In the case of "Nothing But Victory," I had to get up off my lazy but and say something about my disappointment with this book.  I have read two of Woodworth's other titles.  "Jefferson Davis and His Generals" would rank among my favourite ACW titles, and it is based on Woodworth's thesis work at Rice University.  "Six Armies in Tennessee" is a fairly good piece of work, given the limitations of the series in which it belongs (which seems to put a limitation upon endnotes and supporting citations).  In "Nothing But Victory," Woodworth has written something that stands less as history, with all its warts and blemishes, and rather comes across as a piece of propaganda for Grant and the Army of the Tennessee.  In Woodworth's hands, Grant becomes the Union hero, par excellence, and the Army of the Tennessee, his chosen instrument with which to smite the Rebels and put done secession.  Woodworth frequently overstates his case, minimizes the faults of Grant and the AOT, and just plain out ignores contrary views that might smudge the image of either in this execrable piece of pseudo-history.  In order to support my opinion, I turn to Woodworth's use of supporting evidence, or the lack thereof.  In "Jefferson Davis and His Generals," Woodworth has an endnote section which runs around sixty pages for some three hundred odd pages of text.  In "Nothing But Victory," a six hundred page tome, Woodworth's endnotes cover some eighty pages (and the font of the two books is of different sizes, the Davis title being the smaller).  In his endnotes, Woodworth will support his views sometimes on the strength of one source.  And guess which source that might be: Grant's "Memoirs."  Let us take a look at the Battle of Shiloh and the question of the role of Don Carlos Buell and the Army of the Ohio: did it save the day for Grant?  On page 199, Woodworth writes that "Grant and Sherman, however, were as completely surprised as it was possible for generals to be.  They had had, in Grant's words the day before the battle, `scarely the faintest idead of an attack (general one) being made upon us."  In chapters nine and ten, the coverage of the Army of the Ohio is minimized to a few comments, and its overall role in the battle is never addressed, leaving the unstated conclusion that the Army of the Tennessee won the battle by its own efforts.  Granted, the book's primary focus is on the AOT, but this emphasis should not get in the way of a more accurate and balanced approach.  During the first day's fighting, a number of stragglers from the AOT went to the base of the bluffs at Pittsburgh's Landing.  This number can only be estimated.  Grant, in his "Memoirs," put the number at four or five thousand.  Woodworth then writes on page 184, "Later, Buell and others not particularly well disposed toward Grant would brandy about figures as large as 10,000 or even 20,000.  This number is patently absurd, but the former is probably exaggerated as well.  Eyewitnesses who had extensive opportunity to observe the crowd on the bank estimated it as closer to 5,000."  Other than an endnote for Grant's estimation from his "Memoirs," written many years after the fact, Woodworth cites no other source.    In the same paragraph, he concludes by writing, "Several pointed out the fact that the area was not very large and would not have held more than that."  Here, he does have an endnote, and on page 666, we see that "several sources" has become two.  Why exaggerate and describe two as "several"?     The "problem" is not that Woodworth is allowed to hold this views; he is.  The problem is that Woodworth ignores or lightly brushes over views to the contrary, while weakly supporting his own arguments.    For a different view on the role of Buell and the Army of Ohio at Shiloh, one can read Engel's biography of Buell, where pages 235-239 address the question, and at least is willing to examine different views with more care.  With Woodworth, even Sherman is called "the fool" (p. 157) for his lack of preparation at Shiloh, but Grant is the Teflon general, above criticism, along with his army (minus the 4,000-20,000-take your pick-- stragglers).    Further evidence of a slanted approach can be found in chapters twelve and thirteen, which deal with the battles of Iuka and Corinth respectively.  One of the sources upon whom Woodworth depends is Peter Cozzens' "The Darkest Days of the War," a book in which neither of the primary Union commanders, Grant or Rosecrans, come off in a favourable light in Cozzens' view (Cozzens has own problems with the historical facts getting in the way of his writing, but that is a review for another time).  Woodworth conveniently uses the sections criticizing Rosecrans, while ignoring those sections that question Grant's management, or mismanagement, of these battles.  Although Grant's "Memoirs" pepper the endnotes, I do not believe that any of William S. Rosecrans' writings, or those of his biographer, William Lamers, make an appearance to give a differing light on Iuka and Corinth.  More could be cited in support of my view, but life is getting in the way.  In the end, it is all a shame, really, because it is not necessary for Woodworth, or anyone else, to put Grant on a mantle of hero-worship.  Grant was perhaps the greatest Union general of the Civil War (who is going to compete with him other than maybe Sherman?).  What makes Grant great is not that he made mistakes, but that he learned from his errors.  Grant seemed more open about admitting such mistakes during the war, but by the time of the writing of his "Memoirs," his memory appeared to be more selective (once again, like with the comment on Cozzens, this opinion is stated but not supported, and as such, must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt).  Woodworth does not serve the purpose of honouring the Army of the Tennessee, or its greatest commander, Grant, by ignoring historical facts that would provide both a more accurate and more balanced view.  As a history teacher, Woodworth knows better.  I cannot understand why either his conscience, or his editor, allowed this shoddy piece of work to be published.  Grant and the AOT stand great in the history, despite Woodworth's disservice to their memories.  I paid about $1.50 for my copy, plus postage.  Already, Woodworth's book has found its worthy place in the discount section of mediocre writing.  I can only hope that in his next book, he will demonstrate the skill that was apparent in his earlier works. 
 This book is certainly a very traditional and classical coverage of Protestant ecclesiology. It encourages the community-aspect of Protestant Christianity over the tendency towards modern individualism, which sometimes leads to the question of why Church is even necessary, etc. Major reference that most everyone will recognize is German theologian Karl Barth.  This is indeed a call back to the more traditional form of communistic Protestantism, and for this it ought to be applauded. Nevertheless, even this book is far off from original Christianity in all of its glory. Whereas Protestantism was a movement towards more spirituality and less bureaucracy (thus misbalancing Christianity slightly, though Catholicism can be blamed for the exact same thing), this is just seemingly a call towards more bureaucracy and less spirituality. However, it does cover its topic well, and the spirituality aspect of things is not even claimed to be covered, so the author is without fault. Just keep in mind that original apostolic Christianity was the perfect balance of government and spirituality, so as to move towards the salvation of souls; this book does not offer the answer to moving closer to that original Christianity.  And in regards to why I gave this book only two stars: In the spirit of its locally communistic message, it kind of staged an attack on America. Not in the tradition of radical Islamists, mind you, but more in the manner of a dry shrug and indifference towards American sovereignty, and the very concept of financial liberty, etc. One main example I give for this: This book criticizes Ronald Reagan for criticizing certain Churches that had policies or at least preached against nuclear defense, in favor of nuclear disarmament. In doing so, the author indifferently throws out one of the most phenomenal Christian Americans (and a Protestant at that) ever. To focus on such a small detail that may or may not have been negative in Reagan's campaign, while ignoring all of the phenomenally charitable things he did for us all, is selfish and ridiculous.  Moreover, as I have said, this book is indeed polemical, and in a kind of viciously biased way. You will not find both sides in this book expressed very well. What you will find is a simplistic explanation of Gnostic belief, what you will not find is a very decent representation of Reagan's Christianity (which is actually not very traditional in the ecclesiological aspect), or even of the most traditional forms of Christianity (Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism), from which even Philip Lee's form of Protestantism is still a great deviation 
 Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.  It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).  The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.  But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.  This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)  If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.  I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.  I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.   
 I bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that! One day I plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn?t respond. It?s a XP sp2.  I unplugged it and tried again with the same result, the same with the regular pc?s where I usually use this flash drive. Bottom line: money wasted.  Being a regular costumer of sandisk, I must say im very dissapointed. The must frustating thing is that I wont get a refund because the 30 days expired.  Besides, it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one (the 512 micro flash drive). So, try some other product.  
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 The version of this CD that was sent to me was incomplete: it did not contain all the tracks that were on the original recording. It is missing "Driving Home for Christmas" and "Shamrock Diaries". It also came with a different cover than the one shown on Amazon.com. This was most frustrating. I returned the CD and will order another one from a different vendor 
 HAD THIS FOR LESS THAN A MONTH AND IT JUST STOPPED HEATING.....THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND WHEN IT DID HEAT IT WAS NICE.....BUT FOR THE DOZEN TIMES USED IT WAS NOT WORTH BUYING...WILL BE RETURNING IT 
 If you have a choice between this and Pojman, get Pojman. I don't particularly like either of them, but Pojmans "Ethics" is definately the better one.  BAD: The chapter on subjectivism is completely confused - this book has no proper introduction to meta-ethics nor is its place in general ethics explained. The chapter on relativism is ok, but I would say that there are serious mistakes there too. The chapters about utilitarianism are just too simplistic and exclusive.   GOOD: The chapterson the social contract and the chapter on Kant are both good, as is the chapter on feminist ethics. It is good to see that stuff usually left out (social contract, feminist ethics) is included here.  Overall you should get something else for a good introduction to the subject and if you already have some knowledge of the field, this book will be of no interest whatsoever 
 This text is one of the most poorly written I have read on the subject of data structures.  The JAVA overview should be removed since it goes into no real details pertinent to data structures, and uses a grammar to define the language which serves to confuse more than assist in learning.  I suppose they felt they needed to be different from other texts in some way to sell... how about writing a clear readable text with good code examples?   There is apparently no code in the text which is compilable (only code fragment) and obvious errors in some of these code fragments.  The writing and questions are ambiguous and unclear in many places.  I don't see why any university would choose to use this text.  Maybe the publisher is giving kickbacks to the department?!?  You could spend your money more wisely... such as on Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++, and a JAVA text such as Deitel and Deitel as a resource instead.. 
 My daughter was so excited about receiving this for Christmas and it didn't work!  She was so disappointed!  
 I bought this ready to do a lot of things with it. I haven't been able to sew one thing. You have to use it with the laptop at all times or it will complain with an annoying beep again and again. I tried to sew a light material curtain with it the needle poked at the bobbin holder and now I can never use it again. I have to get it repaired because I am unable to find a replacement part for it where I have looked. Offers a lot of options and I am sure once its repaired if ever I will eventually get to sew one thing 
 This novel was required for an English Writing class, and I must say that the novel serves no practical purpose what-so-ever.   By the novels end I was left wondering to what intention the author had in mind, but more-so to what reason did readers have to keep reading?  Life is short and time is valuable, and so I only choose to read novels in which something can be gained. Okay, life is not always fair, yet the show must go on...got it.  But this novel's all-too-obvious moral comes at a painfully high price; one must leave their common sense on page nineteen, only to find the storyline to be too dark, too dramatic, and a tad too driven by blind faith.   The absurd storyline is only surpassed by the countless missed opportunities to offer readers something real, something tangible, something useful.  Basically anybody can write a piece of nonsensical overkill, but who has the want or the time to read it? So Far From God, more like So Far From Good 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 Blum's style is horrendous.  She traipses from one anecdote about her son to the findings of scientists she has interviewed without the blink of an eye.  She does not so much advance arguments or conclusions as much as merely advance dumbed-down versions of scientific studies.  Matters such as which questions underlie the research and what the research reveals are interspersed with bad puns and Blum's own opinion as to whether something is insulting or disgusting.  Her attempts to lighten the fare are patronizing and distracting.  She wrote way too much about non-humans.  This or that primate species is simply not the human species.  The differences between them are so great that their relevance for the human species does not seem to be established.    Most of the research she chose was physiological, behavioral, and anthropological.  Evolutionary biology (a.k.a. sociobiology) gets only occasional treatment, despite its recent progress in explaining male and female differences.    Note also that the book was published in 1997.  I write in 2005, so the book is eight years old.  Try to find something more up to date on the subject.  Overall, the book's faults can most easily be attributed to the fact that the author is a journalist and not a scientist.  She sarificed too much to appealing to the general readership and is not well-schooled in the science of human sex differences herself 
 I bought the CD because I watched David Gilmour on AOL's Sessions Archive and they played Comfortably Numb. I love that song.  This CD is a disappointment.  Even Comfortably Numb sounds better sung by David and his band then it did back in 1979.    Save your money.  This is just more of Roger Water's ranting and raving.  He, for some reason, wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes across.  I hope David and his present band make and album with old Pink Floyd favorites.  They are so much better now, both vocally and accoustcally 
 Another reaction to scholarly works which posit anything contrary to "the truth" contained within the Bible.  Let me quote Carl Sagan (yes, yes, I know that he was a professed atheist, but bear with me here):  "In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion. [Carl Sagan, 1987 CSICOP keynote address]  What really burns me down about pieces like this is that in the case of belief, there seems to be this imbalance of fact. Not so much that there is an blatant absence of factual, testable evidence that there really was/is a Jesus or God for that matter to begin with, but that when confronted with any actual evidence contrary to these, the problems begin. And the problems are these: even though all of what Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hopi Indians, or whoever is primarily based upon faith and belief, anything contrary or challenging to these must be automatically backed up by extraordinary or incontrovertible evidence.  WHAT? Wait, let me get this straight: You have faith in something that you have little to absolutely no proof of, and yet when scholarly work presents evidence to the contrary of what you believe based upon faith and little to no proof, that scholarly work needs to back up what it has found with mounds of factual, provable evidence? Does anyone else see a problem here?  Look, the FACT of this matter is that until people just get their heads out of their collective rears about their "beliefs" and learn that anything, and I mean ANYthing is vulnerable to being DISproven, and when they decide to OPEN THEIR MINDS to other possibilities, this world will be pretty much the most messed up place ever.  This piece attempts to block that open-mindedness and fails miserably.  Reactionism to anything that threatens a dogma or a belief without incontrovertible or compelling factual evidence is bunk.  Those who write reactionary pieces expect and criticize this from contrary writings.  Why shouldn't they be held to the same standard?  Simply because it is the so-called "Word of God?"  I believe that this God would hold things to a higher standard.  Just because it is written and has been ratified (and edited) by a council which was politically motivated and charged by an emperor to meet his needs and not those of the truth and the people does not make it truth.  And the belief (notice I wrote "belief" and not "fact") that there is no way whatsoever that it can be proven as divinely inspired and that the men (note, no women there) who were charged with ratifying and editing the "Gospels" were lead by the Holy Spirit to do anything.  More likely they were paid very well and got exactly what their leaders desired:  more power and control over the masses, more land and more influence, and finally more wealth so that they could continue to contain the beliefs of the uneducated.  Today we call this "Fascism."  Then it was called "divinely inspired."  And speaking of Fascism, this work is tantamount at an attempt to silence critics of the Bible.  This act, unabated by the Constitution of the United States, would also move well into the realm of Fascist propaganda.  Thank God (?) for men who saw that the tyranny of not only that states but the churches as well should not govern the people.  Now THAT is what I would call "divinely inspired!"  Simply stated:  when reactionary rhetoric can complete a factual, evidential treatise which can counter Biblical criticism, then the masses will listen with a discerning ear and see what is fact and what is fiction (faith?).  Until then nice try....  [...] 
 find an old edition of this book if the editions are similar.  The cases in it are old so the law isn't really changing so if you can tolerate not being on the exact same page in class & can deal with figuring out the different pages save your money since this text is hard to follow! the notes and problems aren't helpful 
 It is quite difficult to me to feel anything but a benign "that's interesting" type of indifference to this book. On some things, Fukuyama does rather well. On others, I could not resist the urge to rhetorically ask myself: "Did he really get this published?"   First, the good stuff. As others have noted, Fukuyama provides decent factual documentation and analysis to support part 1 of his argument - that the social bonds common to the days of yore have dissipated through time (aside from a few contradictions that I'll get to later). He also provides a quite lively, if a tad oversimplified and/or overeager, section on the life sciences' recent findings that we are social creatures after all.   So that accounts for the two extant stars. What accounts for the three I decided to withhold? First, and most devestatingly, Fukuyama never makes it clear how this dissipation of 'social capital' can be attributed to the 'information revolution' - the transition from an industrial-based to information-based economy or culture. It seems his only strategy is to rule out, curtly and unconvincingly, other variables only to tell us: "Well it couldn't be those, and since the timing is right, so it must be the information revolution." I don't buy it (yet), and don't see how Fukuyama expects me to.   Second, there are an embarassing number of out-and-out contradictions in this book. First, there is the biggie: Fukuyama spends a lot of time telling us that via human nature, the rebuilding of social bonds is endemic and inevitable to humankind. Then, in the next section, he tells us that we must work dilligently to bring about what he just told us was endemic and inevitable. (This is reminiscent of Marx telling us that the revolution was inevitable and that therefore, the workers must be dillegent in ensuring that it comes about).   There are other contradictions: Fukuyama tells us in the book that crime is and has been on the rise for some time. A bit later, though, he tells us that the vast majority of American neighborhoods are safe and that it is only people's perception of rising crime via the media tht seems to be the problem. He also tells us that marriages dissolving in their first few years is a new frightening trend, while later in the book teling us that it is "not uncommon" for marriages to dissipate only after the kids are raised. I just don't understand!   Anyhow, I could go on, but I'd rather get to my main point: although this book may have a few eye opening moments (generally those moments where Fukuyama is reinforcing things we already know), all in all, it is not worth your time. If you want to explore the weakening of the 'social fabric' try Etzionni's "The Spirit of Community" or Callahan's "The Cheating Culture." If you are interested in the life sciences' research on the sociality of humans, try Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue," or Axelrod's 'Evolution of Cooperation.' Both do a better job than this book. 
 IF I EVER GET IT, I WILL BE HAPPY TO REVIEW IT 
 these people who give this soundtrack 5 stars are sick in the head you cant be serious this is pure junk they act like this is classic music this stuff is tras 
 Do not expect much of an wisdom here. The book has enough material for maybe a one page pamphlet. The rest is war stories without beginnings or endings. It also would have been better to leave the reading to native speakers only 
 I got this as a gift, so I don't know anything about it except what my son has said 
 I couldn't even get 2 chapters into the book. It is that boring to me! Might try and read some other time but for now, going back to the library it goes 
 Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 Jay Conrad Levinson presents his thesis clearly time and time again in his book. In fact, he presents everything again and again. Each thought it reinforced at least 4 times in a dry and uninspired manner. Although Levinson tries to present marketing tactics that only a small business can use, he ends up presenting large-business tactics at a small scale. This book leaves out ground which has been broken by Loyalty Based marketing tactics, and sticks to traditional measures that are hardly relevant (at best) to entrepreneurs. The bottom line: invest your money elsewhere 
 Terrible.  Tried several positions (flat and upright), nothing seemed to improve reception.  May as well not have been plugged in at all.  Let's say the 1 star is for the lighted green dial on the front, since I can't give it zero stars.. 
 After one play through it was obvious why this was her worst selling CD. I will admit to liking some of Spears earlier stuff but on this CD she abandons her pop styling to go more hip hop. Sure that may appeal to a new audience but in honesty, if you liked the other stuff, this ain't that. If you were not bothering with her because you liked hip-hop and couldn't bother with her pop, there is no reason why you would have paid attnetion to it 
 In Lieu of a Review What follows is a slightly edited letter sent via e-mail over a year ago to Ben Corbett, author of This is Cuba, an Outlaw Culture Survives. It has not been answered.    Ben:  A recent newspaper article about the tattoo business in Cuba mentioned your book, reminding me that I had meant to let you know what I thought of it. By way of introduction, I met your friend M several months ago. She is a friend of L and our meeting was set up largely because I am a partisan of the Cuban revolution. We had what I thought was a good discussion. I don't think the Cubans you portrayed are very representative of the country. In your book I met tourist-hustlers, prostitutes, a pensioner or two, and some of the unemployed hanging out in the park. No cane-cutters or factory workers. None of the hundreds of thousands of veterans of military missions to Angola, Ethiopia, or other countries, or of the teachers, health professionals and construction workers that have worked all over the underdeveloped world. Even when you introduce a member of the Communist Party, she's an art professor who is also a Seventh Day Adventist! And deliberately contravening policy about crowding into the capital, "just to be there." In your defense of civil liberties in the Cuban "police state," I got the impression you were defending the "pickpockets, purse-snatchers and burglars" that were preying on tourists. Are they some sort of "entrepreneurs" to you? Your infatuation with "outlaw culture" (obviously influenced by "anti-establishment" sentiments here, but radically out of place in the very different society in Cuba) leads you to glorify some very negative elements. The story of the "extra" bags of rice is indicative: A warehouse administrator, a truck driver & and an enterprising black-marketeer combine to steal a few bags of rice from a government shipment. And sell their take privately, for a highly inflated price (to cover everyone's cut and a "fair" profit, of course). You seem to see this as an example of some sort of resourcefulness. What I see are people who have either given up on the revolution (very likely, I will grant you, due to its hardships) or who never were part of it. They are "looking out for No. 1."  These are the kind of people who formed the social basis for the rise of the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. The first step is securing a privileged position for yourself and a small group of similar types. The need for a police state flows from the defense of those privileges against the rest of the people. There are lots of people like that in Cuba. Thankfully, government leaders and most of the members of the Communist Party fight them as best they can. Kind of a vicious circle, don't you see? Underdevelopment, poverty and scarcity (in large part due to the US embargo) encourage such "underground" forms of economic activity. At the same time, such "siphoning off" of resources multiplies the difficulties in getting needed supplies to the mass of the population.  The urge, on the part of a minority in a position to aprovechar (to profit or take advantage) grows at the same time as demands mount by the rest of the people to crack down on thievery and privilege. Is there tension at times between "the people" and the Communist Party and the government? Yes. It grows out of the conflict between the mass and those bureaucrats that seek to form a privileged caste. There is also tension within the party and the government between revolutionaries and bureaucrats. There is a constant fight going on. Some of the flashpoints have been the Escalante affairs in the `60s, the "rectification campaign" and Ochoa affair in the `80s, and the entire "Special Period" since the disappearance of Soviet aid. I think the revolutionaries should be supported in this fight. Do you really think that if the handful of Cubans you seem to think are so repressed were allowed to run home-restaurants and mango-juice businesses unimpeded, life would improve for the vast majority? I think it would lead to the institutionalization of privilege based on wealth. From there you go to Stalinist-style repression to defend said privilege or to a restoration of capitalism (which would mean a return to neocolonial status, as there is no Cuban capitalist class with the wherewithal to hold off penetration by US capital). The majority of Cuban workers and farmers rightly see no prospects for themselves in either alternative. It's not repression by the government that keeps people away from the so-called dissidents and hustlers, it's the realization of the horrors they would be subject to if the revolution were overthrown.  Ben, I doubt that you think US society is the highpoint of human civilization. I am sure that you object to the commercial venality, inequality, violence and dog-eat-dog character of our existence here. Your book, however, seems to idealize those Cubans most disposed towards the economic system that gives rise to those problems. Class biases shine through your writing. By that I mean you come across (I believe that any book, no matter its subject, is really about its author) as a late 20th-century white middle-class American. A particularly glaring example: Your jinotero (hustler) buddy, Juan, is busted for the last time and given the choice of jail or job training (what a police state!). So now he's an apprentice brick mason. "Deep down he doesn't like it. He's an intelligent businessman, not a slave laborer." I'm not sure if that's his thought or yours, possibly a shared view. But, do you know how insulting that is to the vast majority of the people, not just of Cuba, but of the US and the rest of the world? "Businessmen" have no more native intelligence than any wageworkers, farmers or landless laborers. "Being your own boss" is a petit bourgeois fantasy, born of desires to ape the lifestyle of "one's betters." Accidents of birth, access to capital, and, yes a little luck have a lot more to do with "entrepreneurial success," than "intelligence" and "hard work." In the US, I doubt if you view grasping, cheating "cockroach capitalists" as leading the charge for significant social change. Their noses are too firmly pressed to the asses of the wealthiest "intelligent businessmen" to see where they or society are going. What makes you think their Cuban imitators are any better? I don't think Cuba's interference with the capitalist law of value is repression. It's a pre-condition for turning society away from selfishness and (unfair) competition, toward human solidarity and cooperation. You seem a little weak on Marxist theory: "...communism is...based on the principle that `each person receives equally according to his need.' The principles of Socialism say that `each person receives according to his labors.' The current Cuban reality and the super-human standards of Communist dogma, however, are rarely in harmony." The actual quote from Marx, "...from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," expresses relations within a communist system. Communism, though, is based on advanced technology and material abundance: "...slavery cannot be abolished without the steam-engine and the mule jenny, serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture, and...in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity." Socialism is transitional to communism. Short of full material abundance, what is received must be limited, "to each according to his labor." It's supposed to be temporary. Trouble is, the anti-capitalist revolutions we know have taken place in underdeveloped and/or war-shattered countries.  Combining that with fierce capitalist resistance, the "development of productive forces" that Marx called the "absolutely necessary practical premise" of communism has yet to be established. And he pointed out the danger that "without it privation, want is merely made general again, and all the filthy business would necessarily be restored." (the Marx quotes are from The German Ideology and Critique of the Gotha Program). The difference between the Cuban revolution and all the others we saw in the 20th century is that it has a leadership that resists the "filthy business." The heroes of "This is Cuba" are part of the problem, not part of the solution. I found it galling that you let the United States completely off the hook for any problems existent in Cuba. No discussion of 60 years of neocolonialism, the theft of resources and wealth, or the repressive regimes sponsored to oversee all that. No discussion of Giron, the October Crisis, The Torrecelli and Helms-Burton Acts, or the Cuban Adjustment Act. In your view, the embargo is a political hobbyhorse of Fidel's.  Your idealization of "the global market economy," of "a full dollar economy" as solutions betrays a middle class bias toward the accumulation of wealth by a few as the answer to social problems. Look at what's going on in Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Mexico. Would you claim that the mass of people of those countries is better off after a decade or more of "globalization" and "neo-liberal capitalism?" Cubans are better off now than in 1991 and '92. While they were forced to legalize the dollar, entice foreign investors, and open wide to tourism, with the inequalities and problems attendant to all that, their government did not sell off any national industries. Hospitals and neighborhood clinics did not close. Free education continued. Daycare centers and libraries stayed open. While there may not be a lot more than beans and rice, the malnutrition endemic throughout Latin America is absent from Cuba. If Fidel is a "dictator," he shows an inordinate fondness for the social well being of his country, a rather uncommon trait among caudillos (Latin American Spanish for political boss).  Actually, I thought your treatment of Fidel and your speculations about Cuba after his death the weakest parts of your book: a melange of bourgeois journalism, State Department estimates, leaked "intelligence reports," Miami Mafia gossip, and wishful thinking of Havana's chattering class.  Remember, in Miami back in '91 and '92, they were practically dancing in the streets, predicting the fall of the "puppet" due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. If the "opposition" was ever going to advance beyond the circles of hangers-on of the US Interests Section and economic privateers, that was the time to do it. Nothing happened. I have no "inside dope" on what plans or preparations, outside of the provisions of the Cuban constitution, exist for the inevitable transition, but I am sanguine, as are I believe most Cubans, that there won't be any big problems. Time, as always, will tell. Anyway, thank you for an interesting and challenging book, tommyboy544@yahoo.com   
 I ordered this once, the order got cancelled, and I hurriedly ordered it again, so eager was I to read it based on what I'd heard. What I'd heard was wrong. In addition to rambling on about himself and/or nothing, Armstrong offers only warmed-over advice from other published books on writing. That's right, he's done no original research with any primary sources whatsoever. He takes lots of advice from King's _On Writing_ (making sure also to tell us in detail about King's van accident and how the driver was found dead the following year...and what does this have to do with advice on how not to write a novel?) and plenty of mildly relevant personal experiences, such as joining the Crime Writers' Association (though he didn't have much time to devote to it because he'd just started a new romantic relationship, you see). The advice he offers isn't bad (with one exception), but you could easily cut out the middleman by buying this advice in its original packaging rather than Amrstrong's dull recycling.  The exception to the good advice is the repeatd mantra: Don't do it. Don't be a writer. Just don't do it, you'll regret it, and so on. This would have been clever once or twice, but he does it over and over and over again. Excuse me, but if I weren't serious about writing I probably wouldn't have bought your f*cking book, now, would I? As if a single book is going to talk me--or anybody else--out of it.   This is minor compared to the other flaws the book contains, but Armstrong and/or his editor have absolutely no idea how to punctuate. He sprinkles commas, liberally, throughout, to the point where, they make no sense and, slow down, or stop your comprehension. This leads as well to some truly leviathan sentences--I counted no fewer than 9 clauses in one of them. Sheesh 
 It looks like metal but it was as soft as a cardborard. Terrible 
 Not really worth the cost if you've seen the anime.  The book is full color, but the screencaptures used seem to be of a poor quality, occasionally being grainy or fuzzy, and really take away from the reading experience.  Goes through the first six anime episodes.  A very limited use of any sound effect descriptors, and a lot of poor choices for images when used with the speech bubbles; which incidentally seem to pop out of the page and make it harder to read.  Anyone who was new to this particular series would probably have a hard time following the plot simply from the book itself 
 Geesh people...Walmart is not Satan, Barney is not the devil, and Sponge Bob Square Pants is not gay!!!!  I guess the great unwashed public will always have to have a scapegoat for their own inadequacies!!!  Grow up people and try not to blame others for your own faults! 
 One of my roommates recently received this books as a gift. My curiousity got the better of me, and I picked it up to peruse it. With my sincerest apologies to the author, this has to be the worst version of any thesaurus I have seen to date. Of just a few words I decided to look up, and by no means were any of the words for the "extremely literate", I was unable to find even one of them. The volume of words in the collection are extremely limited, and synonyms provided are also limited. There are much better books available, in fact, almost any other thesaurus is better, even "pocket versions" of another thesaurus would prove more useful. My guess is that this book is the choice of the egotistical; a bookshelf trophy that serves no purpose other than to suggest superior intellect, and collect dust. The only positive aspect I can think of towards this publication is that it is sure to make the insecure feel "extraordinarily literate". If you want a valuable resource to broaden your vocabulary, this isn't the right book 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
       !!!!!!!!!!DONT BUY!!!!  NUFF SAI 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 Don't fall for this. The authors are conservative propagandists who engage in the kind of fake scholarship that the American Enterprise Institute and its ilk specializes in. Remember when you were first learning to write a term paper and the teacher said "don't make the facts fit your argument; your argument has to rest on the facts"? Well the authors were busy running for class president and missed that little lesson. In their world, there is no reason to worry about discrimination laws, or social security, or poverty relief because no-one is ever destitute, excluded or unable to get decent work. Anyone with a passing acquaintance with reality can recognise this for the class warfare that it really is 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie 
 I took my niece skating last night with these skates.  They were forever coming unstrapped - and actually fell off her foot once.  They look nice - but not safe at all 
 We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.    
 This "author", and I use that term loosely, has the nerve to write several "customer reviews" (as opposed to editorial reviews, which she is obviously not qualified to do) on several ground breaking amd creative books regarding social and economic conditions. For what reason? To shamelessly promote her own book. This is a pathetic attempt to plug her own work, and its a disgrace to legitimate authors. She ought to be ashamed of herself, not only for her comments, but for this pathetic literary attempt. Shame on you Kathy Sherman. 
 It's a wonder how people (99% anonymous) can write glowing reviews of this book and throw around words casually like "compelling", "powerful", etc. It's also a shame to see people so blindly read the INTERPRETATION of what this woman read as being her grandmother's history.   Another point about this novel - Who cares! It's a book about her supposed discovery of her heritage, of which she researches, writes, gets published and gets paid for. Does your story really warrant a book? Why don't the lot of us do exactly as Ms. Lee does and discover our own lost heritage, write about it, and package it as our own [insert background title here]? Apparently since her publishing, the likes of which people strangely lap up and call "amazing", Lee is now on the lecture circuit, going from one university to another lecturing on this. Is this for real? Is she now a certified expert in Korean history? Do not pass Go, do not collect your PH.D in History, instead write a fictitious book based on archival information and go straight to expert? Give me a break. This book is contrived.    1/5 stars. 
 Attn all students! Amazon promises to send books by a specific date then changes the dates without your consent. Trying to get a refund is a nightmare. Be prepared to get stuck without the book and still get the bill. Customer service is outsourced to India and is no help even if you could understand them. 4 wks and counting and still no promised refund. This not the only time this has happened.The issue is not with the seller it is Amazon 
 MAn, what a boring book! Ok, anyone inhis right frame of mind by now has already undertood that Bush has been practicing foul play all aorund in his war decisions. Everybody by now knows that the reasons given to go to Iraq were fake, a total lie. But Barber uses two hundred pages to sing a single song: opreventive democracy is better than preventive war. Sure. But he uses almost 300 hundred pages of the same arguments, making this a lame reading 
 Zero 7 are my favourite artists of all time, so I decided to start listening to the individual artists, such as Sophie Barker, Sia Furler and Tina Dico. Sophie was the one who sang 'In Time' and 'Destiny' among others. These are two of my favourite songs by Zero 7. However, I am extremely disappointed by Sophie's solo CD. It's not the same style or sound, it has no songs that I would pick out as a really good piece of music, and her voice doesn't sound nearly half as impressive as it did in the Zero 7 songs. Overall I regret buying this CD and would tell people to forget Sophie and stick to Tina Dico and Sia - both their individual albums are good, and show that they work well both alone and in a group. Earthbound is a good title only because that's what the music is like, very earthy and almost like she's been living in the woods all her life trying to be like a fairy or something. Yeah... I just don't like it 
 Although I think the assists in the book are valid and useful, assisting should NOT be learned from a book: only with a real live yoga instructor who really knows what they're doing! Assists can be dangerous.  Your own body needs to feel the assist before you do it to someone else. Work with a competent instructor before trying these methods 
 Sloppy writing, worse mindfulness.  What has this guy done?  All he does is critize everyone else for their efforts.  How well could he do?    The system is corrupt.  Good people will surely fail in such a system.  Why blame the people.  Follow the money stupid.    The book does not go to the heart of the matter.  If Democrats and Greens start listening to this guy they will all end up chasing their tails.    Frank's work outside this book is more of the same.  Tearing down people for not being successful enough, then suspecting their motives for it without any evidence, only hearsay and lack of success.    I'm tired of rants and complainers.  Let's see you do better, Frank.  
 The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event. There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much). There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket. Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches. If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will 
 not to bash the doc's...but this is the worst ive heard. I bought "Pocket Full of Kryptonite" on a whim, absolutely loved it, and bought this album just 20 minutes ago. simply awful...redundant, whiny, the vocals barely held a note. the only bearable song is sister sysiphus. If you like their sound, get pocket full of kryptonite 
 If a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you, does that mean it's a good book or a bad book?  In the case of MERCY, I'll have to go with the latter.  I found I could not get past my intense dislike of both Cam and Mia, truly two of the most despicable, selfish characters I've ever read in any book.  I've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities.  Their sole intent were their own wants and needs, regardless of who (Cam's wife Allie) got hurt.  Allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over.  I never got that impression.  She was the owner of her own business, and she was determined to help Cam's cousin Jamie.  She also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband.  It was her love and loyalty that Cam felt totally comfortable in betraying.  At one point late in the book, Allie asks Cam if he and Mia had laughed at her.  He tells her no.  However in a way, they did, considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed.  I felt for Allie.  She deserved far better then Cam  I really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia.  Instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love.  Infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of Picoult's books (I understand her latest book, THE TENTH CIRCLE is no different.)  She is without a doubt an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't for me 
 This version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the DVD and listed in the IMDb.  I saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again, but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie.  The DVD packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by Amazon.  They made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done.  I do not recommend this version to anyone.  The orginal movie deserves better than this chop job 
 I would have left this book in the airline seat back on my way to the exit.  I anticipated the follow-up to the first Frankenstein novel and wasn't disapointed by the intensity or unique spin on an old story.  But, and maybe this happens with novelists who write so many stories, I couldn't help thinking that a lot of this I had seen before. For example:  1) Plucky girl cop and wisecracking boy cop sidekick. Didn't we see this in Dragon Tears?  2) Endless knocks on contemporary American society. OK Mr. Koontz, we get it, the modern world is bad. We're sorry. We promise to try harder. We saw all of this most recently in The Face and the Odd Thomas series.  3) Angelic autistic child (or child with some other disability). The Seize the Night series, From the Corner of his Eye, and a lot of other books I can't seem to remember.  4) Tortured priest who struggles with an end times calamity and the changes that are happening to his body and psyche.  But wait, there is at least a bonus! No thinking super dogs that can save the universe if we all just hugged them more.  Koontz tends to go over the top when he talks about contemporary times. Really Mr. Koontz, we're not that bad. This moralizing detracts from the pacing and quality of his work and I wish he would stop.   The third Frankenstein book is probably going to be the last Koontz book I will read. While I like most of the characters he's created, and think many of his story lines are interesting, I am tired of being preached at and lectured to.  Reader tip: I've noticed on long driving trips that Koontz novels sound better in audio than they do when read 
 Had forgotten I even bought it.  Have not looked at it, other than to glance through when it first came. 
 Dr. Andrew Fielding, a quantum physicist, is killed, although it's made to look like he died of natural causes. David Tennant, MD, assumes he's next. They are two of the six men in the inner circle of the scientific team funded by National Security Agency working on Project Trinity.  Trinity is a massive, secret (big surprise!) government-funded effort to build a supercomputer dedicated to artificial intelligence - a computer that thinks. David is on the team to keep the ethics in line, as he is a Professor of Ethics at the University of Virginia Medical School. He has been seeing a psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, the past few months because of his narcolepsy, the side effect he encountered after undergoing his `superscan' into the Trinity computer. All six of the inner circle had been scanned and each had a different side effect. Thus, his crusade to find the cause of everyone's neurological symptoms.  David figures out who killed Dr. Fielding, so he and Rachel have to make a run for it. The story details their narrow escapes, David's realization of who is betraying him, and how he overcomes these difficulties. Who do you trust is really a big question. Trinity `goes live' and causes chaos and confusion around the world. David and Rachel play a big part in getting Trinity working for good, not evil.  This was a tad too sci-fi for my taste and too long, partly because of the detailed descriptions of David's hallucinations (where he sometimes sees himself as Jesus).  If you're a computer nut and like technical subjects, you'll like this book 
 It's often better to know certain people only through their works, and to avoid altogether what passes for a biography written by "long-time  friends." This is the overview he was afraid of reading, what had to  wait to be written until his passing? There is no semblance of objective  distance in this book. Even the most awful, and possibly revealing, aspects  of this man's life--chief among them the suicide of his sixty-nine year old  wife of more than four decades--are glossed over and swept aside, the  authors preferring to concentrate on his happiness in taking up with the  wife of one of his friends soon after. And there are countless mentions of  his "brilliant color sense"--a subjective talent, at best--to the  extent that by the end of the book you might believe that this was on par  with the cure for polio. Dr. Seuss was a wonderfully talented author of  children's books, and a worthy subject for an honest and well-rounded  biography. Unfortunately, this is not it. Go back and read "Green Eggs  and Ham" again. Go read "The Cat in the Hat." Leave this  alone 
 This is the worst book that you can have at home. It has a lot of negativism and not good things. For school I have to do it a report, but for me I wouldn't buy it.  I put 1 start because I can't put 0 
 I have read many books on MPD/DID, and this one is the least interesting and helpful thus far.  I do not wish to take any personal jabs at the author, however, MPD/DID is obviously not her only disorder.  By the time you get to the end of the book and read about more post-healing "tragedies" and abuse, one gets the feeling that the author thrives on such drama.  When people write autobigraphies, they take the reader into their world. I do not wish to be dragged into this author's world.  It's not about happy endings, but it is about wanting to read truly good books written by truly healthy people who have truly overcome 
 I got this product to help me sleep and it did NOT work for me.  I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the pain killer.  I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired.  It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.  Not only did it not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times during the night.  I think I would have done better without it.  But everyone reacts to drugs differently, so try at your own risk 
 When I first heard about this book, I rushed to find it on Amazon and added it to my wish list.  I patiently awaited it's release and was very happy to receive my copy.  After savoring it for a day or so I sat down and began to read it.  My wife, who does not understand, but accepts, my addiction to fantasy sports, thought I would finish the book in a day or two.  After watching me read a few pages and put it down and then read a few more pages and put it down again, she asked why I hadn't finished already.  "To be honest," I said "it's just missing something and I can't seem to get into it."  Maybe it was the exhaustingly long email threads that attempted to hold chapters together or the never ending use of unrelated lists that seemd to do nothing more than fill space, but this book just didn't do it for me.  To be fair, I think I may have been comparing it too heavily to "Committed, Confessions of a Fantasy Football Junkie." by Mark St. Amant.  In my opinion, that book (released in 2004) truly captured the enjoyment, humor and obsession that I've experienced in so many fantasy football leagues.  "Why Fantasy Football Matters..." simply does not compare to that superior effort.  The book did make me laugh from time to time and a few passages did remind me of the leagues in which I participate.  I do not feel, however, that I can recommend it.  If you want to read an extremely well written tale that captures the humor and blinding obsession that surrounds fantasy football, pass by this title and grab a copy of "Committed..."  I've already started to reread it myself.   
 I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the old Shaft episodes, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Shaft prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed! The acting is about average with the exception of Samuel Jackson who carries out his performance very well (as always), and Jeffrey Wright who really steals the show as Basquiat, the gangster.  Regarding the plot, it is weak; the chances that the character, Walter Wade Jr., would provoke and then deliver as he does are way beyond "slim!"  The desperate need to demonize what W.W. Jr. represents gets tiring after the first 1000 or so movies!  Enough is enough!  The same applies for main characters with "chips on their shoulders!"  Let's move on please! As for having Vanessa Williams (who is GORGEOUS!) play in this film and not have a single nude scene (in this R Rated movie!) with her is such a WASTE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. 
 The writing is uninspired.  The organization is poor.  Evidence is largely anecdotal.  After reading the review in Scientific American, perhaps I was expecting too much, but this book was not at all what I had hoped for 
 I found this book to be very depressing and dark.  The author kept saying how cancer will haunt you the rest of your life, little hope to escape it, you'll just have to live with it.  I've choosen differently, but this book was NOT helpful in my after treatment recovery 
 I own other Dover art books, and they are wonderful books, but the content of this one was a bit disappointing to me. I was really hoping for more pirate pieces. The famous cover used on Treasure Island is not even included. These seemed to be more obscure pieces that I had never seen before. I don't know, if you're a huge Pyle fan, then you might really enjoy it, but if you are looking for his art that you've seen printed in countless pirate books like me...this is not going to impress you much. 
 This book seems like a series of complaints.  The main character complains about some Asian-Americans are too "Asian" or "not Asian enough".  It is as if she can't find a happy medium to live in.  A guy she goes on a date with is into fast cars and karaoke, which is supposedly too "Asian".  But a guy who can't use chopsticks well enough isn't "Asian" enough.  The author seems to like to add name brands of clothing into the soryline as well.  I don't think the public really cares that the character is wearing something Kenneth Cole or Gap.  Is she trying to promote something that I'm not aware of?  Perhaps because I am also Asian-American, and can't understand why someone would write a book of complaints about being Asian-American.  Maybe it is because I don't entounter these problems on a daily basis like the character. 
 The movie "Boo" features terrible acting, and a deplorable plot.  The movie is executed very poorly and simply fails to elicit any scares in a sophisticated horror movie audience.  The name of this movie is stupid and so is the movie itself.  If you buy this garbage thinking you're going to see a good scary movie, you are going to be grossly disappointed with this movie's merits as a horror movie.  This film failed to generate any laughs in me about how terrible it was, and that is really sad.  After viewing this garbage, I just came away thinking this was truly a sad piece of rubbish.  There's really no other way to put it.  If you want to see a good and scary movie about a hospital or mental institution, I recommend "Session 9" which is a good overall horror movie, especially when compared to, ahem, "Boo".  
 Porter writes as if the North was never wrong, its commanders never fooled or mistaken, its armies never disspirited, and that the Union campaigns always succeeded. We all should know better. According to Porter, every time the Confederates didn't hold a field they were "repulsed handsomely." Every time the Union didn't hold the field, they were merely "compelled to retire." You will see these gross aberrations throughout this stale and shoddy work. His characterizations add nothing fresh about the famous personages surrounding him, and certainly his military perspective offers less in quality of insight than the diary of any Union private. There are many great books on the Civil War by the figures who fought it: this one can wait until you've exhausted everything else 
 Both of my grandparents fought in WWII on the soviet side, so I'm pretty comfortable with the subject. I've read alot of good stuff about Mr. David Glantz from american, german and russian sources(check out battlefield.ru, choose english language option at the top left, awesome site with lots of info on the subject as well as overview of Mr.Glantz books). In any case this effort by Mr.Glantz is not a book and this is surely can't be called an encyclopedia of Eastern front. This is nothing shourt but a Eastern front for dummies. From a man who knows so much on Eastern front and has access to so much information this book is a joke. 
 I heard Cadillac Tears on the internet so I thought I'd check out the cd. After checking out the songs I figured I'd pass on the cd.  The only one that has individuality is "Cadillac Tears".  The rest are all the same old new country ballads. I will download CTs and be happy 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 Wish I had not bought this book; didn't have recipes my family enjoys, and no pictures. Normally we cook tacos, hamburger helper, pastas, etc. I was looking for easy and heathly recipes to replace these, but I wasn't impressed with this book 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 A friend gave me this book suggesting that I would enjoy it, and I  dutifully read it. I wish I'd spent my time differently. There are some  good jokes in it, but all in all, it's not very enlightening 
 I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
 I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like "Toy Story." The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and "delicate" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child 
 Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the "Frankenstein-like" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.  Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.  Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's "The Beyond" ranks way 'beyond' this however 
 This video is all hype and delivers nothing.  I love dancing.  Dancing in this video is horrible.  For the latin section, there was hardly anything LATIN about it!  It was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them.  Ick!  Not too mention it's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added.  I love Latin dancing and didn't enjoy this at all.  The other dancing sections were equally cheesy.  They were soo cheesy I just felt like an idiot doing them.  If you are not at a stage in life where you still go to clubs/go out, i.e. 40+) then you MIGHT enjoy this.  If you do currently go out dancing it's just going to be torture.   As for the workout, very low-intensity and lots of lulls as another reviewer said.  Definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing (because this is horrible) or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up.  I wouldn't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy.  I think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem!  Don't waste your money....  there are lots of better vids out there.  This is awful 
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 I thought this toy looked fantastic as I was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew. The versitility of this one looks great. Well, I liked it more than either one of my children did, as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom! The black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that, it just got taken apart and lost its interest, no matter which way i arranged the peices. Infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads 
 As you can tell by the title, I'm not enamored of this magazine. I've been playing video games since the early 80s, and have read many, many gaming magazines. My reasons for this negative review of Gamepro follow in no particular order: 1.) Their numerical rating system stinks. 1-5 points is just not accurate enough. Most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals. Not Gamepro. 2.) The written part of the reviews are way too short, and often are written borderline incoherantly. It's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out. 3.) Often times they cram two or three reviews on one page. Screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp. 4.) The number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high. Once when I was bored, I counted all the ads in one issue. Out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads. 5.) Their article layouts are confusing, and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color. Forget about reading it if you're colorblind. 6.) Their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out, or plain don't work. I suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites. 7.) Gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags, such as EGM and Game Informer. So, in closing... if you want a good gaming magazine, just about any magazine other than Gamepro would be an improvement. Many great gaming magazines have come and gone, why a turd like Gamepro continues is a mystery to me 
 I am a great admirer of David Suchet's Poirot, but I found this production disappointing.  Despite being filmes in Egypt with breathtaking scenery, most of the touches of warmth and humour that make a Christie novel such a pleasure to read are missing from this production.  The three young people in the love triangle that is the basis for the mystery all seemed to me entirely lacklustre.  The worst thing of all though, is that two of the most charming and interesting people in the book, Timothy Allerton and his delightful mother, have had their characters grotesquely distorted until they bear virtually no resemblance to their originals, and there is a quite gratuitous and disgusting implication of an incestuous relationship between them which is certainly not implied in any way in Agatha Christie's novel.  The girl who, in the book, Timothy Allerton loves, has had her character changed and subdued until she barely makes any impact on the story at all.  All this makes this a very disappointing production.  The Ustinov film is better 
 These rather dated arrangements lack the drama and beauty of the original soundtracks.  Also, the entire album is only 28 minutes long.  It's definitely not worth paying full price for 
 this book is very helpful for both of us,we love to read this book together and try everything they mention...lots of fun 
 This book is a huge disappointment.  Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance.  At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.  You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people. 
 Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.   As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.   There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best. 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 This book is guaranteed to make you fall asleep. Some people take a glass of warm milk, others taking sleeping tablets; But this book has absolutely no side effects and is can make *anybody* fall asleep within 10 minutes! Try it for yourself.. 
 that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help! My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.  This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO     
 This book is only for women that has problems with having an orgasm. For the rest it is very boring, dry reading. You will learn a couple of new things but I don't know if that is worth reading the whole book 
 I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it.  The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos.  It seems more like  a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 I only have three words for this bit of tripe Boring,Boring,Boring. 
 I found this book filled with far too much fluff and not enough valuable information.  The author told far too many stories and never really got to the point.  Generally I enjoy storytelling as a method of learning but this was over the top.  Go flip through the book before you buy to decide if it's worth it to you 
 I thought this book read like it was translated form a foreign language several times before it got to english.  I spent so much time and effort trying to quote decipher references and credits I found it very difficult  to read.  It seemed like every sentence started outlike this   "According to Inyuc Geronovitch on page three of his book  ......."  I think it may have been a good book but it was so  distracting to read.  I did not finish it.  I did not even get through the  first chapter I left it on an airplane.  There is no way you can Imagine  the Balkins with this book it is an absolute chore to read.  I would like  to tell the author to put up your thesaurus (we know you can use big words)   use foot notes do not start every sentence with with some credit to  someone.  Try to be less of a far out creative writer. AND JUST TELL THE  STOR 
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 I started buying Hotel Costes backwards starting from 6,5,4,then 2. Then I bought 3 and 1 and those two just wasn't as good as the others. Some what disappointed. At least know I know his newer ones are getting better and not worst, right 
 If I had known that this SACD was only a 2 channel SACD, I would not have even bothered.   Playing the original CD in all channel mode sounds better than this pile.   Man, after listening to (my only other SACDs, so far) Joe Satriani's Strange Beautiful Music, and the 30 year anniversary hybrid SACD of Dark Side of the Moon, (both amazing in 6 channel SACD) this was a huge letdown.  I like the album a lot, and am a big fan of The Police, but if you already have the original CD, THERE IS NO REASON to buy this thing, the better sampling rate doesn't help it a bit (get it?... hehehe).   Call The Police, I've been ripped-off.   !!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! 
 I should say first that this should be a good movie, at least on paper.  John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book.  Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film.  Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being "only a revolutionary from the waist down" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien.  The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the "news" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right.  All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 I must admit, the setup that Aimee Bender constructs is fascinating: a girl in a claustrophobic town with a strangely beautiful glass hospital quits everything she adores until her routine is disrupted by the threat of her carefully sheltered world coming crashing down. However, the array of what start out as endearingly delicious quirks in Mona and the townspeople can't sustain themselves and become tiresome and forced by the end of the book. I simply could not find it within myself to care for the fates of any of the characters, whose actions and fates are all too trite and predictable.   The most frustrating thing about this book is glimpsing the potential that it failed to live up to. The book seems to awkwardly straddle the line between the grippingly realistic and the delightfully dreamlike. It would have been effective either way, but in the middle ground it seemed to take, An Invisible Sign of My Own was dull and bizarre.   One of the many plot weaknesses pertains to Mona's professed adour for math, which seems to supplemented by a knowledge nothing more complex than long division, despite a high school education. And the question of Mona's education leads to a entirely new debacle of how she is qualified to be any sort of teacher. This could very well be nitpicking, but Bender certainly doesn't seem to have done her research or have constructed a world convincingly magical enough for a reader to overlook illogical characterizations and plot twists. Mona herself comes off as irritating in her self-destructive self-pity rather than sympathetic. Her students are laughably (and not in a good way) precocious, wholly unrealistic without being interesting, and not at all endearing. Her love interest has little depth besides the plot device role he is assigned.   I could not help thinking of the whole plot as a uncompelling and unskilled rehashing of Animal Dreams by Barbara Kingsolver, which I'd have gladly reread rather than waste my time on this one. This whole book reeks of trying too hard. 
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I just got this at a bargain price from Amazon.co.uk. Its great for completists and Meek collectors, and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s. But it's not very listenable. There are about four really good tracks on it, and no stars with the possible exception of Glenda Collins 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 I'm dissapointed at the arguments brougt forward by the philosopher in favor for the death penalty, Pojman. Even if you ignore the content of his arguments, the logic on which the argument was built didn't hold much  water. Even though I'm myself against the dead penalty, I have seen others  make a better and more coherent case for it. Pojmans last argument, that  people that are against the dead penalty and pro choice are somehow  immoral, is gratuitous and has nothing to do with an argument for the dead  penalty. I would have expected a more thourough and convincing case 
 Benjamin has written a highly valuable book here. My concern is with Verso's treatment of it. The binding is horrible -- my edition literally fell apart on the first read. There are no annotations which, in a book as wide-ranging and dense as this, is a gross oversight. In short, a horrible edition of a great book. Find another version. 
 The book is full of self-important drivel.  As a result, it lacks clarity and coherence 
 Really small book, but a great gift for those midgets in your life 
 This book is garbage.  It is just thrown together for the publisher and author to make money.  It is a very superficial review of cost accounting 
 It completely sucked. Very long with nothing to say. Author was proud of his own knowledge of the SCA and Wiccans, and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development. What's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters.  I now live overseas, so I bought a bunch of books in the "4 for 3" price discount section in order to save money. This is the first one I read of the received books. If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future 
 I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.  These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.  For the price, these can't be beat 
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 From the picture this looks like it's a solid wood toy chest.  Not so, the top is completely hollow and cannot support any significant weight.  The only solid wood pieces are the edges and cross beams.  Overall it's an OK piece of furniture for the price but don't be fooled by the picture, we were 
 This is a sickingly incipid "book," a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print 
 This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary! 
 Steve Albini has got to be the most sanctimonious, self-possessed, pompous [person] in the entire music industry. He emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another. He's hailed as some sort of guru by "alternative" people, when he's actually nothing but an uninformed, homophobic piece of ****. In the song "Jordan, Minnesota" he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net. Ever heard of research, Steve? Guess not, you've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment (yeah, I read the tour diary). As for the "music", this is a record by and for people who hate music 
 This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
 I thought this book was going to be more about an insightful philosophy. But instead, over half deals with Mitchell's experience as an astronaut and  his personal life. Mitchell claims to have a magic recipe - a "dyadic  model",  which is the thoughtful merger of science and spirituality. I  thought it would make an adequate inclusion of spirituality, but instead,  the author examines certain mystical phenomena and promptly claims to take  the truth from each...in his own fashion, and then retorts that such and  such people's view about the event...many of its interpretations, were  wrong. This is not a merger of science and spirituality, it is taking all  the meat from a spiritual body and just leaving the bones. This debases and  is insulting to many spiritual and cultural traditions throughout the  world. This is just a propaganda for Mitchell's own particular, quasi  atheist view of reality, and one that serves to finance his institute 
    what a transition from their earlier days.....i guess all good things must come to an end......being a fan from their beginning with their release of spit i can't believe what im hearing....i guess the title of their new release FUNERAL FOR YESTERDAY....is fitting to how i feel   i loved listening to this band, so much that i bought every disc that was released.....went to every show that they appeared when they came to new york city, even venturing out to starland ballroom when they came with otep, arch enemy.....    breathe & never again are somewhat stomachable (if thats a word but in this case it really applies to what im describing) as a "progression" as most have used with the new & improved Kittie lineup...what i don't understand is the 'tweak' of these new versions from the online ep release. these versions are much more melodic and less 'heavy'..... a couple of positives of the album are witch hunt & the change....these are the only tracks that i like and hear as a step forward for the lander sisters as evolving........im gone until they come back HARDER and bring back their oracle tenacity and spit purity.......   btw i saw them recently @ bb kings and couldn't stomach their set.......so just one ex fan's opinion.... if you like papa roach or a "heavier" version of avril lavigne then i highly recommend this cd   
 This shall be the worst book you'll ever read, if you plan on reading it. This is a poorly developed story, written very poorly, about incredibly dumb, underdeveloped and uninteresting characters. This book isn't worth the curiosity you have for it. It even manages to have numerous syntax errors, as if the author didn't even bother to proofread it, it's as if it was written by a person who've never finished high school, or passed an English class, (and if that was the kind of works the author submitted for her English class, I'm not surprised she failed and dropped out, as the biography of the author states).  Very poor work, don't waste the 10$  and the time it would take you to read 400 pages.  Read The Catcher In The Rye, it's in the same genre but leagues ahead this one, in detail, writing style, and character development.   -I know that this review might read a bit cruel, it was simply meant to be honest 
 I ordered this over two months ago - - - haven't even received it yet!  Can't review!! 
 Repetitive, boring, but sometimes effective. This set of CDs skirts around essentials, offerring too little to stand on its own as an introduction to Italian 
 I believe that 'Maximum Warp' was one of the worst Star Trek series ever written.  Firstly, the plot seemed implausible and amatuerish. The idea of dead zones just didn't work for me. And Starfleet was portrayed as a =n organisation that employed loony PR spin doctors to calm the public. Such a concept is totally contrary to the Starfleet that we all know.  Secondly, the characterisations seemed off. Picard didn't seem like the man we all know from TNG and the movies.  I read half the book, but was so disgusted with it that I stopped reading and threw it out.  That being said, I enjoyed previous Dave Galanter works. 'Battle Lines' was a fantastic Voyager book. Dave also provided an email address int hat book, and was very gracious in replying to my email. I believe that he is a talented Star Trek author, but he has missed the mark with this book. Better luck next time.  Don't waste your time on this book, but don't disregard Galanter's other works 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 I was happy with this product when I first purchased it but now I want my money back. I used the labels to put my name and contact info on photo equipment (compact flash cards, lenses, cameras) but the text faded making the labels pointless. (And on a few items the labels started coming off) It's probably fine for other uses but the labels don't last on things that are in the elements and being handled on a regular basis. I've used a   more expensive labelmaker in the past and haven't had a problem with the labels fading or coming off (and they looked nicer too). This is a classic "you get what you pay for" situation 
 I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.    My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.     Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.  Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.    So in summary the current Lexar encryption software: - Can't be used on a Windows domain machine - Can't be used on an Intel Mac - Breaks the DVD on a PPC Mac  It's not for me!  However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay. 
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
 Whatever the film's real message or satire behind this messy collection of ideas may be, `She Hate Me' is definitely a Spike Lee film. There have been common threads that run through the works that Spike Lee had done in the past, and they are deeply related to racial consciousness. It is also true he has been trying to expand his perspectives and even when he shot films like `25th Hour' you will not miss the Spike Lee touch in there.  In his `She Hate Me' you can find his unmistakable touches, for example, in the jazzy music, the (occasionally used) grainy images of 16 mm film, or frequent close-ups of the actors. You can also hear his 'voices' or messages, which are as honest and candid as the ones you heard in the 80s, but what he is trying to say remains unclear from the first to the end.  Consider this. In `She Hate Me' you will meet a gentle businessman `Jack' (brilliant Anthony Mackie) working for a big pharmaceutical company, who comes to know that the data submitted to FDA were actually rigged. He becomes a `whistle blower' but in consequence he is fired.  Then this story about corrupt business jumps to a totally unexpected stage. That is, `Jack' finds his former girlfriend waiting for him at home, who is in fact a lesbian. Knowing that Jack needs money, she offers a $10,000 deal to him, in order to have a baby - well, in fact two babies, one for her and another for her lover. Now I don't think I have to write how she gets what she wants except that there are some silly cartoon-like sequences which show how insemination occur.   Some reviewers say this film, if flawed, would be at least food for thought. Certainly there are some parts that could be intelligent commentaries on such issues as sexuality and parentage, but the film completely fails to convince us of its logical and coherent views on our society. For instance, the film warns us of the danger of being a whistle blower. Fine, but in what way does it related to the story of a man sleeping with as many as 18 ladies (including Monica Bellucci)?   But probably the biggest weakness of `She Hate Me' is its superficial descriptionf of women. See, for example, how all the `clients' of Jack (presumably lesbian) are depicted as if they are sexually aroused (and pleased) while in bed with Jack. For all his undeniable talent for tackling the social issues, Lee is not known for drawing convincing portraits of women, and I can say he has not changed much. I understand homosexuals and lesbians have their own problems, but I'm sure they would not even try to solve them in the way Lee shows unashamedly to make us laugh.  Lee managed to gather an interesting list of supporting actors including Ellen Barkin, Jim Brown, Ossie Davis, Brian Dennehy, Woody Harrelson, Bai Ling, Lonette McKee, Q-Tip, Dania Ramirez, and John Turturro. Among them, John Turturro shows again his brilliant performance which makes the flat character he plays a truly flesh-and-blood person. Surely `She Hate Me' is worth watching for the skills of the cast and crew involved in it, but they could have been used in much more efficient way with more coherent story than they are now 
 I go back to Dan Gookin's excellent DOS books.  This piece on Outlook 2003 answers almost no questions a home user of it might want.  
 Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description.  They say it is "Leather Bound".   It is most definitely NOT leather bound.  It is leatherette, which is not leather.  Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND.  I bought one and was very disappointed.  I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 A good book to leave lying around in dentist's waiting rooms, but if you actually want to concentrate on reading about Shakespeare you'll need something much more grown-up. Anyone with such a short attention-span as this book imagines its readers to suffer from would have trouble getting to the end of a Shakespeare sonnet, never mind a whole play. This book is all bright pictures and sound-bites -- it's completely facile, a series of short-cuts to the aspects of Shakespeare which for some reason people think high school students need. They probably aren't the ones you want anyway.

 This book is too boring that I have nothing to sa 
 This type of a book is not read for its entertainment value, that it obvious. The depth of the content is a primary consideration, and in the case of this book, the material is not lacking in depth, borrowing from a subject as rich and profound as the human mind itself - Buddhist phychology. However, the message of healing through mindfulness gets lost in the hopeless wandering aroung in circles, without ever really getting anywhere. Where is this book going? By page 130 it was still not very clear. This seems more like a dry psychology textbook, filled with chapter after chapter of research results, case histories and impressive technical "buzzwords", than an inspiring and sympathetic Buddhist teaching on how to heal the emotions. I peronally have found Tich Nhat Hanh's wrtitings much more "Buddhist", in a sense, because they are warm, non-technical, practical and consise. The Dalai Lama himself has written a number of excellent books on the subject 
 Rossetti outlines the destructive impact of clergy abuse on the victim, the institutional church, and the parish community. As the Executive Vice-President and COO of St. Luke Institute, one of the main US Roman Catholic clergy psychiatric facilities, the author could have provided invaluable first-hand accounts of dealing with the church hierarchy's handling of clergy who abuse, including reassignment, failure to report the abuse to civil law enforcement authorities and failure to be forthright to parish communities who may have an abuser in their midst.  Missing from the book is carefully developed insight concerning how organizations like St. Luke Institute treat clergy offenders and how impact of the abuse on victim(s) is incorporated in the treatment and how the victim/s and parish community is prepared for the clergy abuser's release from treatment. The author stands in a position of knowing directly how the archbishops and bishops respond to victims both in terms of compassion and justice and inclusion of information on those experiences would have been insightful.  Additional insight into how offending clergy are monitored upon release from institutions like St. Luke Institute would have been a relevant chapter in the book. 
 Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third.  Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen.  Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree 
 I read this in Jan. of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes.  Here goes:  Trashy, but I couldn't NOT finish it.  Story of best friends who go to a summer house every August with their families.  Secret betrayals of friendship, a hidden illness, a birth and a miscarriage.  What else do you need to make a soap-opera style plot?   I give Thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage, from envy to despair.  Bottom line: Rich people with too much money and rich people problems. It didn't stay in my short term memory very long 
 I finally gave up half way through the book. Didn't find the characters particularly interesting and the plot was too predictable 
 No, I don't own this cd.  I had the extreme misfortune of attending a party for airline employees (Daisy (my date at the time) coerced me) and you guessed it, they were playing this cd.  Unfortunately, they weren't serving drinks quickly enough and I got a good, sober listen to this one.  It's mawkish, boring, and dated.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy this cd and avoid parties where they play this kind of music 
 I'm an attorney with many years' experience in the venture capital area. The content of the book tends to reflect East Coast practice more than West Coast (Silicon Valley) practice. That's not necessarily a flaw, but you should be aware that the styles can differ in some respects.  The style of writing though, is my major complaint about this book. In a word, it's pompous. Too many sentences have very complex, passive or impersonal constructions. Paragraphs are long and dense, without any concern for the reader's fatigue level.   Also, some quantitative concepts could have been much more clearly expressed with a simple formula (high school-level math). The discussion of weighted average antidilution protection at pp. 90-91 is a case in point. I found this impossible to understand when I first read it. The more I read it, the more obscure it became to me. It could have been described much more accurately, and in many fewer lines, with a simple fraction.  Clear communication didn't seem to be a priority for this author. 
 It seems clear that much research went into this book, unfortunately with very little visible editing.  There is much tedious repetition of the same point. Extraneous information peeks out at us without elaboration. It is true that New York emerged as the center of American publishing, but why tantalize the reader with this fact by means of a single sentence in the midst of several pages about the garment industry. The treatment of the 1911 Triangle fire is far too minimal, and suggests, erroneously, that this was a solely Jewish experience.  This is most emphatically not the case, either in terms of the victims or the long term political consequences both for Jews and the Democratic party.    
 This book is probably not helpful to anyone seeking more than VERY basic social skills.  I did not find anything particularly informative.  The writing is long-winded, is generally an midly annoying, boring lecturing style.  At many points, it actually seemed as if the author was not a man, but rather, someone's wife carrying on about the commonplace, stale female gripes and frustrations about how filthy are their men. Where's the male backbone? Not here. The male author seemed to cowtow to the female of the house; it actually looks like he mirrored the concerns of various women consulted and then determined that essential manners require full male compliance.    Also, the title of the book seems misleading due to the very obvious matters discussed.  I thought this book would build an intermediate or advanced level of male manners, but most of the information is irrelevant or too basic to be helpful.   Sorry for the negative report; it was a let-down, but then again I only paid $5 for it. 
 Out of Place : A Memoir is one long whining session.  All Said does is whine and bellyache.    But then again, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine.  When given their own territory, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine  It is the Palestinians that gave the world suicide bombers, and they have the gall to complain.  Said defends those very bombers.  The ones who kill Americans.  This book is a lot of fiction.    I spoke with Eddy Said once.  He admitted the Palestinians were wrong and the Israeli's right.  But he said that any Arab who publicly admits that is a dead man.  Said had a lot of freedom in Israel.  If only the Arab states would have given them that same level of freedom. 
 Unfortunately, there seemed to be no recourse after I ordered this for 2 newphews as a Christmas gift, and it did not arrive.  I tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else (distributor?) who never responded.  So disappointing since it was a gift for someone else.  Happened not once, but twice 
 Excellent book, especially for a first time dog owner.. 
 This has to be one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read. At one point the authors ask: if money equals security, wouldn't you feel safe walking through a major American city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist? If money really did equal security, you would! I stopped reading after that.   I will say, however, that this book cured me of all of my bad financial habits. I never want to be so bad off as to look to a book like this for advice again.  
 While most reviewers seem to be bent on lauding Gloria Anzaldúa's "insightful and progressive" writings, I can't help but take a different viewpoint.  The vast majority of her essays, while cloaked in a sense of righteous equality, are quite simply racist drivel.  She speaks of acceptance and tolerance for foreign cultures in America, and harps on the evils of correcting students when they use improper English, yet instills her writing with a blatant and offensive racism.  I make specific reference to the article "How to Tame A Wild Tongue".   In her conclusion, she praises the perseverance and endurance of the mestizo race/culture, making reference to walking by "the crumbling ashes" of American civilization.  An eagerness is felt to see the day that "white laws and commerce will rot in the desert".  One would be hard pressed to come up with a more hypocritical conclusion.  Here is an author preaching tolerance and acceptance of different languages and cultures throughout her entire article.  She whines about the troubles she had fitting in with English speaking people.  She goes in depth to explain the numerous bastardizations of Spanish that are spoken in various Hispanic cultures and tries to convince us of how each is a viable language, even so-called "Spanglish", just a blend of English and Spanish that you might hear in a high school Spanish I class ("el chairo = chair,la ceilingo = ceiling, etc.) .  And after all that talk of acceptance, she ends by completely blasting American culture and expressing her wish to see it crumble to dust, while at the same time presenting the mestizo as the dominant race which will endure this fall.  Talk about racist.  I understand pride of your country and people, but this goes far beyond simple nationalism, especially in light of the overall message of the article.  Tolerance is right out the window here.  Don't be fooled by Anzaldúa's overly wordy diction and pseudo-intellectualism.  She is a flat out racist that for some reason is tolerated (forget that, praised to the roof!) in many academic circles.  Her educational philosophy is naive, irresponsible, and fundamentally flawed.  Hopefully her writings will soon fall out of the limelight 
 Although this book has a noble purpose, it gets lost in meaningless fluff and 50 cent words.  Why do authors feel the need to write books for people with degress in Literature instead of the general audience???    I guess that's why there is "Best-Selling Authors" not "Best-Writing Authors"  It was hard to read and had so much rhetoric to classical literature.  If you like reading Thesis papers, this is for you.     
 It's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film.  How could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy?   If this film is considered groundbreaking then I fear for our Republic 
   I quote from the introduction to the book: "The stories that appear in this book are those of individual people and, in one case, a composite of several..." Since when does a researcher combine individual stories to create a 'composite of several'? This important sentence questions the accuracy and validity of the stories in this book.  Why won't the author tell us which stories she considers 'individual' and which one is the 'composite'. What if the composite story is the one that is emphasized, the one that the author keeps going back to?  The book is a worthwhile read for someone like me, who lives in the hasidic community, and who is wondering whether others, too, are unhappy with so many restriction. The good thing about this book is that it mentions (if you read the notes in tiny print in the back) the existence of an organization that caters to people who are trying to leave the hasidic way of life. That organization might indeed serve an important purpose, if it is being done correctly. Young hasidic boys whose English and academic skills are poor need outside assistance and support if they want to be able to choose their own way of life.  But I would not believe the details in each story until the author clarifies. I would not suggest this as a worthwhile read for someone trying to learn about hasidim from the outside. It is too negative. Try watching 'A Life Apart'. I found the atmosphere and mood of that movie to be quite charming. It is a good starting point. There are other books out there that I have not read that cover the hasidic way of life from different viewpoints. Don't let this be the only book you read!  To read the section of the author's introduction that I referred to, simply place your mouse on the image of the book and a search box will pop up. Type in 'composite of several' and read the page that comes up.   As I read in a previous review, the author should publish her final dissertation, if it exists, the one that prompted all this research, so that we can get an accurate portrayal of these hidden lives and of how the data was collected. 
 What a waste of space.They should have hung this idiot years ago.Nowhere in the book does it reveal how the CIA programmed and brain-washed Chapman to kill John Lennon.If anything Mark David Chapman was a Christian zealot who only martyrized an aging rock star,ebbing out from the surge of the Religious Right anyway.Lennon refused to surrender his liberal radical chic associations.I have yet to read an accurate story about the senseless assassination of a musical icon.Lennon's shocking death may have been a settling of an old score because of the firing and following suicide of Brian Epstein.Planned by the CIA.-Maybe Ted Koppel could interview Chapman and show him his 'Beatles Wigs' collection?-Peace!Easy.   
 Broken Arrow was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: John Travolta and Christian Slater among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a routine stealth bomber flight over the US gone awry resulting in the theft of the two nuclear missiles it was carrying. In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The major setbacks are in relation to: 1) The brainless plot, the brainless action, and the brainless dialogues. 2) All the impossible situations that the heroes got themselves out of. 3) The Park Ranger.  First she attempts to arrest a US Air force pilot (!) instead of offering assistance and then she turns into John Rambo for the duration of the film!  She is a Park Ranger for crying out loud! As for the rating, it should have been PG-13.  Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers. No masterpiece here.   
 This story is a sequel to Tess Gerritsen's more original book 'The Surgeon.' In 'The Apprentice' she largely recaps the trauma her protagonist Jane Rizzoli had to endure during the hot summer a year ago. Passages of inner monologue are meant to captivate the reader. Unfortunately, I was not captivated by Jane Rizzoli's rather flat and not very nuanced perception of her surroundings (including her constant feminist offense by anything male). Sure, there is plenty of medical detail of the slayings and forensics; but they do not seem to lend the book any soul. The characters have almost no depth which together with the detailed procedural descriptions of techniques used to investigate crime-scene evidence leave the reader very dissatisfied.    Around pages 200-250 (of 350) the actual plot is finally revealed, and I must admit that Ms. Gerritsen had a quite clever and almost convincing idea to link the series of 'apprentice' killings to a war criminal. But too little is made of this idea. The reader learns almost nothing about the 'apprentice.' Interspersed monologues by the 'surgeon' (the bad guy from her last book who in a run-of-the-mill fashion manages to miraculously escape from a medical ward and who is meant to act as a 'teacher' to the apprentice) do not help.    I would strongly recommend you choose another book to sink your precious time into. 
 I was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library's One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually).  Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce.  This book is leaden and tedious.  I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a  book and not finish it.  But it was no labor of love.  It was simply a labor.  
 If you're familiar with the writings of Wong Kiew Kit he often states that you can't learn genuine martial arts like Taijiquan and Shaolin Kung Fu from a book.  You need to learn from a master because there are too many subtleties that will be missed without a proper instructor.  So when Wong Kiew Kit states that:   "I have no Taijiquan lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Taijiquan masters. I mainly learned from Taijiquan classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Shaolin training."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans04b/jul04-1.html  Which is similar to saying:  "I have no Shaolin lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Shaolin masters. I mainly learned from Shaolin classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Taijiquan training."  There's no way Wong Kiew Kit would tolerate someone claiming to be a master of Shaolin Kung Fu without having learned from a teacher belonging to a lineage.  On his website he states that:  "Not a single person of those who have learnt Taijiquan from me complains about my lack of a Taijiquan lineage. In fact, no one seems to care about this lineage issue. On the other hand, they are satisfied that what they have leant(sic) from me is very close to the kind of Taijiquan practiced by masters in the past."  http://wongkk.com/answers/ans02b/dec02-3.html  How are these people qualified to gauge how closely Wong Kiew Kit's Taiji compares to Taijiquan masters of the past?   Did they time travel and study under these past masters?  Or do they have a gut feeling like I have a gut feeling that I can learn Shaolin Kung Fu from a Taiji instructor?  It's quite likely that WKK is teaching a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu that uses Taiji principles gleaned from his interpretation of the classics.    I won't deny that Wong Kiew Kit is probably Shaolin master, but there's no evidence to suggest that he is teaching an authentic form of Taiji.  He has admitted that his entire knowledge of Taijiquan has mainly come from books and scriptures, not from a living breathing human being trained in a proper lineage.  Call it whatever you want to WKK, but don't mislead people into thinking its Taijiquan.  Telling people to learn from masters and not from books and then doing it yourself is completley hypocritical.    In the end, of what value is a "Tai Chi Chuan" book that was written by someone who has no real "Tai Chi Chuan" training?  In response to a new review, let me mention a few things:  One reviewer presupposes that Taiji branched off from Shaolin, but there's so much debate about the origins of Taiji its to hard to make any concrete statements about it.   The Wikipedia page on Zhang Sanfeng states that:   "Much of the written material about him is mythical, contradictory, or otherwise suspect. For instance, he is reported by different people to have been born either in 960, 1247, or in 1279."  There's almost no proof to suggest that he actually existed, or that he created Taiji out of Shaolin.  But what tends to be agreed upon is that all forms of Taiji branched off from Chen Style when Yang Lu-Chan learned the art and spread his version of Taiji (Yang Style) across China.     This reviewer and his master may have proper training in a Taiji, and I won't contest that, but as WKK explicitly states, he has none.  He seems to mistake WKK's lack of proper instruction from a Taiji master as modesty.  If  "modesty" is what you are looking for in a teacher, may I too be "modest" about my lack of proper instruction in Shaolin, and offer you my instruction; perhaps even a book about something that I have no proper instruction in.        WKK does state that you should not learn Taiji without a proper instructor, but he himself did just that.  Maybe he could provide us with the origins of his undistinguished lineage to settle the argument?    When the reviewer says that the Shaolin Temple is the "supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history," it really is just a matter of opinion.  Not everyone views the Shaolin Temple in such a holy light.  Everything WKK writes in his books about the history of martial arts, the Shaolin temple and Buddhism ends up supporting his qualifications as a teacher; which is a major conflict of interest.  All the legends about Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng are stated as fact without being prefaced with a warning about the highly mythical nature of their history.  He uses the iffy Taiji developing from Shaolin story to justify his lack of Taiji lineage.  If you were a prospective customer you would be highly discouraged by the whole no-lineage thing.  But when he feeds you the Taiji developing from Shaolin stuff the reader thinks, "If Taiji developed from Shaolin, WKK must be a Master of both."  WKK sounds pretty great if he is the one writing the history books 
 I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment 
 I was motivated to write this review (my first) because the last chapter was so bad.  The last chapter didn't flow with the rest of the book or itself.  I thought I may have slept through parts of the book, so I started to re-read it.  No, I handn't slept while reading.  I couldn't finish re-reading because, like the first time, I got tired of the rambling and griping.  In this final chapter, the author missed the obvious.  He was the problem and would have been forced to leave regardless of national and organizational leadership.  
 This cd is just so so pop to me. I think it would be enjoyable to people aged 11-37 years old. If your over 4o your better off buying a cd of Twila Paris or Keith Green(both of them sing better than Rebecca in my opinion) but Rebecca does sing songs about God which are biblical and wonderful. But I would recomend this cd for fans of Melissa Etridge and Kiss (but not for those who dislike loud hard rock 
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 This comic book is a replay of an ancient war in Greece. The director of Sin City intends to make a movie out of the books contents. Interesting read but it is over in 15-20 minutes and for the price I would take a second thought 
 The idea behind this movie is simple: get together the ugliest men and women ever assembled and force one beautiful woman to simulate sex with each of them.  The lead actress does manage (with effort) to keep a straight face while getting intimate with these gargoyles, but she doesn't manage to show any chemistry.  Who could?  If you want an erotic movie with lots of nudity, see Young Lady Chatterley, or Sexual Chemistry, or Animal Attraction, or The Ultimate Attraction.    If you're looking for a horror movie with lots of ugly people nude, you've found it. 
 On balance, this book provides a good overview of the subject and of recent academic studies.  However, it is often theoretical and "ivory-towerish."  There is relatively little that really instructs the reader about transactions are actually done.  A great deal of time is devoted to discussing why they occur, but little practical insight is provided as to the challenges and issues that must be resolved.  This book may be suitable for someone who is curious and interested in reading about M&A but provides little guidance for those interested in learning how to undertake transactions 
 i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security.  Now i regret buying one.  Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF.  everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton 
 I didn't find this funny, satirical or humourous in any way. Poor drivel and a waste of time and brain matter 
 Ulitmate Sales Letter?  I think not.  I have been in business for 27 years and did not see any thing new or exciting in this book.  So poorly written I disposed of it in the recycle bin.  Amazon was great!  
 I could barely keep my eyes open through this one. It's so theoretical and dry. There's nothing practical in this for parents. Maybe more so for the professionals. And I HATE the clumsy and awkward "he/she" all the time and all over the place. It's very distracting and highly unprofessional 
  Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.   I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel". 
 Astonishing to see Amazon promoting this anti-Israel, anti-semitic book, from an  organisation that prides itself on just those prejudices.    This book skews history, totally ignoring the 8, yes 8 times when the Arabs could have got themselves another Palestinian state, ignoring the fact that Jordan already occupies 2/3rds of the original area of Mandate Palestine allocated for a Jewish Homeland by the League of Nations in 1920.   
 This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed?  On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive?  Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this.  	 	 	 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 This book provided very little quality information. In several cases the information was either missing or incorrect. 
 101 Bulletin Board Ideas is the only item I have bought from Amazon that displeased me. It is religious in nature, yet there was no mention of that fact when I bought it. Ms. Lee's cutesy ideas are not academic in nature - there is absolutely not one academically based idea in the book - and I was not even able to give the book away, despite knowing a couple of Catholic school teachers. The book would only be helpful to those who teach pre kindergarten in a Christians only school. 1 star for the rating is still one too many 
 This book is not Hardcover as stated in the ad. The book is not for sale in the US and Canada and it is clearly marked on the cover. It's violating the Copyright Act. I gave it one star because there was anything lower than that. 
 I bought a MV2010 in October and installed a second hard drive to back up the first.  The first annoying issue was that transferring the files from an external hard drive using the USB port on the media vault was very slow....  After about 6 weeks of use, the primary hard drive went down.  I used the online support and was told to send the entire unit back for service.  After about a month of not hearing anything, I contacted the service center by phone.  Here, it took about two weeks of calls to figure out that the unit should not have been sent back and that the online service representative was not qualified to deal with the media vault in the first place.  The case was then sent to a Quality Case Manager who said that the first couple of service technicians messed the case up (duh?!) and I would be sent a new unit.  I received a new unit about a week later, but it did not contain a hard drive.  So another two calls to the service center and a drive is sent out.  I installed the drive, and surprise, it did not work!  Another call to Johnny my Quality Case Manager and I find out that the unit that was sent was refubished (perhaps a bad sign that refurbished units are available only 3 months after the unit is introduced).  Another couple of calls and I get a new unit-a full two months after sending the original unit in.  Happily this one has been working for the past 2 months--we'll see how long it lasts 
 Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs 
 You're writing a poem or song. You've got one word, and want a rhyming word. So you need a rhyming dictionary.  Look up the word you know and find other rhyming words.  How simple does it get?  Well with this dictionary - forget it.  This is arranged NOT alphabetically by word, but by vowel "sound". They have transformed what should be a simple process into a chore.  
 If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.  Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better 
 I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear...  I figured at this price, I'd try for my wife and I.  When I first tried them on, I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on.  Even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them.  Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones.  Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive.  
 Pastoralia is only a forgettable book when compared to the vast majority of works being published nowadays, but is a huge disappointment when compared with Saunders' debut novel, Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Only one short story from Pastoralia -- Sea Oak -- lives up to the Civilwarland's originative creativity. Those who build Pastorlia up into something of an esteemed work are followers of hero-worship, not followers of good satire 
 The intent of the author is good, i.e., providing a workshop for people who are learning GoF design patterns. But result is disappointing.  First of all, design pattern would lose most of its values (or at least it is hard to appreciate its value) if there is no design context and forces that constrain or influence the solution proposed by the pattern. The context and resolution of these forces will let the reader/designer the see the value of how a design pattern fits in and balances the forces and maintains a level of flexibility. However, each chapter of the book provides little context for the design challenges.  Secondly, I don't understand why the author picks fireworks industry as the background for all the examples in the book, it is an area that most people are not familiar with. I know design patterns are not domain specific and can be applied broadly, but knowing the background of the industry in the examples is definitely helpful for readers. And all those examples are very boring, and sometime ridiculous.  Thirdly, the author tries to provide some pattern refactoring examples, but does a lousy job compared with Joshua Kerievsky, the author of "Refactor to Patterns", who provides clear steps to refactor from an existing causal (bad) design to a pattern. Particularly, what are the problems of the existing design and how a design pattern will solve those problems.  Overall, I am sorry to say that the author's mission failed terribly for such a good will. 
 I bought this for my 2 year old when I saw it at the store, remebering how much I liked mine as a child & how fast I could go.  Not on this thing! It's oval instead of round so not much room for him to sit, & doesn't turn well at all.  
 I bought this CD for my two year old. Had I known that one of the songs refers to a drunken sailor who should be put away until he is sober, I would have purchased something else. I think Disney should be more careful of what they put on their CDs 
 This is the kind of book you would never buy in a bookstore. Flip through a few pages and see thin and brief "case studies," which frankly ring hollow and maybe aren't true. Advice given at the end of each chapter is flip and insulting: "develop a sense of humor" "take better care of yourself physically" and so on. Also, there are some really far-fetched points the author seems intent on making over and over chapter after chapter. Women losing estrogen can become more feminine and masculine at the same time. Same goes for men. Right. Another nonsensical point the author harps on relentlessly is that this generation has been given 30 more years to live, to 100 years old, unlike all previous generations. Clearly, that is not fact based on statistics. The worst part of this oddball book is that everyone "over 40" is relegated to the Third Age which also includes 90 and 100 year olds, so as you can imagine, lots of fighting cancer and disease issues. And, finally, way too many stories of women who left husbands in the Third Age to live with other women and find true happiness. Yuck 
 Like other users, I found the light output substandard. I bought it specifically as an emergency light source. If I really needed this light, there really would be an emergency! Absolutely pathetic 
 When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead 
 I cannot believe I bought this movie! I thought it would fit in wit the GodFather.........no way. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Seriously. I've seen a lot of bad ones, but this is Tops. I wanted to stop watching after suffering through the first 20 minutes, but I kept viewing to see if it would improve. It didn't. Do not waste the money to rent and especially buy this movie! GARBAGE 
 I see this model is no longer listed by Amazon, so I don't know how you got here. First, it was sold by J&R, not for the advertised price of $59.21, but for $69.99!! However, shipping and handling was half of what DBROTH wanted. Second, there is no light on the timer. Unreadable even with normal ambient light.  Third, the start and stop buttons are hard to find. Used the old standby, fingernail polish to highlight them. Fourth, and most serious, the Power Setting doesn't work. I have no idea what the power setting is set at. Buy a microwave or similar putchase locally. That way you can take it back and complain like hell. As for me, I will keep it because of the high cost of shipping it back, but not buy similar products from Amazon unless shipped directly from Amazon and with free shipping 
 This book, while being an, 'Introduction' is not at all that.  The author has little command of the English language and, while he does have great knowledge regarding the philosophy of logic, is unable to communicate it in  a method capable of actually introducing a beginner to the world of logic.   The Tractatus makes more sense than this maze of jargon 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 In general this is an informative book of ideas IF you are planning on a very hi-tech / upper-class / expensive restaurant. Definately not for the small business entrepreneur wishing to gather ideas for a small intimate casual gathering place 
 This book starts off with an interesting story line with a ton of potential and then goes progressively downhill! The minute C.J. steps through the stage door into the past, the author seems to lose control of her own story.  My biggest problem with this book is the characterization of the Darcy character - known as Darlington in this story. Once again, one of the most dashing and romantic characters in all of literature is reduced to a 'very expericed' man fulfilling someone's very graphic sexual fantasy. Yuck!! That is a great disservice to both Jane Austen and Darcy. 
 Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre.  The killer's "twist" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing.   Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them 
 I found that this book was not very helpful and it is outdated 
 Julianne Moore, as the desperate mother whose car was carjacked with her son in the back seat, was totally, completely unbelievable in the role. Not a scene or inch of dialogue rang true, and her acting was incredibly sub-par and annoying to the point of ruining the movie. Jackson does his usual great work, but her performance, the unrealistic scenarios of police 'procedure,' and the choppy direction did the movie in. Pretty darn bad... 
 First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments. 
 I am not any kind of sanskrit scholar but I have enjoyed reading mythological literature for about ten years and I found Buck's Mahabharata to be a bore. I found it incomprehensible and disjointed. It was as if the author was trying really hard to create such an air of enchantment that he gave us something that sounded downright obscure and pretentious. At first I thought that maybe the original is this way, but then I came across R.K.Narayan's crystal clear version. After that I read Rajagopalachari's, which was beautiful. I recommend these versions much more 
 Well this was a letdown.  After the first two LT albums, I couldn't wait for the new album to come out.  Honestly, I wish I was still waiting.  Luca Turilli is one of the greatest guitarist of this generation--yet you'll find none of that here. In fact there are hardly any guitars present.  Now some may say "He just wants another Rhapsody album."  No, I wanted a LT album!!!  One that rocks hard and fast.  Well, this ain't it.   The music is just not enjoyable.   now to the songs.  The first thing you notice upon listening to the entire album is there is just way too much of the girl vocals, it's almost every song!  The entire first half of the album is forgettable.  It does pick up in the later half, but it's a struggle.  Song #9 is by far the best song.  The singers seem into it and it rocks. I think it all comes down to urgency.  There's nothing here that makes you want to listen to this album.  While every song starts-off sweet, it falls apart where it seems the singers are just going through the motions, no real passion.   After listening to it, I had to throw something else on, to get the bad sounds out of my ears.  Thank God for the new Lordi cd 'the Arockalypse'--that will help me forget this 
 The hair dryer is very heavy.  Also, while I like the yellow design of the dryer itself, the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 I thought this book was going to interact exegetically with the texts that each system uses to establish itself. At least as far as the central three chapters go, on that score, this is a disappointing book. The author starts his overview of dispensational theology with the same tired arguments (posed and answered many times before) over the origins of dispensationalism along with the (apparently) obligatory derogatory language ridiculing dispensationalism. (In the culture at large, it seems the only people one can deride without fear of being called intollerant are evangelical Christians; simply deriding them/us is somehow a means to establish oneself as superior. Among evangelical scholars this role [mock-able and dismiss-able] is assigned to dispensationalists). (He apparently got some of his material from B. Rossing's really mean, poorly researched and really bad attack piece "Rapture Exposed." Please! can we just leave C. I. Scofield's undocumented past out of the discussion? How is this "testing" the exegetical foundations?) The author demonstrates a serious ignorance of dispensational theology when he claims that Matthew 24: 36-41 (p. 112) is "of course" a "favorite text to prove the rapture." Simply false; that text is about the Second Coming and no reputable dispensationalist I know claims otherwise. He conflates texts that speak of the rapture (1 Thess 4) with texts that speak of the Second Coming without a single reference to the dispensational arguments that keep such texts separate. It boils down to Witherington's assertions as to the meaning of 1 Thess 4, 5 and Matthew 24 set next to inaccurate and inadequate summaries (by Witherington) of what dispensationalists teach (see the summary list on p. 109). His discussion of the nature of prophecy is largely irrelevant to a critique of dispensationalism since many of the points he makes could be and are made by dispensational exegetes.  His overview of Romans 9-11 is not really a critique of dispensationalism, so much as his contribution to the very crowded boat-load of Romans commentators; some more some less amenable to dispensationalism. Yes, there are implications for dispensationalists given the author's take on Romans 9-11 but Witherington's view casts a shadow over many alternate interpretations and is by no means the most sound (see Moo, Romans: NICNT, among others). If you are a non-dispensationalist looking for a fair overview of the system this book is clearly not it. 
 well i'll explain that later. she uses her own vocals. she doesn't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.I love how the editoral review uses the term "unique vocal TALENT". Yoko has no vocal talents. I must also point out I am Courtney Love's number one fan, so this should give me even more cred.   It just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she won't let other artists do an album using their own vox. She loves the sound of her own too much!  I already went through that stage where I made everyone listen her as a joke. I was about 14 then. My point here, this isn't even a good joke.   Its just dumb.  I listened to the song clips provided on amazon. even that was too much.  if you must, just download this album for free. Do not buy it. Do not in any way support this woman.   I wish there was a zero star rating. 
 When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't. This book is for people that know some Tagalog. It was very hard to use for learning the language. Not a good book for beginners 
 Is Edell anything more or less than a 19th century huckster peddling the latest fads cloaked in the jargon of medical science?  A resounding NO!  Only this time around he is not making the rounds in a horse and buggy but on America's airwaves.  His "bag" consists of criticizing  others' opinions that do not fit into his laissez faire worldview:  sex is good, eat drink and be merry is good, and your doctor is not as good as I am - bunk.  Dangerous stuff.. 
 there were almost 20 pages missing  on both chapters 8 and 9 this is very disappointing.. 
 Camelot was a Broadway hit in 1960 and defined the era when John F Kennedy was president.  Its original Broadway cast was the stuff of legend:  Richard Burton as Arthur, Julie Andrews as his queen, Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as the dashing Sir Lancelot.  With a score by Lerner and Loewe it remains a musical treasure that is often revived.  In 1967, Warner Bros released the film version.  The result was one of the most disappointing adaptations of all time, a long, long, long film that is difficult to watch through in one sitting.  Much of the blame for this must be given to director Joshua Logan who made few films and helped botch another screen adaptation of a classic Broadway musical when he made the film version of "South Pacific."  The casting of the film was also lacklustre.  Richard Harris comes off best as Arthur though he's no Burton.  Burton would have been too old to play the role on film but his greatness as a film and stage actor is something that can not be denied and he remains in a class apart from Harris.  Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere is for me a disappointment.  I find it hard to imagine her as a queen at all for she lacks the regal bearing and elegance needed to play this queen of legend.  Her singing is acceptable given you have never heard Julie in this score.  Julie brought the right amount of natural elegance to the role while still being mischievous, flirtatious and sly when needed before becoming a woman who creates a major problem for herself by loving two men.  Her singing of "The Simple Joys Of Maidenhood" and "The Lusty Month Of May" are comic and vocal delights while "I Loved You Once In Silence" is heartbreaking.  Redgrave does not come close in matching Julie's talent as singer and actress.  Franco Nero is a handsome Lancelot but it's hard in 2006 to accept movies where the actor's singing has been dubbed as his is for this film.  My advice:  if you have an afternoon and evening to kill watch this but be warned it's pretty hard going.  If you want to hear this classic score at its best try the Broadway cast recording.  There are also excerpts that were filmed for "The Ed Sullivan Show" back in 1960 with the original cast that are available on DVD.  They give an inkling into what this film might have been like with the right director and cast 
 This is an anemic collection of Jimmy Dean's Hits.  The copy I purchased online is made by Bear Family Records which cost [quite a bit] for the CD, however, it contains a total of 26 songs like "Gotta Travel On", Please Pass The Biscuits, Walk on Boy, Make The Water Wheel Rol, Dear Ivan, Sixteen Tons, and others.  Now, here's the real kicker -- The label of the CD is made to look like a (circa 1950s) 45-RPM single with the dark red label with gold lettering and even has the record grooves including the runout groove used to trip the changer mechanism.  Where the "Columbia name would be is the name "BEAR FAMILY".  Bear Family Records also did a Guy Mitchell CD and duplicated the late 50s Columbia label look with the red & black squares.  Bear Family Records cost a little more but they really do a pro job with no skimping.  This CD is a BIG disappointment, they could have done better. In fact they SHOULD HAVE done better 
 I really wanted to like this novel.  It had a clever name, an amalgamation of the Great Schism that separate Catholicism and Protestantism, and Matrix, like the movie with the same title.  (Note: the novel is pronounced Shiz-mat-rix, with a short a, rhymes with schematics).  A classic cyberpunk title.  However, this novel is anything but user-friendly.  I don't know if pharmaceuticals are needed for appreciating this novel, or if the author used them when frantically writing, in between vacuuming the roof of his house and such.  The novel moves at such a frantic pace that within one sentence the entire setting can change and this happens more than a few times.  It's difficult to know the point of the plot; perhaps that life is worth living.  The novel is a cross between Heinlein's Time Enough For Love, Bester's The Stars My Destination, and petting a sea urchin.  In a shocking act of consideration, the publishers have included all of Sterling stories related to the Shaper-Mechanist War.  That would be the full length novel, plus five stories.  The stories were written before the novel, which was the order I read them in, although after reading the novel last, I can't say whether or not to recommend reading in that order.  The stories are interesting and enjoyable.  In fact Sterling seems to excel with his short stories.  His story "Flowers of Edo" is where I got interested in his style.  I would recommend his short stories, but this novel is another matter.  Humanity has balkanized into a number of factions, with the Shapers and Mechanists being the most powerful.  The Shapers have reshaped their bodies genetically.  This includes such drastic things as replacing all the E. Coli in their intestines with enzymes.  The Mechanists are like the Borg of Star Trek, they use mechanical prosthetics to enhance themselves.  If you think the Mechanists are the cleaner of the two, think again.  Cockroaches and bacteria are prevalent in Mechanist environments.  Every five years the Mechanists need to have the bacterial growth scraped and UV-burned off their skin.  That's one thing prevalent throughout his writings, this sort of creepiness.  Expect more of it.  However, don't let the war make you think this is some majestic good vs. evil epic space war.  Battles are mostly low key.  There is lot's of narration and dialog.  Sterling self-claims his crammed prose.  No kidding.  Adjectives rule supreme in this novel; as many as possible are crammed into each sentence.  If one would do a histogram of adjectives, this novel would be on the far right tail of the bell curve.  Here's an excerpt: " He always wore his spacesuit, [something something], and [multiple length modifiers] body odor came through its [multiple adjectives] collar with [multiple adjectives] pungency."  Sentences like this go on and on and on and on and on and on and on throughout the novel.  And there's no shortage of hyphenated words, like long-fermented, eye-watering.  On one page, there were no less than 11 hyphenated words, plus one triple one.  Similar to the prosthetics of the Borg, the sentences themselves seem interchangeable.  Here's another excerpt of a dialogue: "What was your brigade? I'm no Cataclyst. I have your weapon here. Constantine pulled a ... vial from his ... jacket ..." You may as well interchange your own sentences: `The tree fell in the forest; it made no sound' or `the space ship went into orbit; it's boots were muddy.'  Give it a try. It'll make as much sense.  There are times when the novel seems profound.  I would find myself backtracking at times to understand some point, and I would go back 5, then 10, then 20 pages to try to understand something and would just give up and go back to where I was.  It's hard to say you read this novel, it's more like your eyes glance over the words, and on occasion you absorb some of it.  Since the novel fluctuates from the profound to the mundane an average of 2-1/2 stars seemed appropriate 
 i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag 
 Like the heading says, this case barely fits on my new Gen 80 gig iPods, bulging at the seams and not totally covering the unit. I don't know what iPod this does fit well, but on mine, after literally hours of fiddling, it still is misshapen and awful. Nice clear cover over the screen, shame about the fit 
 I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players.  An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants.  Hearing about a bunch of middle aged and old guys sitting around eating chow mein and idolizing Red is not very entertaining.    I have no doubt that all of Red's adventures in the NBA would make a fantastic book.  Unfortunately, this is not that book. 
 I love history.  I love Biblical history. It seemed as if the illustrator had a "proverbial gun to their head" to get all the text into "X" amount of pages -- thereby printing it every "which way" in order to accomplish this feat. It wasn't "cute" nor CLEAVER having to read spirals -- in a book that has so much GOOD INFORMATION -- that NOVELTY need not be included!!!  Due to this need for attention -- my score for this book which had been a five star rating did a nose-dive down to one star.  I went to a librarian's meet, where this was a "must read" and in the discussion attended by 30+ librarians, they indicated the "same thought!"  (If there is ever a) next edition -- think twice! 
 Don't waste your time.  There are three different books with the same photo by different publishers.  They are all ripoffs. Try Chris Warner's "A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football".  It's much better than this filler book 
 Black Sabbath?......I don't think so. If you want to hear a band that is good at copying Black Sabbath guitar listen to the Melvins. The unique thing about Sabbath was they had everything,good vocals, great guitar, good bass and good drumming.This band does not have 3 out of 4 of these qualities. The guitar is just ok. Definetly no originality.You have to be high to understand the vocals. Sounds like he's singing in another room. Not cool 
 The good thing first: Classical baby has very nice animations and the music choosen is nice too. BUT, it is very short and it does not contain any extras, there is just the animations nothing more. The package says something about a parents guide but thats just a small booklet inside thats really just an advertisement. I was hoping that some real instruments appear and people showing how to play them, as an extra this would be very useful. Well, I am disappointed by this DVD! And my kids (4 y. and 17 m.) too, they looked it one time - nearly, and dont want it any more 
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 I purchased this movie because it said that those who purchased Love's Enduring Promise also purchased this movie.  Was I ever disappointed.  I was not prepared for the content of them sleeping together before being married.  I had purchased this for my 14 year old daughter.  She also was very disappointed.  I replaced her Christmas present with another, more appropriate movie and I am distroying this movie so that no one in my home will ever have the opportunity to view it again 
 Theres just too much unecessary material in this book about ways to read in data etc. Its all unecessary cos like myself most professional  analysts and statisticians have access to SAS enterprise guide, which is incredibly powerful and so much less time consuming. The programming language is only useful for algorithms these days, as most professionals havent got the time to be debugging code all day. The text covers nothing about cluster analysis either which is central to a lot of multi variate analysis.  The mathematics and statistical detail is of far more interest and importance to us in the working environment than reading in of files. 
 This movie is entirely in Swedish with English subtitles.  It is incorrectly listed as havng an English audio track.  
 Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           "Charlotte Temple" was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now "Charlotte Temple" has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition.          Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's "Evelina" or "Camilla," Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting "dishonorable" against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall.  Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it.           Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte "elopement."          Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading 
 i was disapoint with this cd-it's style of kate bus 
 Lisa Gardner set up a great premise and wheezed the book to an improbable end.  There is enormous promise in the primary story:  what would keep a family on the run for more than a decade?  Yet I found the end contrived.  Given that this is a suspense novel, I don't want to say much, but I will say I have enjoyed Gardner's other books more 
 This book on tape was published early 2001 just in time for listeners to lose a ton in the 2001-2002 stock bust. Almost every investor lost money on stocks then, but a listener following the advice in this book on tape would have lost much more, with some tech stocks never recovering (because of bankruptcy).  Some of the advice is quite good, but about 25% is downright wrong and dangerous. If you know enough to know which advice is good and which is bad, then you don't need this book.  Perhaps something went wrong when abridging the longer written text to produce these audio tapes. In any event, if you still want to give it a shot, or if you just love the Motley Fool, then look for something by the Gardner brothers that's newer and/or not so abridged 
 Do not, do not purchase this movie.  I just finished seeing it for the first time recently, and I can say hands down that this was far and away the worst movie that Steven Seagal has ever made.  Although I am not a prude, the language was disgusting with Mother F***** this and Mother F****** that every 10 seconds.  The plot went nowhere and it was filled with  unnecessary violence.  Most of his old movies went somewhere, but this one was one violence, bad language filled scene after scene after scene.  If you liked the old Steven Seagal movies, you won't like this one 
 Order was shipped very quickly.I will keep Item. Advertised hanging hardware and swivel not included. Chair could easily fray, cotten ends are only taped, not knotted. No way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised. I should have read advertisement closer. I could have gotten 100% cotten chair for less. This ad didn't state the material used. I could buy from this company again I'll just pay closer attention 
 Do you have expensive tastes?  Are you rich?  Childless?  If so, then this cookbook is for you!  I've never even heard of some of these ingredients and the ones that weren't too expensive are nothing that my kids would eat.  In fact, I couldn't find a single thing that my kids would eat, and I don't think the average kid would either.  I think most of these recipes are something only an adult would appreciate.  Well, I guess I can't say that my kids wouldn't like ANYTHING out of this book.  They'd probably like a couple of the dessert recipes.  Check this out from your local library first.  I'm glad I did 
 How sad to see such a great actor such as Basil Rathbone in this crap after all his great films of the thirties,maybe it was personal financial troubles that forced him to accept his role in this movie that is so bad that it makes Plan 9 look acceptable 
 I loved Jack Whytes first 2 books. This was horrible. I majored in journalism and creative writing and this book seemed almost as if it was written by someone else....perhaps a 15 y.o. who's been spending too many hours pouring through Penthouse. Anyway, what a disappointment. I was ready to recommend this series to my son but cannot now. I also notice some other negative reviews that have been submitted, (which I should have heeded) have been removed so buyer beware. Perhaps Amazon is removing negative reviews to sell more of this garbage. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Someone once said, "I never read a book by a woman with three names."  I wish I had heeded his advice with this one.  It's an "O, golly, look at me, I'm a writer so what I do must be interesting."  The author takes off for travels across the country in a replica of a 1927 Bugatti with a Volkswagen engine.  What she thinks makes this noteworthy is that the car has no top!    Now, I could see writing about walking across the continent, riding a horse, driving a buggy, bicycling, on a unicycle, in a canoe (yes, it's been done), or hopping on one foot, but to think there is something unique about driving a car without a top...  Well, come to think of it it *is* unique--and stupid.    The places along the road that she finds worth writing about aren't all that interesting, although she tries to make them so with her "O, golly, gee whizz, I'm writing about it and I got here in my inadequate vehicle so you must want to read it" style.  Skip this one.  Spend your money on Steinbeck's "Travels with Charlie" or Half Moon's "Blue Highways. 
 ....This new one is not really an encyclopedia. Instead ofcompletely alphabetical it is alphabetical by subject, i.e.,chemistry, botony, etc., and made topics very hard to find.  The 2000version also left out definitions/explanations.... I don'trecommend the 2000 version at all.  Sorry.  As usual the second remakeof something never seems to be as good as the first.  EN 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 Narrated by the adolescent Will Tweedy, this story recounts the scandal of a family in small-town Georgia around 1905 when grandma dies and - a mere three weeks later - grandpa marries a much younger woman. The story follows the family drama, Will's growing up, and lots of cute or funny anecdotes along the way.  For the most part, I didn't enjoy or like this book. Too many major characters are image-obsessed (what will the town think of this? and of that?) and judgmental. While this may be "how things really were," that still doesn't make it fun to read. Some of the characters are endearing, but the others really wore me down. The book also feels like it's too slow. I listened to the unabridged audiobook (narrated by Tom Parker), and while Parker gives excellent voices to the characters, audiobooks inherently slow down the reading. So if the book is already relaxed, the audiobook puts it on sedatives. And at the end of the book, one key event (not the _final_ key event) seems emotionally manipulative: a tragic event happening to a minor character pulls heartstrings while simultaneously feeling like it doesn't quite fit.  In the book's defense, I will grant that one story in the book (involving a Christmas play) made me laugh out loud, and several sections built temporary interest. It started to win me over in the last few pages, but it was too late.  In his strange book Timequake, Kurt Vonnegut jokes that in short stories, characters have to do at least two of the following three things in order to satisfy a general public: someone changes, someone learns from their mistakes, or someone apologizes. This being a full-blown novel, Burns includes all three. But I still wasn't satisfied 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 We had this less than 10 months and used only two of three Ultimate filters we purchased separately, that's how little use this pitcher got. Started leaking everywhere one day and I couldn't figure out what had happened. I thought I hadn't put the innards back in right, after changing the filter, but in the end I decided either a seal or a seam failed.   I'm not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use, so I believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw. What a waste of a good $60, with the additional three filters purchased.  While it worked, we loved its sleek design, how much water it held and how great the water tasted. That's why it gets the two stars I gave it. Too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk.  I see the item is now not available here at Amazon and I guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation.   What I want to know is when we will be notified by Pur about the problem, and given coupons or rebates because of it; if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason Pur couldn't offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item.   Mine's now in the trash where it belongs. Don't buy one if you are considering it. Go with a good quality, faucet-mounted or under-sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did, despite the more expensive price 
 last week I bought elastic girl and jack jack to my 3 year old daughter from italy as a gift and came back to turkey.it broke that day.she doesn't have an arm anymore and can not replace it.helen can not even hold jack jack and my daughter is very upset...... 
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 i got 2 bottles it does not work and was a waste of money.  cat attract cat litter works better 
 If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it 
 Yes, this book is of historical interest, in the same sort of shameful way that lobotomies are of historical interest.  Bettelheim's success rate was mostly fabricated.  There is good evidence that he abused the troubled children in his care.  (See, for example, the evidence in "The Creation of Dr. B" by Richard Pollack).  Primarily he was a charlatan, able to pull the wool over the public's eyes in large part because he practiced in the fuzzy field of psychoanalysis, with its near absence of scientific rigors.  The book is evidently lots of fun for people who have never had to deal with real mental illness.  It's appallingly cruel to parents of autistic children, particularly the mothers. 
      This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad.     Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set 
 I love Disneyland lore, legends, facts, fiction, even rumor.  Thus, it's easy for me to delve into a tome which will dabble in some, if not all of the above.  As other reviewers have noted, some of the tidbits of information in this book are terrific fun.  But, alas, my wife is due some sleep as she was awakened by my frequent, "ARRRGH", "OH! MY GOD!", and "WHO EDITED THIS?!"      I suppose, Dear Reader, you're getting the point; the writer may have the research down, but needs to exercise her editing and spelling chops.  I believe there is some manner of a "...for Dummies" book that may help, tho im not shur wich won 
 I wanted to like this bar because it's high in protein and fiber, but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars (31g!). It's much too sweet. If they took away some of the sugar, it might be edible. 
 Very poor FM reception spoiled an otherwise fine product.  AM reception is good.  Product design is good.  I tried several different sets of earbuds and earphones, and could not get the two FM stations that I listen to most often.  Very disappointing 
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 This WOULD be a great space-saver . . . but now that Gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars, we never used it AT ALL!!  Now Gerber makes their own Feeding Center to accommodate their tubs, and I LOVE it 
 I picked up this book because I thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids.  They enjoyed "The Animal Farm" a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals.  But I guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer.  This ones almost downright depressing.  Plus theres sex!  Good thing I read ahead a little bit or I would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure.  I guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80's but it wont fly in 2006 I tell you what.    Why is there no option for ZERO STARS?!?  Oh well ONE STAR for you then Mr. Orwell 
 As a garden variety moderate, I take issue with a public servant betraying the people's trust by appointing a chronie to a vital (security) position in his administration, and then using the fallout to advance his own celebrity. McGreevey is NOT a poster boy for social tolerance, but a shameless opportunist. He is no better than our current US President, who appointed a horse trader to head Fema after 911, or countless others in government who keep the machinery of public service cluttered with their drinking buddies. It's disappointing that the concept of shame has eroded to the degree that a man could undermine our security by appointing his lover as homeland security advisor, then attempt to enhance his celebrity - not to mention his bank account -  through the subsequent revelations about his personal life. McGreevey should crawl under a rock and stay there along with every other narcissist politico 
 there's nothing you can tell clearly about this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid, and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world, maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk? i don't have any clue, man 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I tutor and this is the worst Geometry textbook I've had to use. Geometry is a new branch of mathematics to most students and can be difficult to comprehend. This book only makes it worse. The lack of examples and clear explanation is very frustrating. I empathize with any student forced to endure this text 
 At least that's what my wife said after seeing Sass on the Canadian Idol final. I'd have to agree. Sass is a buttsmack, worse yet a squalling buttsmack who can't hold a tune. Lay off the smokes Sass!!!  By the way, some may say my cat makes better music hacking up a hairball. That's the truth!!! 
 Veronica contains little action.  The story is more "recited" than told.  The book's heroine actually had an interesting story to tell, but the writing made it boring.  
 The title of this book is a bit mis-leading. Many of the recipes call for many, many ingredients and the prep time is off. For example, one recipe says 20 min. prep time. But after you read it, it says to put something in the fridge for several hours. Making a lifestyle change like the Zone is hard enough without adding the frustration of buying sooo many ingredients and putting together complicated recipes. Plus, chicken and Salmon are about the only ingredients as meats. Where's pork or turkey 
 In this meandering attempt to create a generalized theory of the meme the author piles his speculations and theories high. In the end the reader is left entirely convinced -- that there's no such thing as a meme outside of the world of metaphor 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product... This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords, ratchet tie-downs, etc.  This was a complete and total waste of money - AND damaged my bike.  On top of all that, it is NOT an inexpensive rack!  Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack.. 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
   This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word "book" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)   So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book.    
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 In a table of cable types early in the book, he lists cat 3 but not cat 5.  Otherwise, has a surprising amount of useful information, presented in a sometimes disorganized way 
 If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess.  
 If one was prone to purchase Cliff Notes in college to avoid reading the whole book, then this book may have been written for you.  It lacks detail and covers a purported 19-year history in 96 pages (which is more like 86).  I am still reading the book, but am very disappointed in its overall content and depth.  It appears to be slanted towards a one-sided view from the author's perspective and opinions.  Parts are poorly written and several misspellings.  If you are not of the Vietnam generation and want to get a full understanding of the Vietnam era, then I recommend that your money be spent on a more thoroughly written history.  However, it is published on quality paper, and the photos and maps are of excellent quality.    
 Not worth the money I sepnt on it should have been a $1.00 or .50 read it in 20 min. Very uninpressed 
 Several years ago, I heard Mr. Weihenmayer give a motivational speech and he seemed like a very interesting guy. I picked this book up because I thought it might a continuation of his "Touch The Top Of The World" book, which I thought was pretty well done. I've worked with blind skiers before. I've also done a bit of climbing (not anything close to world class peaks)so the double connections (blind people doing hard things and climbing) attracted me. So...I bought the book. Apparently, Mr. Weihenmayer got hooked up somehow with those who are selling a "theory" about adversity (the AQ). That was a mistake my climbing friend! The whole AQ thing is really pretty silly. It's not a theory at all---just a string of homespun homilies designed to(try to) help others deal with what life brings and, of course, hopefully sell books and speeches. To call it "landmark research" or even plain old research is simply not true. There are a good number of interesting and helpful self-help books out there. Some of them are direct and honest---the author or authors simply suggest that they believe certain things to be true and they are writing them down for everyone's consideration. Others are actually real science...the author or authors of those books are careful in their claims and objective in approach. Nothing is being "sold" in those books. This book, however, mixes those two things up and pop psychology is presented as science. Not a good approach!!!!!! 
 you will get nothing out of this. don't waste your money, especially at these prices. there's basically nothing here 
 There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media.   But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican.   Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?  I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this).   He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?  This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess.   Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts 
 I was disappointed with this book. Its not really very good for beginners. The patterns are kind of ugly and the instruction are not well defined and only about a paragraph long. I wont be tackling these patterns for a while. The description said this book is good for beginners but I have to disagree, unless you have a little experience behind you, you wont do so well with the instructions. I think people who have some experience will do fine with this book though. 
 The publishers should be sued. Maybe we should get a class-action together.  Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. This book is doing EXACTLY that!  Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. The author's website vanished years ago. In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. Game over.  [... 
 I AM ABOUT TO FINISH THE AUDIO VERSION OF BLOWFLY, I HAVE STUCK WITH IT, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I AM NO QUITTER.  THIS BOOK HAS BEEN VERY DISSAPOINTING UNLESS YOU HATE GOD, AND LIKE TOTAL DISFUNCTION AROUND YOU!  THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BOOK IS HORRIFIC AND UNNECESSARY!  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO BORING, WITH KAY S. BEING PERFECT AND YET ANOTHER PSYCHOPATH WANTING TO OWN HER?  HOW ABOUT A NEW PLOT??? LUCY IS UNREALISTIC AND OVER THE TOP, AND THE IDEA THAT BENTON WOULD STAY UNDERCOVER AND LET EVERYONE THINK HE IS DEAD FOR 6+ YEARS, NOT LIKELY!! ITS JUST A LAME PLOT, LAME CHARACTERS AND I WONT BE READING ANYMORE KAY SCARPETTA BOOKS UNTIL THE AUTHOR GETS BACK TO THE WAY THEY USED TO BE WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED WITH KAY S., WITH REAL BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS!! 
      Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.      The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland.  It has no discernable central thought.  No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing.  But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.      Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes?  Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see.  In reality, there was nothing there at all.  Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.      When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity.  It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.      "Press on," the professors say, "Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities."      However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness.  The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.      The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it.  Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read.  Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed.  Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.      One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's.  Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine.  This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now.  To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.      But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition?  I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend.  That is; to trust one's educated common sense.  If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.      If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson.  Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted.  And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses.     
 DualDisc will not play in mid to high end players.  While I could get the DVD side to mostly play, the "CD" did not work at all.  To find out what the problem was I went to the Onkyo web site.  Their players do not support this format since the "CD" side is not actually a CD (accorning to Philips).  So if you play this disc and it ruins your player, the player's warrenty is void since this disc is not a supported format.  Beware!  Oh, what music I did hear on the 5.1 side was quite impressive 
 I bought this book with high hopes having read the reviews here on Amazon but was sorely dissapointed with the book. Having read it cover to cover and nearly becoming comatose from doing so I have to say its not worth the money. The main reasons for saying this are: 1. It takes forever to get anywhere - I was half way through the book before anything diet and exercise related was brought up. 2. The first half of the book deals with getting in touch with your feelings. He talks a lot about learning to accept your body and miraculously you'll discover a way to lose weight. My arguement with that is if I hadn't accepted that I need to lose weight then why on earth would I be reading the book in the first place? 3. His style of writing felt condescending towards the reader, I felt like I was being told that I was a special little girl who just needed guidance in a big bad world. 4. The support network that he suggests signing up to on his website costs money from what I could tell by looking at the site. I don't know if I was reading the information on the site incorrectly - which now deals with his "new" diet anyway. 5. Having tried out the exercises in the book and followed the very basic diets plans (the kind of thing I learnt about basic food types, carbs, fats, proteins when in grade school) I've not felt any different or lost any weight. The exercises seems to be so low impact that I would have to do them constantly for several hours to work up any kind of sweat or improve my fitness/weight loss. 6. The title of the book is misleading. While yes, the exercises only take 8 minutes to do he forgets to mention the time for warming up/stretching and the writing and notes that you're supposed to make to get in touch with your inner whatever it is you're trying to reach. Overall I felt that this book was definately not worth the money. I'd rather pay for something that told me something useful within the first half of the book. However I would say that he does provide some interesting information on the metabolism. In fact I think I've burnt more calories and lost more weight by typing this review than I lost while following the book/plan for 5 weeks. In short, don't bother with this diet plan.  
 Were a plumber or an an auto mechanic to look for supernatural causes behind a pipe clog or engine problem, you might think his skills questionable.  But according to this book, if a biologist is not willing to accept supernatural causes for the origin of species, he is imposing anti-religious views on the rest of us.  As with most conservative thinkers, Johnson seems intent on splitting the country into two halves.  Those who think like him are good and believe in God, those who do not are atheists who believe in evolution.  While this has worked well for conservatives on political issues, it is less effective in this case since it is rather clear that many if not most of the scientists supporting evolution are Christians, not atheists as Johnson insists.  It is one of many lapses in this poorly written and overrated book.  His contention that the US is a Christian country which at best tolerates other religious viewpoints suggests that he looks on the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion as simply a suggestion.  It also has nothing to do with evolutionary theory and everything to do with the author's own prejudices.  Johnson feels that any unexplained gap in evolution supports the theory of an intelligent designer by default.  For Johnson, if the theory of evolution cannot shed like on everything instantly, it sheds light on nothing.  The author feels that as a Christian it is inappropriate to tolerate any suggestion of a natural explanation for creation of the universe, creation of the earth, or the creation of man.  Johnson's view seems to be that certain things related to Christian theology should be off limits to ANY sort of scientific examination.  In spite of the failings of the author, the publisher has presented the book well.  The physical quality is quite good and belies the sloppiness of the writing.  I am not sure if this is the best place to get an understanding of the thinking behind the anti-evolution movement but I think it is a good place to start.  I suspect the muddled and misguided presentation of the author is endemic to this type of book.  It is also an outgrowth of the book's basic conceit, that a lawyer can provide objective insights into science.  In fact, scientists may pretend to objectivity but lawyers specialize in advocacy and this book presents a lawyer at his worst.  He misreads evolutionary theory as meaningless.  In fact it provides a predictive model.  Organisms are the sum total of both ancestral characteristics and those variations which permit the organism to function and survive within its environment. It is a fundamental point that gives the theory its strength, something which Johnson either does not understand or choses to ignore.  Unfortunately, there is no voice to correct him.  If Johnson proves anything, it is that when he is permitted to provide the defense, he can win any prosecution.  Putting a dead man on trial with no voice raised in his defense: this must be an attorney's dream come true 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 Pojman teaches at the Military Academy at West Point, and is a known proponet of the death penalty; that's not why Om giving him a bad review.  This might not even distress you, but getting ethics from west point seems to me like getting Gay and Lesbian studies from Brigham Young.    Authors like Nieziche, John Stuart Mill, and Ayn Rand will start off a chapter, only to be immediately refuted by someone like Phillip Hallie or Jean Bethke Elshtain who make anyone remotely relativist, egoist, utilitarian seem like some sort of heartless monster.  These obscure types all seem to have failed comp.  Granted, I'm no fan of Niziche or Rand, but the entire voice of the volume (not to mention the several essays Pojman writes himself) seems self-referential and absolutist.  Pojman claims that "parents would abandon or abuse their children and spouses abandon each other whenever it was convenient...commitment, loyalty, fidelity all...are moral notions." (39); animals have no morality, and, yet, they protect their offspring.   Pojman seems to believe that on our own, we humans will not only sink down to the level of animals, but below the level of animals; not even Hobbes will believe that.  The first work of literature is Lord of the Flies, and it seems to set the tone for the entire chapter.  Literature like Sophie's choice and a narrow sliver from The Brother's Karamozov seems to lean toward the sensationalist rather than the insightful, while the philosophical essays, as always, reduce human nature down to its most absurd situations.  This volume is edited in such a way, that it presents an untrusting view of humanity, and an even less trusting view of society.  In my opinion, there's too much urgency and not enough scholarship for this book to serve me well.  My ethics professor says he thinks Pojman makes a good foil; at 68 bucks, that's one expensive foil 
 This book is really hard to read ... almost as if it was a bad photocopy.  Seek out a different ISBN on the same topic 
 As biographies of interesting people go, especially for a guy as colorful and gutsy as Bernard Kerrick, this book is disappointingly BORING.  The book is poorly written, with an over-emphasis on Kerrick's childhood and alcoholic/prostitute mother who was murdered after he was taken from her custody. The book becomes mildly engaging in the chapters where Kerrick takes over running Rykers Island and subsequently the NYPD, but the book waits far too long before bringing us up to modern events.  Another strong criticism is Kerrick's persistance in constantly singling out NYPD officers by name and carrying on about how great they are, what heroes, their sacrifices etc. Yes, fine, we get it. They are heroes. But this book is about YOUR life. Its as if he promised like 200 drinking buddies to include their names in his book and didn't want to reneg. Also, the butt kissing to Guliani teeters a bit on the excessive. Yes, Guliani is a grat man and kissing his butt is OK-just do it on your own time Bernie. 
 12 Poor White, Black, and Hispanic trash teenagers convicted of minor offenses take a trip to "the slammer" to meet up with some convicts.  The convicts goal is to scare the teenagers into cleaning up their act.  If not, the teens will have to face rape, subservience, torture, degradation, and death on a daily basis at the hands of other convicts.  The convicts get in the face of the teens and scare some sense into most of them.  Their is a follow up done on both the convicts and teens ten years later.  It turns out 3 teens/convicts died of AIDS related diseases, 2 of the convicts got out of prison, got busted for drugs in one case, sexual assault in the other.  Quite the role models, eh?  If you have a troubled teen, you may want to have them watch this.  If not though, I can't say this was entertaining.  I mean who wouldn't love an ignorant, muscle-bound, stinky-ass convict yelling at you at the top of his lungs about how he and his boys will be inserting something into your kiester if you choose to enter prison.    Not for the kiddies 
 I am a retired individual who has read just about every book written about Hawaii. Some have been classics; others rubbish. I'm afraid "Aloha Kauai: A Childhood" is close to the bottom of the range because it is just another run-of-the-mill autobiography written in the style of a high school dropout. It is a colorful little reminiscence about an island lifestyle in the middle of the last century but it was a struggle trying to continue reading from page to page. I give it a one star rating now with a plan to try to finish reading it some day. 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 Don't make my mistake and assume that this is a collection of music from the band that Rodriguez pulled together for Kill Bill 2 (including the incredible live performance on the DVD).  Check out Del Castillo, if you are looking for sounds that resemble that soundtrack. 
 I bought this movie for Casper Van Dien and Kim Cattrail and the hope that it would be a fun vampire movie. I fast forwarded through a lot of it due to the fact that it was not that interesting. I could not find one character in the movie to root for or care about. If you want a fun vamp show with a character to root for stick with Buffy 
 Sorry, Mr. Child, you imploded with this effort, almost as badly as the "facility." Too much pressure from your publisher to meet a deadline, perhaps? The plot has a few interesting aspects, such as the notion that aliens visited earth long ago and left something sinister behind (remember the John W. Campbell short novel "Who Goes There?"), but overall this book just falls flat. There is way too much psuedo-scientific astrophysics jargon for my taste (and I have an aeronautical/astronautical engineering degree). Character development is weak at best, and the science versus rigid-military-mind conflict is a very tired cliche. Readers of Utopia know that Child can write much better than this 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I am a graduate student and take a graduate level stat class called linear model using this book as a required textbook. Unfortunately I found this book is really not a good fit. The explanation is hard to understand, and the readers can easily get confused. Not worth the price. 
 For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it 
 This film was one of the assigned viewings for a History of Film class.  The professor specified the 180 minute version and specifically described the ending as being important to a complete analysis of the work.  My bad for not checking the specifics for this edition, but be forewarned:  if you want the full version, this is NOT it.  This version ends with Liberation.  Several other key scenes appear to have been edited out 
 This cd sounds like a bunch of 8-year-olds screaming. I like most of the original songs, but they are sung increadible badly by young kids. Most of these songs are meant to be sung by only one person, but the "Kidz Bop Kids" have about 10 people singing them at once. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! I'd give this 0 stars if I could, but there isn't an option for that 
 This book looked like it may be pretty funny to read, but unfortunately it was not.  I generally try to be kind in my reviews but I found this book to be so nauseating that I just had to write a negative review.  Mr.Stuever may be a talented writer technically, but the content of his articles is pretty pathetic.  He spends so much of his time being critical of others, that it leads me to wonder why he feels it is necessary to degrade others to help his own cause.  If you enjoy reading articles that are a constant derision and mockery of others, then this is the book for you.  If not, there are plenty of other funny reads out there.    
 I bought this book knowing that I would have to wait for volume 2, knowing what was in this volume and what was to be in the later volume.  As there's now no 2nd volume coming, the author appears to have misled his customers.  Reminds me of Solomon, somehow -- halves of some things aren't worth half the price of the whole thing 
 This looks like such a great toy, and the packaging is really impressive, but don't be fooled like we were. I assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-I don't expect much from plastic toys...but this is really really bad. You might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors...you know, 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed, but the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's "fun" factor. The "movable arm" is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..It doesn't even stay in. The "launch pad" and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. They don't connect to the shuttle, which was disapointed all of us, especially my son. And it is so cheaply made, I really can't believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. My son was so excited for this set. But after playing with it for just a few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again. I would definately NOT recommend this 
 Suicide Girls was started by a guy named Sean, and a lot of punk and goth girls saw it as "empowering" but it's just porn. Missy is the visible face but this is not a feminist enterprise. Wake up. Google them and read some of the stories of how they've screwed over models, faked diaries, self-censored themselves and taken pictures down, then lied and said they were targeted by the FBI. Sean has become a multimillionaire pornographer but there's nothing "alternative" here. I've seen the whole thing from the start 
 This book sold well in its German original, but I'm not sure why. It meanders and never gets to the point. Perhaps the writer meant to be impressionistic, but doesn't have the skill to really pull that off. Perhaps it was too literally translated, but I don't think that was the real problem. The translator seems to do well enough with the material he was presented with, even providing some explanatory footnotes for historical terms and aspects of life in the former GDR. And his translator's essay at the end of the book is superior to Hensel's jottings. I doubt Hensel is the right person to provide an interesting reminiscense of growing up in East Germany, or life since then. My suspicion is that this is a book by the kind of individual who gets by regardless of the kind of country they find themselves living in.  For a far more sympathetic and sensitive look at the same theme, try  the film "Goodbye, Lenin". This book already has a huge number of used copies available, and there's a reason for that 
 What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear.   Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment 
 hi zee this is francis how are you sweet heart you disapointed me by telling me that you had a better book coming out since last year remember we met in california come on zee you personnely admited that your book needed a lot of adjustin 
 The writing seems to have come from under-educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool.  I wasn't sure if I was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles.  This magazine isn't for men, it's for boys.   However, the one star is for the photos of the women which, we can't deny, both men and boys can appreciate 
 I purchased this item for my 4, almost 5 year old.  It is way over his head...not surprisingly as it is almost over mine.  As stated in another review, this looks more like a rescue vehicle than a firetruck...also...the multiple pieces that come with this toy make it that much more of an advanced toy...not really for a 3 year old.  The manufacter recommended age is 36 months to 8 years.  I would say more like 6 to 8 years and no less.  I almost feel like it is a collectors item that should be sitting on a shelf...so you don't lose it's parts...but I do not think the manufactuer's intended it to be so.  Unless your child is a perfectionist and super detailed...this really isn't the toy for them (in my opinion, of course) 
 I'm not impressed.  Don't get me wrong, there are some cute ideas in the book but no detailed instructions.  Their idea of instructions are:  1 - Draw outline.  2 - Create Whiskers.  3 - Fill in.  I would have liked it to say 1 - Begin drawing the outline by starting 3 inches above the cheekbone and make a curved line....and so on.  Since I'm not a creative person by nature I really wanted more instructions.  This is simply a book of ideas and heck, you can get that without the book!  I'm disappointed. 
 I had rectal cancer stage 4 with meth to the lungs and liver considered terminal with 1 or2 year to live.I folowed the recomendations in the book to the letter after 30 months I'm cancer free my CEA was 1230 now is less than 1 ready to celebrate my 50 birthday in october life is great ,don't give up hope, never .God bless 
 When I saw this movie I was thinking what kind of person would even decide to make this movie.  They would've saved a lot of money if they just decided to not make this movie at all.  First of all, the special effects were just horrible and the scenes were just like Turbulence.  If I were you i would stay away from that movie 
 Walker's book, We Can't Go Home Again, is a poor attempt to debunk Afrocentrism (more appropriately termed Afrocentricity). The book quickly develops serious flaws. Walker's conscious and purposeful reference to Black people as "Negroes" (without offering any context) only exemplifies his frame of reference and places him outside of serious dialogue. He admittedly demonstrates a limited scope of Afrocentricity by focusing on the supposed primacy of Ancient Egypt (Kemet) within Afrocentricity's epistemological framework while not even briefly exploring other main tenets. It appears, as with other attempts, that this critique is only put forth to sensationalize the issue and not to engage in a constructive exploration of what should/could be done about the modern Afrocentric movement. For those wishing to understand the possibilities and limitations Afrocentricity, there are far better texts that this one 
 set against the background of the serbian-bosnian war, this reeks of a significant piece of theater masquerading as a significant piece of cinema. while a wounded soldier lies on a landmine that will go off as soon as he moves, he is argued over by both sides, UN peacekeepers, and a television news crew. a silly pretense (he simply shouldve been allowed to blow himself up) and views of the effete futility of the peacekeepers and the cynicism of the television reporters that we have seen for decades now in better written, better acted, and better directed movies. suspenseful, at least? yeh, as suspenseful as an american cheese sandwich. 
 Sorry-- I don't know what people are raving about.  I am an avid epicurean, and have gone to most good restaurants in NY.  I just don't think Balthazar's recipes or food holds a candle to other NY institutions, like Gotham, Gramercy, etc.  The food at and recipes from Balthazar always tastes a little too greasy and unrefined given how many steps are involved.  Sorry, that's just my personal opinion after making almost ten of the Balthazar recipes 
 Difficult to criticise such a book. Nonetheless, the accumulation of sometimes small, sometimes big inaccuracies casts a shadow on the value of the work of Mrs.Hamilton-Meritt.  There is strong evidence of massive -to  the Laotian scale- use of toxic agents against Laotian opponents to the  present regime, including voluntary targetting of civilians. This book is a  useful testimony of the suffering of a population extensively used by the  US governement and then quietly abandonned. But it is maybe not as  clear-cut as exposed. Opium is an issue altogether avoided. The French  actively promoted its cultivation to take advantage of the smoking habits  of some Indonchinese. French Indonchina was a net importer of raw opium,  and it certainly was not for 'medical uses'. The hill-tribes continued  their ancestral cultivation of the poppy during the various conflicts and  still do. All sides found a profit there, either because of a direct  involvement in the traffic, or more beningly in perceiving a tax on the raw  opium or ensuring its safe passage in their zone of control for a fee. Not  a word of this in the book. Similarly, posing the Neutralists as straight  allies of the Communists is rather surprising, at best. Finally, the Hmong  were not alone, some Laotian officers and soldiers were brave, and the  Thais also played a major role in MR2, with up to 16 infantry battalions  and 3 artillery battalions in the field.  The reality has a few more shades  of grey than this book 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 This is probably the worst guide book I have ever owned, and I own a lot of guide books.  I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better.  If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business.  It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it.  The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years).  Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook 
 While Ms Shomon's book quotes several CFS doctors, she relies mainly on Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum's advice which includes a barrage of vitamins.  His book is titled "From Fatigued to Fantastic" and he wrote the introduction to Ms. Shomon's.  It bothers me that Ms. Shomon presents many alternative therapies that are highly suspect and cost prohibitive for the most of us.  However, she speaks from experience having suffered from CFS.  It bothers me that she does not mention Kutapressin, an amino acid injection that my doctor and many others in the field use 
 I was given this edition of Shakespeare for a Christmas one year when I was young. Once I began to appreciate Shakespeare, I did some readings in this work. It was okay.  Then it became painfully obvious: with no line numbers, no margin space for notes, abridged names, no footnotes nor any research, it became rather difficult to closely study Shakespeare with this edition.  That is when I purchased the Norton edition of Shakespeare. Although there are still abridged names, it has a very clear layout, notes, and enough margin to make anybody happy 
 Ayelet Waldman is a graduate of Harvard Law School, so I assume she's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer. She should stick to what she knows. The fact that she's married to a famous author doesn't make her a writer. Her novel is poorly written, overly sentimental and, to put it bluntly, very dumb.  What's next? Padma Lakshmi writing a novel because she's married to Salman Rushdie?  
 The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful.  It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated.  Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices.  It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book 
 More like a diary of some of Tom's successes (and he has had many) but only a few anecdotes.  Buy one of TJ Cloutier's books (or Slansky's) for much much more insight 
 I think a better and more thorough discussion of the rastafarian movement is The Rastafarians by Sr., Leonard E. Barrett. Douglas's thoughts seem to jump around in the book with long lists of individuals whose signifigance and part in the rastafarian movement needs more clarity. 
 Way too much radio techno talk...who cares about "segues" or what disk jockeys talk about in detail to play. Basic story okay but not nearly up to his prior books...especially Heart Seizure which was the best 
 I would like to write a favorable review of this book, but I honestly can't.  You see, I am a Nebraskan and my father knew the Sandoz family growing up in western Nebraska. However, this is a hard book to read and at times, as dull and lifeless as the Nebraska prarie that Ms Sandoz describes.  For someone looking to learn more about western Nebraska during the late 1800's to early 1900's I suggest picking up a Willa Cather novel 
 I agree with the last reviewer, the questions in this book are ones that maybe you would ask someone in the first month or so of dating but after that if you have any type of conversation skills you would have already found out the answers to 99% of the questions. Don't waste your money. 
 This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked 
 This is by far the most boring Beverley book, although competing for the title with her next, "To Rescue a Rogue."  The beginning is quite promising.  But than the action just stalls.  The love story is completely unconvincing and sorely lacking any tension.  Throughout the book, Jane agonizes whether to tell Simon the secret we readers know.  St. Bride is described as a wild character, with adventurous blood of his ancestor Ademar running through his veins.  But he comes across as a wimp.  Also, he marries the woman he barely knows when it is not quite clear that he is even attracted to her.  To fulfil a dying friend's wish?  Who on earth does that without an excellent reason, even in a romance novel?  It is not so clear how this man obliged our hero.  Then, after talking to his friend Hal, who really is in love, Simon decides that he too is "thunderstruck."  It just doesn't fly.   Apart from the somewhat interesting beginning -- very little is going on in the rest of the book. Just extremely boring conversations. Simon's cause -- fighting for the rights of Canadian Indians -- is entirely undeveloped.  He just drops this idea to go home and "do his duty" to the family.   In my opinion, reading an old Beverley book for the second or third time is time better spent 
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 Okay, I admit it, I bought this shirt because I thought it was sexy and it is.  But the labeling peels off after only one wash.  Who is going to hand-wash a workout shirt?   Looks good if you are extremely buffed 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
